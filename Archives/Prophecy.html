<div class="content">
O, how the heart aches<br>
O, how the mind quakes<br>
Thee, who bears<br>
So soothe thy nightmares<br><br>

T'is prophecy which stands afore in everlasting ink,<br>
Who speaks of time of gold brought to ruin,<br>
Rise up o champion, and sets the wheels in motion.<br>
<br>
Yet thou ist not chosen, for thous't lack the key.<br>
Four stand afore,<br>
And innumerable uncertain allies all around.<br>
The greatest burden is yours.<br>
<br>
Four worlds drawn together, four cardinals flutt'ring free,<br>
Each with wings pure as soul, yet unknowingly blessed by fate.<br>
<br>
The first champion found in sunrise, birth'd of a champion upon said rising sun,<br>
With no cradle for life and yet profound reverence for it.<br>
Rise up so high she shall, carried on the wings of the time of gold,<br>
Only to find the golden light hath torn her wings and let her fall.<br>
In this greatest hour, this first shall never believe her footing.<br>
Shoulders stand firmly fixed, but she shall believe them half their worth.<br>
O, first borne chosen, thine pure tears of divine fall silent.<br>
Silent and pure, like the sanguine drips of the same.<br>
You shall know death, for it is all around you.<br>
And yet...Thou shall create death so only to prevent it.<br>
This shall be your greatest burden.<br>
  <br>
O second chosen, thou'st know the pain of the first.<br>
Ever searching, thine bearer of great magics,<br>
These and more flow from thine heart.<br>
None greater at understanding,<br>
None greater at compassion,<br>
None greater at sadness,<br>
Thine ist second chosen, borne of legends long lost.<br>
You shall know death, and it shall destroy you.<br>
Death itself shall be that which weighs most heavily upon you.<br>
Death itself, your greatest burden.<br>
Never to know thine great importance, and yet,<br>
The second chosen shall choose the third.<br>
<br>
And O! Ye second chosen shall choose,<br>
And such third chosen will be a grand foil,<br>
But great champions forge great bonds, and thine unbreakable.<br>
A burning desire,<br>
A burning fury,<br>
A burning longing,<br>
Thou'st the third, knowing once more the pain of the first and indeed the second,<br>
And it shall be the only pain you know, <br>
For all else will crumble from your plumage like ash.<br>
But in this loss thou shall find comfort, like honey and slufer,<br>
Both shall leave no taste, for yours is a mind anew.<br>
Thou'st been cradled by death, and death does cradle you,<br>
It nurtures, yet you forget yourself in its chilling grasp.<br>
It shall become the greatest burden in simplicity,<br>
That your burdens cannot last, lest they crush your heart,<br>
And you may erupt into great violence and lose yourself.<br>
You shall know death, and after death you will know nothing but death.<br>
Thou'st been chosen, but thou'st died.<br>
And so the world asks:<br>
Why?<br>
Whyfore hast thou passed before the time of greatest destiny?<br>
Why, when thou'st bear the choice of the second, hast thou died?<br>
It is only through the choice of the second that you do live.<br>
The time shall come where you are needed...<br>
But even divination,<br>
Even prophecy,<br>
Even sight of the future knows not what blurred lines hide thine heart.<br>
Shall you watch the world burn, or perhaps yourself burn?<br>
Will you ease the world's greatest burden?<br>
Thou'st already died, so burdens of others you may not bear.<br>
  <br>
And so ye fourth,<br>
Like the third, thou knows death.<br>
So many moons ago did thou kiss death's cold cheek.<br>
Thou knows the same pain as those afore,<br>
Thou knows death.<br>
The world afore you gone,<br>
The world anew lay afore.<br>
It shall not be the first chosen,<br>
But it shall be one who shares the celestial name,<br>
That shepherds you away from death's embrace.<br>
Watched by Light and held by Dawn, thou'st known ultimate mercy.<br>
One thousand early breaths soothe your rest,<br>
But a greater calling pulls you to where Light has left her mark,<br>
Mark'd by Light and watched by Dawn, it is your touch,<br>
O, fourth chosen, it is your touch that will summon great magics.<br>
Thou is without a great burden, and so thou is the key.<br>
But thou cannot cure this burden alone.<br>
No chosen can.<br>
<br>
O, four chosen, thou know not who you are.<br>
Thou shall not be summon'd of accords within one's self,<br>
But rather guided by the one who believes.<br>
<br>
Believe, chosen. For she believes.<br>
And it is she who listens for these words.
