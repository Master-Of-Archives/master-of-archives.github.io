</p><p class="journal">
  	The world around me grows colder, and darker, with every weakening beat of my heart. Laying face-down atop a bed of late November leaves and soft snow-dusted earth, I whisper my final regrets within the quiet recess of my mind. The air the blows calmly over me is cold, cold enough that the blood that trickles from my torn skin - most prominently the arrow wounds in my back - has frozen on the ground. I haven't the strength to shiver any longer. I haven't the desire to keep fighting. Petty vengeance, and the sins of association and place of birth are what have damned me. I will die, because I have practiced the magical healing rites of my people upon a suffering group who were declared enemies of the kingdom whose knights let fly piercing iron which presently drains my vital force. It wasn't enough to just shoot me with the arrows, of course. A sword stab wound in my side, and the bruises of iron sabatons from being stomped on and kicked round out the battering my body has taken to reach this sorry state. All because I broke a curse that afflicted people that the king said should be left for dead.
</p><p class="journal">
	I want not to think ill of those who have wronged me; caught in a political game wherein a king upon a throne alone acted in greed and tyranny that cascaded down to all those under his gluttonous iron fist, those three knights would have never known me or my people to be the advocates of peace and magic that we are. It is with these parting thoughts that I feel at ease, and that in my final moments I have peace. I have serenity. I can pass onto the next life, and in that passing I will carry no burdens of hatred or malice.
</p><p class="journal">
	My eyes, already heavy and half-lidded, begin to drift closed towards death...
</p><p class="journal">
	...Only to open again as I fixate, as best as my blurry and wavering vision can, on a glowing figure approaching me as drawn by the sound of snow and leaves gently crunching underfoot. Feminine, clad in brilliant white gossamer, and...Are those...Wings? I attempt to focus, and the wings take more definite shape. Pearl-white feathers that match cascading hair spilling over the figure's shoulders and down their back. She approaches slowly, with hands folded before her and grace in her stride. 
</p><p class="journal">
	An...Angel? Is this to be my shepherd into the next life? Have I earned a passage into the glorious afterlife of paradise? Had I any strength, I would smile. I was already at peace, but now my heart swells with acceptance, ready to embrace my journey to the life beyond. She descends to her knees beside me, legs pressed together while she then leans back to sit on her legs with hands on her lap. She then extends a hand outward to brush against my cheek. I am covered in dirt, no doubt, but she does not care. I look up and see her face. See her...Smile. Something about her touch drives away the cold. Rather than lift my spirit away, it strengthens me and my bond to this life. She comes more into focus; the glow I saw was an aura of pure white which surrounds her. Upon her neck, there is a brilliant necklace, glorious and ornate as though crafted by the gods themselves - perhaps it quite literally was? The necklace bears a pendant. A massive, immaculate sapphire gem that sparkles and shines even in the dim light of this twilight. Her eyes are perhaps the only blue gems that could dare rival this pendant. Truly...I am looking upon the face of divinity.
</p><p class="journal">
	Her hand leaves my cheek, and when next I feel it it is upon my back. The initial tingle of magic that I know so well soon blossoms into a power unlike anything I've ever felt. So potent and invigorating, so soothing and delicate that it makes the healing magics that I had learned seem like snake oil to this elixir of life pouring into me. I gasp the first full breath of frigid air I had managed since my back was pierced. White envelops my vision, and the cold gives way to warmth. Numbness gives way to vigor. Pain melts away to a dull throb. When the white fades a minute later, I see the fletching of the discarded arrows out of the upper corner of my periphery. I'm slowly turned to lay on my back, and my head is moved to rest on her lap.
</p><p class="journal">
	My vision takes time to adjust, but I soon see clearly again. I see her now with clarity. She is looking down at me, smiling that same calm smile...Though now that I can see it without the haze of death blurring everything, there is a sorrow in her features. My heart, having just been reminded how to properly beat, sinks into my stomach. How could a being so pure as she bear sadness? Does she not live to bring happiness? So said the legends of angels I had read, at least. I haven't much time to think on this, as she soon cups her hands together to then bring to my lips. Hands once empty now are full of water. She is careful, graceful, as she guides the tips of her fingers to my lips and tilts them just slightly. My lips are dry, dirty, and cracked, but this water pouring past them plumps and invigorates them while I take in the slow trickle of refreshing liquid. Swallowing is hard at first, but becomes easier with each repetition.
</p><p class="journal">
	When her palms are empty again, her thumb trails over my lips, then palm over my cheek - the opposite of the last. Each place she touches feels cleaner, as if washing away one at a time every mark of my once grim fate. I can only stare up at her, and in doing so realize that she looks like me in some regards, while opposite in others. Her features are softer, smoothed over by this divine grace that suffuses her. Her eyes, a beautifully deep and vibrant blue, contrast directly against the bright scarlets that I possess, just as her white hair does to my onyx locks. In those ways, she is my opposite. The compassion in her eyes, however, is something I long to possess within myself to such a depth that I presently witness - in that, we are the same, even if I am looking up at her. I care for others selflessly, of that I am firm within my heart. Altruism and sacrifice are part of who I strive to be, yet...She embodies them already so flawlessly. Why, then, does she seem so sad..?
</p><p class="journal">
	Swiftly, I feel the culmination of all the fatigue and stress my near-death experience had burdened me with. With a single exhale, the world around me begins to fade to pleasant slumber.
</p><p class="journal">




</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~

</p><p class="journal">
Screams. I hear screams. Horrific, terrifying screams of someone suffering beyond measure and compare. I cannot wake. I cannot help. My body is too weak. Her screams continue...

</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~



</p><p class="journal">
	When I again wake, I'm in a bed. It is a comfortable bed, but has little room to move from my current position on my back. My bones and muscles protest to even the thought, regardless. Candlelight illuminates the small room in this cabin. Snow falls outside. It gives me a powerful moment of reflection; like these trees, I was so very close to death. A shell, pallid and stripped of that which sustains me. Like the forest will mimic come spring, a light had broken through and touched me, and life again was breathed into me. Of course I know I am not a tree, but there is beauty in it. In giving life. In revival.
</p><p class="journal">
	My vision clears, shaken of fatigue. To my left, sitting upon a wooden chair, she is there. Her immaculate white wings are curled in and around herself, crossed over one another. Her eyes are closed at first, but she seems to sense that I'm awake and also opens her eyes to look at me. Her wings unfurl, and she gives me another smile. Still, that sorrow lingers...On just the corners of the lips, the light upward curl of her brows, and deep within her eyes. It evokes a profound sorrow in me. Why, angel? Why do you suffer?
</p><p class="journal">
	"I'm glad that I found you. I fear if I were any later, a great tragedy would have transpired," says the angel.
</p><p class="journal">
	"A great--" I cough, which only makes everything hurt worse. She looks worried, and moves a hand to rest on my shoulder. It's soothing. "...Tragedy?"
</p><p class="journal">
	She nods. "Yes. You would have died. Death of the innocent is one of the greatest tragedies."
</p><p class="journal">
	I suppose I can't disagree, but something in my gut demands I downplay how tragic it would have been. "I didn't think I warranted such a rescue. How could you be so sure I'm so innocent, anyway?" Rather than answer in words, she gives a knowing, somewhat playful smile. Oh. Duh. "...R-Right. So you're...An angel?"
</p><p class="journal">
	She nods again. "I am. And you are an innocent woman." She smiles at me again. "I don't suppose you have a name?"
</p><p class="journal">
	"Valentina. Am I...Allowed to ask you yours?"
</p><p class="journal">
	She giggles, then sits pensive for a moment. Perhaps I was right to not be so certain about it? "Sapphire."
</p><p class="journal">
	I look at her, then down at her necklace, then back up to her. I suspect that might not be her real name, or if it is, maybe the necklace was because of the name rather than coming up with that on the spot just to give me a false one? She catches me looking, and just smiles. Which...Doesn't really answer my silent question. I probably shouldn't be so skeptical; it's not like I have some right to divine secrets. She did just save my life, too. So why do I feel so undeserving..? While I am thinking on this, she examines the crest upon my black robes; a pair of white feathers crossed low on the stem, inside a white circle. The mark of my people.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Eruzia. We are scholars and healers. I suppose if I was a better healer, I might not have needed your help," I say, trying to give my best joking smile. My body still refuses to do most things painlessly. She smiles, but still there is a lingering sorrow. Pain, even.
</p><p class="journal">
	"We all need a little help sometimes. What healing magics do you use?"
</p><p class="journal">
	"Well...I study curses. I dedicate my life to removing them. I am called a Hexbreaker." Something about this registers with Sapphire. She looks almost...Shocked. I raise a brow at her.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Oh, never mind me. I suppose I just am accustomed to hearing more typical answers to such a question." She blushes. It's...cute. Even celestials are not immune to embarrassment, it seems. It makes her feel more...Human.
</p><p class="journal">
	"I know minor healing as well, but the others in my clan are better; I was born with this gift, and my guildmaster guided me to embrace it rather than pursue what is perceived as the most pure. We all fill a role, and even if I do not help as many due to my esoteric pursuits, I know that they would not be helped without someone like me. Reliance on my allies to care for those I cannot means the greatest amount of good is done."
</p><p class="journal">
	Sapphire nods, and we continue to discuss for some time. Talks of my work, those I have helped. I tell her of those who abuse me within Eruzia; many healers within feel I and the other hexbreakers are a blight. That the good we do is nullified by the dangers of our existence. I tell her of Mizara, and how they have mentored me from a very young age. She listens patiently, and smiles brighter every time I speak of the happiness I feel just in seeing others smile. Seeing their curses broken. I tell her of the political situation of the land, of what led to my fate, and how I bear no malice for those who wronged me. She pauses now and again to think on my words, but remains wholly attentive the entire time. We focus greatly on the morality of it all. She asks me many pointed questions about my position on various quandaries. Many other questions guide us towards the nature of conflict, the nature of loss, and the subject of hope. Each time she asks of hope, there is hope in her eyes. Hope that I will answer in a way that gives hope, rather than succumbing to despair. It gives me insight into that sadness I see in her.
</p><p class="journal">
 	She departs after a few hours of talk in search of food and water, and I rest while she is away.
</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~*~
</p><p class="journal">
	In my dream, I see her. She appears to me nude, though clouds of misty air cover her, showing only patches of skin. Shining through the mist is her necklace. It shines brightly, but brings with it rain. I try to speak, but I cannot. She looks at me, and the same smile which bares untold pain persists. Though it is raining, my dream convinces me that she is crying. She says nothing, but the shimmer of her necklace grows brighter; she is floating a foot or so above me, with legs together and slightly crossed as they dangle below her. Her wings are behind her, wide and proud, and her hands are cupped toward one another, spaced evenly on either side of the pendant around her neck, channeling its power.
</p><p class="journal">
	As the power grows, detectable by the distinct tingle of magic within the air, the rain gets heavier. One drop falls upon her shoulder and marks it red, swiftly then washed by further droplets. Another drop of blood falls, and then another, and before I have even time to reach out to her, the blood rain that falls over us has turned to a deluge. The scent is overwhelming, and I find myself paralyzed and watching onward as the level rises to swiftly consume us both. It floods my senses; the metallic taste brings with it flashbacks of where my own blood drenched my mouth. I panic, and try to swim upward, but am as paralyzed now as I was then. I cannot move. I can only watch in horror as this blood rain swallows us both.
</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~*~
</p><p class="journal">
	"AAH!" I cry, bolting awake and shooting up in the bed. My heart is pounding, as is my head. A few shaking breaths follow before it registers that Sapphire's hand is already upon my shoulders. She looks at me, genuinely and greatly concerned. A few more deep huffs are required before I find my composure again. "I...I'm all right, I...Nightmare."
</p><p class="journal">
	Sapphire nods again. Her concerned look eases, but only just. I notice she has food - bread, meat, water, fruits...Where did she get all of that? We must be half a day's travel from the nearest village...Well. On foot, anyway. "It's all right, Valentina. Lay back down. You're still in need of rest."
</p><p class="journal">
	I nod reluctantly. Being so passive about this is frustrating; I do need to return to helping others...Though as the adrenaline ebbs, I am reminded why I am bedridden by protesting muscles. I obey, and she shares the food she had brought with me. It had been far longer than I admit to her since I had last eaten - not for lack of trying, just had been prioritizing the aide of others over that trivial detail. We share in food, though my appetite does not allow for much.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Does it not bother you that you do so little in the grand scheme of things? That you cannot save the world single-handedly?" asks Sapphire after some pensive silence. She has a face of genuine curiosity. I don't think she meant to offend with it, so I take none.
</p><p class="journal">
	I think for a moment to give the question due consideration. It certainly sounds serious. "I wouldn't say that it's little. It's a necessary component; there's less need for it, but the need that does arise cannot be addressed in any other way. Every member of a team fulfills a role. It doesn't bother me, no. I just look for ways to do more. Ways to be stronger. To better myself, for the benefit of everyone else."
</p><p class="journal">
	Something about what I said seems to sting in Sapphire's heart, but she recovers quickly. "I see. It's very admirable, what you do. The way you think, too."
</p><p class="journal">
	Now it's my turn to blush. Being complimented by an angel..? I still haven't ruled out the possibility that I really am just dead and this is a dream. That I have dreams in. Going to extreme lengths to fool myself sounds like something my brain would do. I can't say much else besides a meek thanks for a few moments. "I don't really know that I deserve such kind words from an angel.."
</p><p class="journal">
	"Oh? Would hearing them from someone else make the deeds themselves more worthy of the praise?" she asks with that somewhat common playfulness she possesses.
</p><p class="journal">
	"N-No, well, I...Just didn't imagine them up to the standards of the divine."
</p><p class="journal">
	This just makes her smile wider. "No altruistic deed is too small to be praised. It never should be done for the sake of earning that praise or recognition, but when it is done, the altruistic deserve to feel a modest pride for their deeds. Most deeds will go unrecognized, others still will be recognized in a way that will seem coincidental to the doer of good, but that does not change the ideal."
</p><p class="journal">
	I smile at her. "That's very true...I guess I just never thought it applied to me. More modesty than pride." Her expression softens again as she dons a smile at my poor attempt at humor, and she leans forward to gently brush her hand over my forehead and through my hair. It sends tingles all through me, and I close my eyes to relax into the sensation. If this were anyone else, I would probably find it creepy, but I don't find it so unreasonable to have a high degree of trust in her. Between saving my life and that whole 'is a being of ultimate virtue, charity, kindness, and love', I think they've earned this much at least. Plus, it helps to distract from the aches all over my body - predominantly in my side. She elects not to respond to me, and instead just continues with this motion. I've only been awake for a short time, but it was a sleep that was interrupted. I feel sleep creeping up on me again.
</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~*~
</p><p class="journal">
	I don't know when it happened, but I had passed out into a (thankfully) dreamless sleep while Sapphire was...Petting me? When my eyes open, she's not here. My heart sinks in thinking she has disappeared for good, but rationally my mind assumes she could just as easily gone to get more food and water. I try to sit up, but my soreness is just getting worse. The lingering effect of just being touched by Sapphire made all this ache go from debilitating to just annoying. Now it takes a gargantuan effort to just lift any part of me. Resigned to my fate of bed rest, I occupy myself with staring out the window. The snow is getting heavier, and it's collecting on the branches. I was hoping to be done with my travels before the weather grew to be so unfavorable. Nothing to be done about it now except hope that this log cabin doesn't belong to some psychopath who is going to show up after Sapphire departs for good and all of this ends up being for nothing.
</p><p class="journal">
	I spend the next few hours in thought, drifting in and out of light sleep and attempting a few times to shift to my side or to lay on my stomach. Each transition takes a handful of minutes with plenty of straining, to the point that I even begin to sweat right about the time I finally grow comfortable. My heart feels heavy, and it aches worse than the former site of my sword wound. The longer I spend alone, the more I worry Sapphire won't be coming back. I expect she'll leave at some point, of course...I can't expect a literal angel to remain in my life long, let alone forever. The fact that she is still here is a miracle in itself. But this feeling is confusing. Even though I know she won't be here long, I still feel a need to cling to her. And of course, just when I get around to convincing myself she isn't coming back, and tears well up in my eyes, she walks in.
</p><p class="journal">
	I must have made a really stupid face, because she locks eyes with me swiftly and looks slightly surprised, then blushes, then smiles. My heart is fluttering now, and in all my stupid staring at her, I forget to greet her. She seems fine with the silence though, and slowly makes her way back to the chair at my bedside. When she had entered, her wings were folded around herself; she now unfurls them again. I don't know if I will ever be able to look at those beautiful wings without being in awe. An angel! Seriously! It's been hard to focus so much on that with all that near-death business, but this is the sort of thing exactly nobody is going to believe, if I ever feel the need to tell them.
</p><p class="journal">
	"How are you feeling?" asks Sapphire.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Sore."
</p><p class="journal">
	Sapphire purses her lips to the side. She blushes again, and her gaze shifts sideways briefly. I raise a brow at her curiously. She steps closer, to the side of the bed. "This is going to sound weird," she begins, "but uhm...I'd like to help, it would just work best if you, well, took your robes off. Or maybe just like...Push them up I guess."
</p><p class="journal">
	Now it's my turn to blush. I'm not ashamed of my figure; on the contrary I think I look nice. That doesn't mean I want to be nude, though; even with the chest-wrap covering that part, it still feels...Bah! It's for my own good, right? It's not like this angel is going to do anything creepy. I sheepishly start to fumble with my robes, making things infinitely more awkward by not saying anything, and slowly pull them off my figure, setting them at the side of the bed. Sapphire draws closer, then kneels beside the bed. I can't make eye contact; it'd probably not be well-received to mention in this moment that I'm sexually open and having a beautiful woman's hands on me is...Well...At least it's making the ache subside. I can't tell if that's because she just has a literal healing touch or because my heart is injecting adrenaline into my everywhere. She eases me onto my side, so my back is to her. Probably the best case scenario. And once that is done, she rests her open hands on my back. I feel more of the pure, potent energy of this angel flowing into me, and my aches are swift to melt away. It evokes a heavy exhale mixed with a groan. The moment it leaves my lips, I bite into them. That...That sounded weird. It's a good thing eye contact isn't an option right now. In just my underwear, with hands that were literally divine roaming over my bare skin, did I expect that my mind wouldn't wander? Images of her body pressed to mine and being able to return the favor of roaming hands to her figure flow through my mind. It feels selfish and wrong of me to think this way about someone like this. Mizara would have endless chastisement for me, no doubt.
</p><p class="journal">
	But just as I'm about to turn over and try to play it off like I'm fine now and they can stop, she does just that. Did I offend her? I am afraid to turn around now. After a few moments, I hear cloth rustling. Then, the bed sinks lightly behind me, and Sapphire's figure presses into me from behind. I inhale deeply. My cheeks burn. Her wings fold around me, sliding in over my shoulders to cross over me, while her arms slide around my midsection. Her hands are warm, soft, and delicate. Her wings are plush, comforting, and in covering me form the most soothing blanket I have ever felt; truly, the position affords the most potent application of her healing that makes the echoes of wounds once mortal such child's play for her, leaving me so swiftly free of pain. I struggle to keep calm despite this, because the only thing separating us now is our underwear. Her legs gingerly slide against mine. Her hands cradle me. Her wings comfort me. I feel more connected to her than I've ever felt to anyone else before.
</p><p class="journal">
	We remain like this, wordlessly, for a long time. Eventually, I find it in me to become composed. Pain is a distant memory to me now. The literal embrace of this angel has purified me of all but the memory of my once grim fate, leaving me more invigorated than I ever have been. Yet, my body aches for a different reason now. The profoundly potent ache in my body now is such sweet agony. A self-induced ache of restraint. How I yearn to turn around and capture her lips, to hold her close, to hold her and never again let go. This position is so very intimate, yet impure thoughts remain far away. My soul, rather than my lust, is reaching out to her. And in this quiet embrace, I realize that which has been true from the moment I saw this beautiful woman...
</p><p class="journal">
	I'm falling in love.
</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~*~
</p><p class="journal">
	I don't know how long we were laying together. It felt simultaneously like an eternity, yet also just a single heartbeat. She had risen after however long and had donned her robes once more, then excused herself so I could do the same. I didn't. I couldn't. I just lay there on my back, staring at the roof as my heart thud in my chest with enough force to rock my entire body. Agony...Such sweet, sweet agony...Having her touch is too intense, but being without it creates the coldest sucking void in my chest. I am sweating, but I feel frozen. It hurts. And I would sooner have the arrows in my back again than suffer this pain. I curl into myself. My chest is throbbing. A pulsing, radiating, debilitating agony beats below my skin. I feel it in my hands, which I press together over my heart. I feel it in my feet. In my toes, which curl in. It hurts. It hurts so much. It's so stupid. So pathetic. She's just gone for a little while. She'll be back again. But I can't help feeling like she'll soon be lost to me forever. I never wanted her to rise from the bed. Her touch made me feel whole for perhaps the first time in my life, but when her hands left me they took with them so much more. I need her. I hardly know her but this intense pull in my soul can't mean anything else. My eyes sting and I start to cry. I choke. I sob. I shake. It's sensation that lingers for a few minutes, then subsides. My pathetic outburst leaves me curled up like a child, quietly begging with my entire being that Sapphire would return to laying with me. But I'm alone. So I just lay here.
</p><p class="journal">
	I lay like this for a long while. A long, long while where all I can think about is her face. Her beautiful face. Each time I see the sorrow in her eyes I myself feel the need to burst into tears. To just hold her. To kiss her all over so she knows she is beautiful, that she is loved, that she is not alone, that someone will fight for her and strip her of that which makes her so sad. I  sit up and don my robes once more, but this feeling is still there. I know in my heart it will always be there so long as I live. I have never known a feeling so potent. I thought I knew what love was. But the mild, tempered feelings I had felt before where sparks of a connection evoked small smiles and flutters within me were nothing compared to this. She makes me weak. She need only exist and I am transfixed by her being. I am in awe of her. And I have just begun to fall; the surface of the waters of love have just parted for me to descend into them, yet it took only the crashing of the waves back over to crush me. But rather than drown under the pressure, I beg for more. I dare to sink lower, willingly subjecting myself to the depths of this emotion, no matter how it hurts. And it does hurt.
</p><p class="journal">
	Sapphire returns again a short while after my stint of emotional insanity; thankfully long enough for me to calm and be rid of the emotional edge that would make it obvious I was crying over something so silly. She doesn't enter, just stands in the door frame looking in. I jump up with a burst of enthusiasm rising in me. I call her name in my mind, thankfully not aloud so as to spare myself the embarrassment of being so stupidly excited just to see someone. She smiles at me in a way that suggests she understood my excitement. Still, she seems to be waiting for something. I approach, body free of the aches of the wounds I suffered. When I draw close, she takes my hand and gently pulls me from the cabin, smiling all the while. After we exit the cabin, the world around us fades to white with an influx of magic. Just a second or so, and the world reforms, and we're elsewhere. Effortless teleportation...Were I not so transfixed on her beautiful blue eyes, I might have taken a moment to admire the magical prowess on display.
</p><p class="journal">
	We're now standing on a flat field of white. Bright, twinkling stars above, and a full moon to illuminate the earth. A two-inch layer of snow covers the ground. Sapphire is still holding my hand. We slow to a stop, and she looks at me. Our eyes lock, and I suspect it isn't the cold that then relieves me of feeling in my legs.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Beautiful...Isn't it?" she asks.
</p><p class="journal">
	Yes, you are. "..Hm?"
</p><p class="journal">
	"The snow."
</p><p class="journal">
	"Oh. Ehm. Yes. Very." I look upward. "The moon, as well." I look down again to meet Sapphire's gaze. To my surprise, her cheeks are bright red. Her eyes, those beautiful blue eyes, are fixed on me and are filled with an emotion that evokes pulsing weakness in my limbs. She is looking at me as I feel I look at her. She's boring straight into my soul. I am helpless. Such a simple gesture as looking at me, and it's left me utterly debilitated. Throat is dry, heart pounding, breaths short, thoughts normally so clear are a fuzz...I cannot deny it. I've fallen in love with this angel; what I lied to myself to say was just the start of my descent has blossomed into something far beyond without my realizing it. What I had always thought would be so gradual has struck me in an instant: I cannot be without her. In this moment, lost in her eyes, she takes each of my hands.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Would you dance with me, Valentina?" she asks. I nod, folding my hands around hers in return.
</p><p class="journal">
	"I'd love nothing more."
</p><p class="journal">
	And so we dance. I could look at this beautiful, picturesque scene. I could look at the powdery snow, once flat and unblemished until our shifting feet kicked it away to create a small ring in which we dance. I could look at the winter trees and the harmony of nature around us. I could look at the sky. The moon. The brilliant starfield of sky above. I could look at any of it, but then I would be forced to ask myself why my eyes did stray from the most beautiful sight this world had to offer. So I do not. I cannot. Our gazes are locked together. Her lips, tempting as they are, are curled in a radiant smile. We dance, though I am forced to follow her lead; she is a much better dancer than I, though I ought to remove my surprise for her ability to move gracefully in every context. We dance. We twirl. We laugh. We smile. We dance until our feet are tingling from the chill. Until clouds roll over the sky, leaving pockets in them so that the once full swath of moonlight turns to god-rays that illuminate our little pocket of snowy heaven. Until snow begins to fall again, lightly dusting our figures in its powdery presence. I want to kiss her. I want to take her as my own. My mind, my body, my soul, every fiber that I am demands that she be mine. And yet...I do not. Instead, I slide closer to her, and pull her to me, so that we can hold one another in this perfect moonlit night. Her arms slide around me, as do her wings, and we bask in the presence of one another. Our souls reach out for one another, and the powerful emotional fulfillment that only love can bring radiates from my heart.
</p><p class="journal">
	I want to remember this moment for the rest of my days, no matter what happens. I focus on it yet lose myself in it for what feels like seconds, but must have been nearly half an hour. I savor it. I will always cherish it. It is only when we slowly part from this embrace - though Sapphire's wings still envelop me - that I see that which I have been blind to all this time.
</p><p class="journal">
	She is cursed.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Sapphire.." I whisper. She must detect the concern in my voice, for her once serene expression shifts to an inquisitive one. I touch her necklace. It's faint...It's trying to hide itself. But I can feel it. I can speak the language in which hexes whisper, and I do hear them whisper to me now. I look at her knowingly. With sympathy and sorrow. She knows that I know; her head dips and she dons an understanding smile.
</p><p class="journal">
	"...Yes, I know. It is but a minor curse. Stubborn and unrelenting, but its effects are warded by my angelic nature." She smiles. My mind screams at me to disagree; I can feel this curse with clear understanding, and it is anything but minor. But as loud as that voice is...Sapphire is an angel. A master of the arcane, and of the divine. A paragon of strength and virtue. What is realm-shattering to me may prove minor to her. So I stow my objections and nod lightly.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Let me look at it someday. I am adept with hexes. Even if I cannot break it now, there has never been a curse I could not undo with enough time." Sapphire smiles at me. A smile that says it is a lofty, but wholesome goal. She rests her hands over one of mine, holding it between them with a tenderness I have never known before meeting her.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Someday." She pauses. Her eyes wander, then flick back to mine. "And...Valentina?" She pauses again, searching for the words perhaps, then smiles. "Thank you."
</p><p class="journal">
	"...Pardon?" What reason in the name of all the gods above could she possibly have to thank me? She saved my life, showed me a kindness and grace that I had thought impossible, given me a new outlook on life, has shown me what true love feels like...And she is thanking me?
</p><p class="journal">
	"For showing me what it means to hold hope even in the face of great pain. For showing me that cruelty can still be met with kindness. That it is never impossible to find and foster good in others." She pauses, smiling more brightly as cheeks once again turn pink. Her hands guide my lone one up to her heart, laying it upon the white gossamer of her dress to feel the pounding below. "For letting me in. For letting me know you...So I could fall in love with you."
</p><p class="journal">
	"...?!" Time freezes. I cannot speak. I cannot think. My entire body is on fire. I'm shaking inside, but my body is paralyzed. My heart beats a single explosive burst upon hearing those words. But after? I cannot feel it. Nor anything else...Except for her. My hand upon her. Her heartbeat. Her presence. Her aura. I am petrified by one simple admission, yet at the same time have never felt less afraid. She reaches a hand forward, rubbing a thumb under my eye.
</p><p class="journal">
	"...Why does that make you cry, Valentina..?" That snaps me out of it. She must think I'm sad. I can't have her hurt, after taking this leap of faith to bare her heart to me. I step forward and throw my arms around her, pulling her against me so tightly that she must know I will never again let her go.
</p><p class="journal">
	"I love you, Sapphire," I whisper. No, not a whisper.. "I love you! I love you, Sapphire!" I'll shout it. I'll scream it. I'll sing it until it echoes from the mountaintops for all the world to hear. Then, and only then, will my heart be satisfied. Her arms slide up my back, and her wings tighten around me. I'm shaking, and so is she. But the cold could not for a thousand years encroach upon the warmth of us together as we are. No, it is just the breath of fresh air invigorating lungs starved of a truly full breath, which suffuse us both with the truest feelings of love that we bare for one another. My heart is going to explode. Though I nearly died just a handful of days ago, I've never felt more alive than I do right now. And there is but a single thing I can think of that will make this moment perfect. I pull back. I look at her, this beautiful woman I have fallen for. I smile, reaching a hand forward to rub my thumb across to rub away a tear. She giggles. Then I do. Then our gazes soften, locked with one another. I slide my hand back to cup the back of her neck. Her eyes slide closed and lips part. I follow suit, and our lips slowly seek their destiny.
</p><p class="journal">
	But then something isn't right. A powerful, overwhelming magic surges from her necklace. I open my eyes again, immediately scanning for danger in or around her. Her eyes are open now too, but they aren't looking at me. They are looking past me. Far...Far beyond me. Fresh tears start to stream from her eyes. I search for meaning as fear overtakes me and panic clouds my reasoning. I call her name, but she doesn't respond. I grip her shoulders and gently shake her, seeking to inspire focus again. But instead, I'm flung from her as a powerful shockwave bursts from her necklace. I land on my back, looking up at the now moonless, cloudy sky, with a grunt. I push up, and I see her just as she falls to her knees, and releases what would come to be fuel for my nightmares for the rest of my life. A terrifying, blood-chilling scream of agony wailing out into the night. From the highest high I fall to a feeling so lower than low that it saps my will to live in all but one purpose: I must save her.
</p><p class="journal">
	I am on my feet in moments, scrambling those precious few feet to then stumble down onto my knees again. I reach out to her, ready to pull her down with me into the snow and hold her close. But when I land on my stomach, grunting, my arms are as empty as my heart. She is gone. Just a single white feather is left. Her scream echoes in my mind to fill the void of this silent night. I reach out to take the feather. The world has become so cold; the snow on my face and hands is lukewarm by contrast. The snow is falling heavily. I am convinced that this is another nightmare; the most terrifying nightmares are ones that will not relent until they have broken me. Yet I am already broken, taken from my happiest moment in basking in the sun when I flew too close, now falling as my wings were burned by the scream of an angel.
</p><p class="journal">
	Now it is I that screams. I wail. I cry. I sob. Tears freeze to my face. I collapse to my side, curled inward like a dying animal, and pray for that same death. The mercy Sapphire showed me has inflicted upon me a pain that I cannot bear. At least with death came numbness. This pain is so visceral that my entire being burns with the ceaseless agony of every piece of me begging for death. I feel this pain for hours.
</p><p class="journal">
	Yet somewhere in this pain, after these hours of wading through its mire, I find strength. No, this was not Sapphire's doing. She did not wish this. She had only pure intent, and purest love for me. My hand which does not hold her feather balls into a fist, and drives into the snow. Flames burst from my figure and out some ten feet, creating a pocket of warmth and scorched earth where there was once snow. I stand. I wipe my eyes on my sleeve. I place her feather in the inner pocket of my robes that rests over my heart, and I make a proclamation:
</p><p class="journal">
	"Sapphire...If you are listening...I will not fail you. So long as I draw breath this is my solemn promise. I will lift this burden from you. I will save you from it. If it takes my entire life, I will find you and I will not fail. And even if my body should succumb to time, my spirit will shield you. I cannot...I will not ever allow you to suffer this curse. This I swear: Ini sia lex si mi agantal vis."
</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~*~
</p><p class="journal">
	And so began my journey. I was already an adept hexbreaker, but this curse that Sapphire was afflicted by? It would require I become the greatest hexbreaker that Eruzia had ever known, and ever would know. Tirelessly I worked. I no longer took the abuse that the others within Eruzia saw fit to impart on me. They declare me a freak for practicing hexes. But I am guided by a true purpose. I know that there is great need of my gifts. If only for one person, for Sapphire, I know I am needed. Words reveal their secrets to me like never before. Sleep is a luxury my mind no longer requires until it has absorbed all the knowledge of the great Eruzian library for the day that it can hold; sleep then is only a utility to process this all and build my understanding. Dreams become mental exercises. Words become insufficient, and my rate of understanding slow.
</p><p class="journal">
	I ask Mizara to weave curses for me to unravel. Puzzles; hexes without actual affliction but only with increasingly complex layers of binding. I work at them until I am exhausted, until my mind strains and prepares to break. But I solve them all. I break every complex bind that she can create. She starts easily, but the simple hexes are broken seconds after she weaves them. She soon understands that I am motivated by grand purpose, rather than rote practice. She swiftly escalates the difficulty, soon presenting opportunity for me to surpass what even she believed my potential was. My newfound resolve soon sends silent messages to those who once abused me. Perhaps they think me even more a freak than ever before, but I care little. They stay out of my way. I am free to do as I please. I still apply my talents to help others; Sapphire would not want me to neglect others for her sake. All that has changed is that my free time is no longer my own. Not a single second is wasted. Travel is spent in study instead of thought and wistful daydreams. Time of rest is spent in practice. Time I would cry over the pain that refuses to ebb is deferred; I can cry in my sleep, or I can cry when I'm dead.
</p><p class="journal">
	But every week, I return to the place. To the forest and the cabin. It remains abandoned at first, but eventually becomes my second home. Whomever once owned this cabin must have died or moved along. I immortalize my thanks to whomever it was in prayer. I never used to pray, but a divine encounter changes one's perspectives.
</p><p class="journal">
	Months pass. I eventually alienate myself from the people I once called friends. The other hexbreakers and outliers of the Eruzian healers were once the closest I had to siblings, and Mizara the closest I had to a mother. But after so long focused on one task, siblings become friends, who then become strangers. Mizara does not waver; she is always an exemplary mentor. But where I once relied on her for emotional support, spending nights sobbing into her arms for reasons I refused to disclose so as to not besmirch the name of those who are out to bring healing to the world, misguided by a perverted purity as they were, I now rely on her only for her guidance on healing and hexbreaking.
</p><p class="journal">
	And when my hexbreaking skills surpass even hers? I lose myself to isolation. I thank her for all she has done for me. I vow to carry on her work, to represent Eruzia for as long as I may live. She understands my purpose in life. She remains the only one who knows of my divine encounter. I do not use Sapphire's name, but I speak of the beauty that captured my heart. I speak of the curse whose very nature threatens the world with its insidious design. She accepts that to which I have devoted my life. She asks that if I should find peace before her time comes that I visit her again, and my promise to do just that remain our final parting words.
</p><p class="journal">
	Curses become my life. I seek out those that others declare cursed beyond help. Unbreakable becomes a word that challenges me, only to often disappoint. So often I used to see such thanks in the eyes of others after curing their curses. But now when the hexes prove paltry, so simple for my talents, I can see it in their eyes. Fear. I am not unkind. I smile. I assure people that I will cure them. But I am less personable. I am there to solve their puzzle. I wish to cure them, to heal them, to help them. But my goal drives me above all else. Their puzzles become my path to understanding. To fulfilling my promise to Sapphire. Worlds of once unknown magic are revealed to me. Magical scholars begin to travel great distances to speak with me, to probe my brain for the understanding I have achieved. Some come with offerings of magical texts concerning hexes, and I entertain them for a night, sometimes two. But my time does not afford teaching others altruistically. Soon, those with terrible hexes come to me. New puzzles, new understanding becomes mine.
</p><p class="journal">
	But with notoriety comes those who wish my downfall. Assassins seek me out. They are met with a master of magic they could not possibly anticipate. They fight with greed in their minds. A bounty on my head and no understanding of themselves or me. They are all doomed to fail before they arrive, and soon they come to see the boredom in my eyes as I defeat them with not a scratch upon me. The area around my cabin becomes a magical fortress, able to anticipate and intercept those who seek me. Soon, both assassins and those seeking help stop showing up. Tales of the great hexbreaker circulate, known to me only through scrying. Some say goddess, others say demon, others speak of great miracles that have nothing to do with me. I become a face to the tales of bards to attribute to whatever story they wish. I stop listening.
</p><p class="journal">
	Every week I continue to check. The place I nearly died becomes a regular spot for me to rest and think. The world has run out of things to teach me. Many, many books remain unread, but they all speak of magic so below me that it may be an active detriment to read. I practice artifice, fashioning a necklace for myself that is just as Sapphire's. A ruby, to match my eyes, just as hers. My many attempts to divine her, anything about her, fail. She is too far gone to know anything about. I hold out hope that this uncertainty contains the possibility of me seeing her again. 
</p><p class="journal">
	Isolation brings with it a great potential for dread. Invasive thoughts become more common. Lack of contact with others has left me with an emotional void. In times of great struggle I hold that feather that has not gathered a single spec of dirt, and I clutch it to my chest. It is my small reminder, my small sign that she might still be alive elsewhere, perhaps watching over me.
</p><p class="journal">
	I do not lose hope.
</p><p class="journal">
	I will not lose hope.
</p><p class="journal">
	And one year after Sapphire was lost to me on that fateful night, she once again returns to me.
</p><p class="journal">
~*~*~*~*
</p><p class="journal">
	I am in the forest from the night we met, scanning the sights of the snow-covered forest for things that have changed. A sparrow nest lay vacated in one of the trees. A burrow has been dug out by a fox and her kits not too far from where I once lay to die. I saw a deer briefly, but the skittish doe pranced away before long. People have been doing the same for a while now. Funny how power changes a person. But just as I'm resigned to turn back and return to my cabin, there is a bright flash before me.
</p><p class="journal">
	And there, where I had almost died, on her hands and knees, was Sapphire.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Sapphire!" I cry, voice breaking under the strain. My legs propel me forward upon my next heartbeat. And in my mind, the vision of a year ago today replays. I'm lunging forward, reaching for her. My fingers tingle. The world slows down, and I feel that either I will grab her now, or I will never again get the chance. I stumble, falling to my knees, but I am at her side now. My arms fall around her. I pull her close, lifting her up so she could lean against me, and I hold her. She is crying. She looks pale, she looks broken, barely able to move. I brush a hand through her hair, stroking it tenderly. "Shhh...Shhh...It's all right, Sapphire. I have you. I have you...I'm here now. I'm here to fix all of it.."
</p><p class="journal">
	The parallels that fate has drawn are not lost to me. So it is no surprise that my first instinct is to take her back to the cabin. A reversal of roles that is bittersweet; I never wished to be in a position where it was necessary to care for her like this. But at the same time, caring for her helps me show my love. It is second nature to me to care for her. She looks so weak, so frail, that I handle her seeking to emulate the tenderness that she possesses. I could not hope to, of course. But I can certainly try.
</p><p class="journal">
	"Gods how I've missed you," I say, vision blurry from tears. "Just rest for now. I'll take you somewhere warm."
</p><p class="journal">
	And I do. I raise her up like a bride, only able to stop the flood of giddy emotion at such a thing because she was unwell, and I carry her back to the cabin. She is not limp, but she is weak. She holds onto me as tightly as her shaking arms can, which redoubles my desire to make it right. She hasn't forgotten me. And when she can again speak, I know she will tell me she loves me. This is the time that I have been waiting for, training for. This is my moment.
</p><p class="journal">
	I get her into the cabin carefully, just as the snow picks up. Not overly windy, but the snow fell just as it did one year ago. Fate truly was hard at work on this day. I lay her in bed, and cover her with the thick blanket I'd acquired to get me through the soon approaching winter. It seems to soothe her. I take a seat at her bedside, on the very same chair she once sat upon looking over the bed at me. I get water for her, carefully letting her drink. She does, and seems thankful, but is weak nevertheless.
</p><p class="journal">
	I let her rest. She sleeps for a long while, exhausted by the tears no doubt. While she rests, I prepare to rid Sapphire of this curse once and for all. It requires careful study of the necklace and energies it radiates. Hours pass while I am at her bedside, carefully probing the energy. Two complimentary factors drive me: the most powerful and primary force is that my promise to Sapphire is about to be fulfilled, that I am going to heal her. Cure her. Love her. With any luck? Be able to hold her from this moment onward. Secondary is that I have never encountered such a complex curse, and it is as fascinating as it is terrifying. Who could envision something this terrible? Someone Sapphire was fighting, no doubt. She is likely to have many powerful evil enemies. But what they could not expect is that such a talented hexbreaker was waiting in her shadow for just a moment like this. The thought of these evil, faceless people snapping a staff over their knee in frustration, knowing their life's work of this curse was undone by some girl living in a cabin was a humorous one that helped keep my resolve even in the face of this behemoth of a curse.
</p><p class="journal">
	As I had thought, the hex would be most easily removed by simply transferring it. Unhooked from Sapphire's necklace, placed in this dummy necklace, and then destroyed. The destruction part might be somewhat hard, but it would be a bridge to cross when it came to that. I spend many hours preparing and plotting out the exact approach to use for this hex while Sapphire slumbers.
</p><p class="journal">
	When she wakes again, I'm still there with her. I rise, smiling at her, and lean over her to brush a hand over her forehead. "Hey, sleepy head," I call out in as gentle and playful a voice as I can. She manages a weak smile. "I've been waiting a year to remind you that I love you." I pause, smiling down at her. She doesn't seem to be able to talk, but she mouths it back. That was more than enough for me. I take one of her hands with both of mine. I squeeze gently. She curls her hands back around mine. "I'm going to heal you, Sapphire. Then we'll be both be able to say we've saved the other." She smiles again, wider this time. It swells my heart, and redoubles my resolve. I will do this. I will not fail. I will not falter.
</p><p class="journal">
	I set her hand down at her own side, then begin my work. She watches intently, but I'm far beyond performance anxiety. There would be plenty of room for that later. I have my necklace prepared, and am unattuned to it as one ought to be when dealing with curses, lest it latch onto me through the magical link. And of course I'm not wearing it. But it's nearby on the desk I had placed next to the bed. I intend to create a magical field around it after moving the curse, so as to contain it until I can destroy it. I close my eyes.
</p><p class="journal">
	The curse is woven with seven locks. Six on the radial points, one master lock in the middle that interlinks them. The weaving lines of interlocking magical ties are intricate and use a series of hooks that all pose as being the sort that cause harm upon removal. But in my studies I have come to know that no curse can be perfectly secured and anchored onto the soul of the victim. It subjects the curse to being corrupted by the spirit of the person, which in turn normalizes and neutralizes it. Even if there were steps made to isolate these hooks to prevent this, the hooks themselves become removable. Great care was put into this curse to make it appear to be dangerous to remove, but to me it is straight forward. It will require some time, but I am more focused than I have ever been in my life. I can figure out how to neutralize or destroy the curse later. Transferring curses was easier, and it meant that Sapphire would stop suffering now, rather than the months it would take me to figure out how to neutralize it without hurting her.
</p><p class="journal">
	And so I begin. I scour the layers upon layers upon layers of this curse, hands aglow with scarlet magic upon the necklace, and eyes closed to keep the mental image, the mental map of this curse drawn and burned into my mind. The first lock is unwoven in seconds. The second a minute later. Third in five minutes. Fourth at a half hour. I need to pause, then, and take a break to drink and recover my stamina. I wipe my brow with a damp cloth I prepared, and smile at Sapphire. She looks concerned. She was still crying. But I keep smiling, and dab at her sweating forehead with the same damp cloth. "Almost there, Sapphire. Just a little longer. Then you can rest easy."
</p><p class="journal">
	Enough rest. Back to it. Fifth lock removed a minute after restarting. Sixth, ten minutes later. The process is long, but progress is steady. The last lock interwove its tendrils into each of the other six. It was uncommon to see such deep protections on a hex at all; most could be effortlessly transferred and would easily float from person to person with just a small injection of mana. Most hexes were so simple that clinging to a host and being resistant to common spells like Remove Curse were not even in the realm of their existence. So many people just assume that hexes were all dispellable with that catch-all spell. A powerful spell, to be sure. But it only worked on those simple, rudimentary curses. The ones often applied to common magic items as one final laugh for the mage who created them to trick thieves or adventurers into thinking they've acquired something special, only to have it stuck to them while seeking the nearest decently adept spellcaster. Such a thing didn't remove the curse from the object itself, of course. No, that was far more complex. But it was a simple way to sever the attunement. Such a process would not work here on such a complex hex.
</p><p class="journal">
	What does work, of course, was my process of meticulously unraveling the obfuscated locks. Each of them had a key, metaphorically speaking, that unlocked them. In less sophisticated hexes this key could be picked my the magical probes of the one removing it; the aforementioned curse-breaking spell applied more of a warhammer to the situation than a set of thieves tools. But this curse? It had safeguards to counter such well known magics. It had its own set of keys to its unfoolable locks buried within its own woven magic. The keys were fragmented and hidden, but able to be pieced back together. I'd only encountered half a dozen such things towards the very end of my time with Mizara, and only a few more theoretical exercises thereafter. This was my first time undoing such a curse that had an actual negative effect tied to it. Its effect was also hidden, but that didn't matter. I don't care so much about the specifics; I know it's bad. I know it's hurting Sapphire. It will be destroyed soon anyway.
</p><p class="journal">
	This final lock has taken me an hour until now, and I'm only now getting its key pieced together. It's nearly ready to be moved. I am exhausted; this hex must have been made by Vecna himself to be so nefariously stuck. It reeks of deific levels of mana required to create it. So naturally, I fully intend to turn my nose up smugly to the universe when I remove it. Defy, rather than deify this hex! My body is drained. My mind aches. My head pounds. But my love for Sapphire drives me forward, until finally I feel that metaphorical click, and the mass of mana was ready to be removed. I open my eyes. I lift my hands from Sapphire's pendant, and smile weakly at her. I'd done it! She looks soothed, but still terrified. I don't exactly have time to ask her what was wrong. The hex is currently floating an inch above her pendant, held captive by my adept hands that still glowed with the steady flow of mana that produced that scarlet aura. There will be plenty of time to talk with Sapphire and ease those worried looks once I set the hex in the dummy necklace. I rise from my seat and slowly lower it into the ruby. Its hooks extend into the gem and bind to it just as I expected them to, though with a greater enthusiasm than anticipated. Curious.
</p><p class="journal">
	The necklace I had created begins to morph and contort from the mana infused into it. The simple silver chain turns black like wrought iron, and it produces spikes that protrude inward, forming a space just large enough for a human neck, give or take a half inch. I've contained the necklace in a sphere that will render it inert for now, until I can later deal with it.
</p><p class="journal">
	Or at least...I thought I had.
</p><p class="journal">
	With a burst of magic that defies logic, the necklace stimulated the weave while inside this inert sphere and shot its magical tendrils out to me. I was not attuned to this necklace. The necklace, however, attuned itself to me. I stumble backwards. The necklace's ruby turns black, swirling with the hex trapped inside until the red is drained for this dark void. It then vanishes, and then appears around my neck. And I get one last look at Sapphire who is holding their hand out to me, reaching out to me, unable to do anything to stop me as I unknowingly seal my own fate and discover finally what had caused Sapphire to scream that terrible scream one year ago tonight. And when I do? I am no longer looking at her. I am looking past her. Far, far past her. A thousand miles past her, into the black void that consumes my vision.
</p><p class="journal">
	I do not know what happens next. All I feel is the weight of the world crash onto my shoulders. The love for Sapphire, the respect and kindness I feel for Mizara, the years of my life that were happy and were sad and were triumphant and were failures all fade to nothingness.
</p><p class="journal">
	I feel it.
</p><p class="journal">
	I feel it all.
</p><p class="journal">
	I hear their screams.
</p><p class="journal">
	I feel their pain.
</p><p class="journal">
	Their anguish.
</p><p class="journal">
	Their hopelessness.
</p><p class="journal">
	Their suffering.
</p><p class="journal">
	Suffering.
</p><p class="journal">
	So...So much suffering...
</p><p class="journal">
	Every scream. Every tear. Every sob. Every trembling muscle that leaked its sanguine vital force.
</p><p class="journal">
	The deluge of blood I had once dreamed of returns to my mind. But this deluge that once drowned me was a single drop of rain now. What buries me, drowns me, is a thick, putrid, vile, black tar. It floods around me and scolds my skin and my mind. It leaks from my eyes and from my lips and ears and nose. I scream, but it only gurgles disgusting bubbles. A single beat of my heart is all it takes for this tar, in volumes that exceed the oceans of the world, to condemn me to the depths, standing on the ocean floor of tar so black and so deep that light is erased not only from my sight but from my mind. I cannot speak. I cannot think. I cannot cry. I am so far retreated in the recesses of my mind that I will never again emerge. I am lost. My vision is black. My mind is filled with the images of those who are dying, those who are raped, those who are trapped and those who are lost and those who die and bleed and cry and burn.
</p><p class="journal">
	I see children abused by mothers and fathers. I feel the blows against my bruised cheeks and broken nose.
</p><p class="journal">
	I see innocent women raped.
</p><p class="journal">
	I see the chasm of the valley below. I feel the wind rushing through my hair as I jump off, and feel my neck break on impact...But it does not free me of the lifetime of abuse and descent into darkness that brought me to that cliff's edge. Death would be too merciful.
</p><p class="journal">
	I see the view of my home, walking in to find all my valuables taken. I rush up the stairs to see my husband and child with their throats slit. Everything I held dear taken from me, I feel the warm hardwood on my knees as I descend to it, sobbing. I find a knife and finish myself off, laying myself on my dead husband while clutching my dead infant son.
</p><p class="journal">
	I feel no hope. There is not enough time in this universe for me to traverse upward. I descend lower, and the suffering worsens. Resistance does nothing. I feel all the suffering of all these people who I know to be very real people and I watch them die, I watch them suffer, I live with them for the hours and hours and hours and hours they sob and cry in isolation. And I know I cannot help them. The moment I could travel to save a single person, if they might still be alive, I would feel the suffering and deaths of a trillion others. I feel this suffering from people not of this world. Of people in other planes of existence. It opens my eyes to the multiverse and broadens my understanding and my power, and uses that power to magnify my own suffering by magnitudes beyond the realm of comprehension.
</p><p class="journal">
	And then I am back in the cabin. A single second had passed. My heart beats again, and the pain surges through me. I cannot look at Sapphire now. I scramble through my belongings in the drawers of my desk and produce a dagger. I promised Sapphire I would never let her suffer this curse. I promised. And so I must destroy it. 
</p><p class="journal">
	I must destroy myself. 
</p><p class="journal">
	I drag the dagger across my throat without hesitation. I'd done so a thousand times in my mind while finding this dagger, so my mind feels no fear. The cold iron splits my skin and I feel the shock of pain shoot up into me. I try to scream, but air simply gurgles out of my cut throat. I fall forward, into my desk, then backwards onto my back. I stare up at the ceiling, waiting for death to embrace me. I refuse to look at Sapphire. I cannot imagine the anguish I have imparted upon her for forcing her to witness this.
</p><p class="journal">
	I wait for death.

</p><p class="journal">
	I have not drawn breath in almost an hour, yet death still does not come.
</p><p class="journal">
	I cannot stand. I can only look over at Sapphire now, overcome with regret. I had thought I could run away. But my death does not come so easily. I see Sapphire reaching out to me, weak and unable to move from the bed. I see her tears. And the sight is the only thing that makes me yearn for death more than this curse.
</p><p class="journal">
	I've done this.
</p><p class="journal">
	I've hurt her.
</p><p class="journal">
	I've caused these tears.
</p><p class="journal">
	I only wanted to help.
</p><p class="journal">
	I only wanted to cure you, Sapphire.
</p><p class="journal">
	I only wanted to make you smile. To love you. To hold you.
</p><p class="journal">
	I never wanted this to happen.
</p><p class="journal">
	I'm sorry.
</p><p class="journal">
	But I made a promise.
</p><p class="journal">
	I won't let you bear this curse.
</p><p class="journal">
	So it is with strength that this curse forces me to regain that I stand. My throat burns with pain but it has been repaired, and I can again breathe. I dash out of the cabin, vowing to not look back.
</p><p class="journal">
	I weep endlessly as I run into the snow-covered forest.
</p><p class="journal">
	I am no longer able to face Sapphire. All I know is suffering. I cannot help her now. I cannot let her try and reverse what I have done. My mortal mind cannot survive this suffering.
</p><p class="journal">
	I will disappear into the forest.
</p><p class="journal">
	I will seek death.
</p><p class="journal">
	I will destroy myself and take this curse with me, so that Sapphire may live free of it eternally.

	Death eludes me for years thereafter. I returned to the cabin after five years to find it abandoned and crumbling. My mind still warps and twists with this suffering I live through each day. Sleep does not exist for me. Only unconscious continuation of the nightmares of my waking mind, made all the more vivid by the lack of waking stimuli.
</p><p class="journal">
	I have resigned to my fate of eternal life. I can feel that I do not age. I have attempted increasingly creative and magical ways to end my life, but I cannot. I only suffer through the pain of it, blended together with the suffering of the multiverse that suffuses me.
</p><p class="journal">
	My perspective on the world shifts. I think deeply on it as suffering becomes normal for me. I conclude that there exists only one sort of being that could cure me, or could have cured Sapphire.
</p><p class="journal">
	The Gods.
</p><p class="journal">
	But they do not.
</p><p class="journal">
	They will not.
</p><p class="journal">
	Our suffering is not worth their concern.
</p><p class="journal">
	I cannot face Eruzia now. I am too far gone.
</p><p class="journal">
	Twenty more years pass; I wander. I observe the world around me, bearing the mark of Eruzia only because I continue to seek to erase suffering I find from the world. I continue to heal. To break curses. The necklace gives me power I had never known. I attempt to break my own curse many times. I conclude that I cannot each time, but find ways to try again with misguided resolve. I observe the remnants of my previous life through divination. I learn of Mizara's death, and I visit her grave.
</p><p class="journal">
	I surprise myself with how much I cry. I had thought myself numb to emotional pain. It is my own fault that I did not see her again before her passing.
</p><p class="journal">
	I leave flowers on her grave each year.
</p><p class="journal">
	At some point, the bards began to tell tales of me again. Not of Eruzia, not of the great hexbreaker, not of Valentina.
</p><p class="journal">
	No, I have scared people with my power for a long time now; these are foreboding omens, stories of caution of a cursed figure that wanders the world.
</p><p class="journal">
	The world no longer knows Valentina.
</p><p class="journal">
	The world now knows of the Black Diamond.</p>
