    My name is Xannus Ithikarion. I am a master of invisibility. Of illusory magic that bends light so I cannot be seen. I have few equals. Fewer still who have not succumbed to the sands of time. I am not seen until such time that I desire to be so. For this, I have come to be known as Xannus the Clear. That is all you must know of me to read this journal.

    I write this journal to set into records of history my experiences. This is my fourth. I will fill each journal before I begin another, be it with written word, cartography, or inscription of magic. A memory stone may falter in time. Oral history can be lost as memories fade and obscure. A written word, well-preserved, re-recorded with legibility and attention to accuracy, can last forever. Such is a philosophy I have come to adopt from my readings of Myst, and its creator, its progenitor: The Wizard of Myst. I have known a great many persons in my life. I would like to have known the Wizard of Myst, had I lived when he did so. But by estimates, a thousand or so years separate us. That mastery of magic could remedy wrongs beyond the scope of imagination. One can only speculate, then, that he ascribed to a philosophy that put the trust in the future, not in himself. For a hero who rights wrongs by hand will create a golden age around him so long as he lives, and spell the opening for evil to rise up more powerful than ever when he passes. A wisdom I carry with me from my dearest friend [ Transcriber's note: The name here is missing, as a hole about the size of an iron arrowhead is punched through the paper of the original journal; the damage to subsequent pages was able to be mended ]. To see the bigger picture encompassing the entire multiverse beyond the scope of your own life, and perhaps even sacrificing your own life to make it a reality...Yes, that is a man with whom I would give anything to sit with for a few hours over tea and simply talk. I do not disparage those who do good, of course. I do not believe it is wrong to stand against evil. On the contrary, we must. We all must. But in a multiverse where evil always will be, unless perhaps such time comes that the Nine Hells are cleansed, the infinite battles of Acheron ceased, the Abyss finally charted in its totality and brought to order and its evil roots banished, the Tarterian Depths of Carceri tamed...Hah. No. Even in the realms of a thought experiment, it is absurd. Evil always will be. So too, must good. And to empower good, one must do more than simply be good. One must inspire. One must create realities that impede evils. Where children do not become orphans, where lords have check and balance to ensure greed does not capture them. Where the common folk may learn, unimpeded by the circumstance of their birth. Lofty goals, each in their own. And yet, The Wizard of Myst decided that a lofty goal of bringing knowledge to the multiverse was not out of his grasp. It is my hope, then, that my journals end up in the archives of Myst, so they might live on. I reflect on this as I read through my previous three journals and recall my time spent in Aetheria, in Faerun, and most recently Eizendel.

    Do not go to Eizendel. Not unless you are a being driven purely by carnal instinct, or are a fool like me who thought they could tame the Wild Winds.

    Now, this journal will recollect my memories from my home. From Gurhal. I return here after a long time away, to stay, hopefully. The Moon plane has prospered in my absence, but the Star plane, and in particular, Hotenz city, has truly seen the most fruitful advance. It is a place that would make Eberron green with envy the plane round. But the materials to produce things such as the Linear Line and teleportation network and its staunch defenses are, so are the claims at least, too expensive, too difficult to mass produce to share this wealth with the rest of the planes, or even the other nearly major settlements. Hotenz was the last surviving bastion in the war against the Dark Curtain, where Silent Purity descended from the heavens to drive back the legions of Faust. But one must wonder, is that truth simply being leveraged, like a tough, iron crowbar, to give justification to greed? It has been nigh on a thousand years since Faust was slain. What purpose does the fortress city of Hotenz now serve? Is there concern that another great evil will rise? Perhaps. Such is wisdom that she has shared with me before, indeed. Such is why she entrusted the star to me, to bring away from Gurhal to Aetheria. Alas, I lost the star there. The bastard Shadowsworn couldn't shake his gambling addiction, couldn't stop until the high of his wagers included that of his own wife and son. I've sought long and hard for it, trying to trace where it has gone, but the damnable Shadowsworn lands are a death sentence to traverse. Many night I've had to slip into civilian homes under veil of my invisibility and avoid making a single noise until the grey sun rose again. Perhaps Rythern now possesses the star? Hah, not like she'd tell anyone even if she did.

    But it is a great regret of mine. She always did say that her star was what she treasured most of all. I'm sure she meant only of objects, naturally. For there's little in life I'm sure she treasured as much as her sparrow. The two of them had a love that was easy to admire, truly. This old man's heart once wished to have her looking upon me the way she looked upon her lover. But losing the star was certainly as much proof as I'd ever need that I didn't deserve her. She undoubtedly saw it. Saw my adoration of her. But we were to remain friends. For the best. I don't know that I could ever indulge in such happiness with someone who could see through my shield of invisibility. I like my privacy. And damned if her eyes pierced ever veil I could place on myself. Never seemed to bother her sparrow, of course. A wise friend she will always be.

    Why do I ramble on about this for so long? Well. Because among the conversations we've had about auras and emotion and what love and fear and all these other things mean as she sits and sips her tea likely enjoying how I fumble and try to put to words that which is more easily felt than explained, it allows me to put forward a contribution to the world. A nugget of truth, of her wisdom. I have discussed this at length in prior journals, but I will repeat it in summation here:
  </p>
  <p class="journal">
    Auras. That is what she called them. They suffuse all living things. People, plants, animals, everything. Everything that lives has an aura. Even the undead, I'm told, have something like that, though it's apparently different. Don't disparage me for not being able to explain clearly: this magic resists explanation. It only can be felt to be understood. Words can carry half-measures to understanding, and surely are part of understanding it, but you cannot, I emphasize: Can. Not. Understand this magic with text alone. If you are a wizard reading this, I am wholeheartedly sorry. You may just bash your forehead against this text in frustration.
  </p>
  <p class="journal">
    These auras, they are connected, somehow, to the soul. She has told me before that echoes of the soul exist even in the soulless. Undead who have souls suffused in them bear more typical auras. Those that are but animated bones bear but fragments, imitations of it. Inanimate objects of course don't have auras. But these auras are fed by emotion, similarly to how a Sorcerer might empower their spells when a hot-headed pyromancer surges with anger to produce hotter flames. But this discipline of magic, this auramancy, is far more potent it its connection to emotion. She imparted on me many truths of how this auramancy works, but the summation of it is paradoxically that it is at its most powerful when it is calm, and when it is out of control. On these extremes, it is magic that could make even the masters of Netheril quake, for a true master of the art.

    She meditated a lot. It helped to keep her calm. No amount of goading or emotional manipulation could break her. She was a master. Yet, I recall a time that a djinn saw fit to anger her, doing so was no small feat I may add. To test her passive, peaceful nature. (Why can't people just leave well enough alone? They see someone committed to peace and their first thought is how might I bother them until I prove they are just as violent as I am inside? What emotional insecurity leads them to this?) Ultimately, she didn't harm the djinn. But perhaps she saw that the djinn needed to be shown what fate awaited them? Regardless, I saw her aura then, a flare of red all around her. It then brightened and shimmered with a trillion colours colliding and reflecting off one another. And she flung four spears of this chromatic light, barely missing the djinn each time, to embed in the wall behind him. Then, she held a fifth spear of chromatic light out, the tip touching his neck. Have you ever seen a djinn turn entirely pale? Entirely white as snow from face to smoking tail? I have.
  </p>
  <p class="journal">
    I asked her: What brings about this power? How can emotion be so empowering? She had to say, in my own words: Emotion is a manifestation of our core self. It is an expression of that which we hold most true. In part, guided by logic. In whole, guided by soul. Perception and understanding influence emotion, but emotion is the raw power to then be sculpted by logic, by reason. When emotion is calm, it is easily guided. It can be used much like wizardry. Careful control of how mana flows through one's self. But when emotion burns brightly, when it is explosive in its strength? That, too can be conferred through the auramancer. Wild and untamed, the emotion blooms outwards. It is such that an auramancer is, perhaps, more powerful not when they themselves are threatened, but when someone has the poor presence of mind to threaten someone they care about. You see, the aura carries emotion. Auramancers can see the aura, ergo, they can see emotion, can feel it through a mystical empathy. So may all the gods above help you if you hurt someone they care deeply about. Their propensity to calm keeps them from lashing out over everything, of course. It still takes a lot to evoke this sort of power. But should anyone threaten her little sparrow, she has told me? Well. She had colourful language to speak that I dare never imagined would come from her mouth. Truly merciless fire burned in her for any who threatened her sparrow. She loved her sparrow, of course. That is why the emotion burned so bright. The sort of love that one needn't be an auramancer to see clearly. The doe-eyed looks she gave them...Enough to make an old man jealous.
  </p>
  <p class="journal">
    But therein lay truth about this power. It had tenets, like all magic. It borrowed some from the monastic traditions of monks, some from the divine strength of paladins and clerics, some from the wild emotion of sorcerers, some from the arcane control of wizards, some from the natural connection of druids...You can see how this shows great versatility. Yet, this truth is thus: it did not blossom from hate, like the callous rage of a barbarian. It blossomed from love and compassion. Paradoxically, it granted the greatest power for purposes it never was meant to be used to perform. She told me that novice auramancers struggle greatly to use their powers offensively. That it takes great discipline and emotional fortitude to will this power to strike down a foe. Perhaps goes a great length to explain why all the auramancers have died...Ah, my mouth tastes of ash and acrid poison even as I write that. It is hard to deny the desire to preserve the innocence. But this world is a cruel one.
  </p>
  <p class="journal">
    And beyond this weakness lay another, perhaps greater one: she spoke of how dissonance in the aura could make an auramancer ill. She tells me that when auramancy is harnessed, the auramancer becomes immune to poison, immune to diseases, to illness, gods even to sweating! She called it the 'purity of self'. Something that an auramancer must maintain to harness their power. They never get sick, their clothes always sparkle, they accept and embrace others with open arms, they are such beings of peace and passivity that deer and woodland critters and birds will congregate near them, perch on them, like they would do to a druid. But when something breaks that purity of self, they can fall ill. That break stems from emotions they let poison them. She called it poison. What does that even mean? Poison emotions? This is what I mean. I write this, and I re-read what I wrote, and I don't even know what it is I'm saying anymore! I could have lived a much simpler life, you know, had I just instead worked in service of the court of king Ivyr. But that would require, among other things, the ability to travel through time, wouldn't it? Maybe she and her sparrow will come dine with me there again, at the castle, assuming its spectral servants still remain. Ever-loyal to the long-dead nobility, that not even death co--
