  <h1>DOAA Asset Brief and FAQ</h1>
  <h2>Applicable to: DOAA Assets</h2>
  <p>Welcome.</p>
  <p>Please familiarize yourself with your DOAA agent tablet. It has been set up to recognize your biometrics; any other attempted access will immediately lockdown this tablet and erase all contents on the device, including immediate destruction of the storage device located on the tablet. Your tablet also is equipped with a magical countermeasure which will prevent other entities from viewing the contents of your tablet; it will appear as a blank white screen to all other entities who do not possess your unique biometric and magical signature. As a DOAA Asset, you cannot disable this countermeasure, as that function requires authorization as a member of DOAA Personnel.</p>
  
  <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
  
  <h2><i>What is the DOAA?</i></h2>
  
  <p>DOAA stands for Deniable Operations and Assassinations Agency. It is a secret agency operating with complete deniability to the United States government; the acronym DOAA may appear on official documents and has an established cover for its authority within the US judicial and executive systems. As the name implies, the use of lethal force is part of many DOAA agents' tasks. </p>
  
  <h2><i>Why is everything so secret?</i></h2>
  
  <p>Secrecy is paramount to the DOAA to maintain deniability in all aspects of operations. Such operations often entail dealing with entities which would shatter the foundations of normal human lives if revealed, and lead to states of global panic, chaos, and anarchy. Stability, security, and safety of the general public remain the top priorities of the DOAA.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What happens if information leaks?</i></h2>
  
  <p>Any and all information leaks are addressed according to protocol, including excommunication of all individuals involved in the leak, and Redmarking of any individuals considered actively hostile to the DOAA or its objectives, followed be established deniability protocols to erase all traces of compromising information.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What does 'DOAA Asset' mean?</i></h2>
  
  <p>See the 'Entity Classifications' document for full details. DOAA Assets are considered valuable to the DOAA for knowledge and/or skills and thus are cooperated with to achieve objectives.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What if I lose my tablet?</i></h2>
  
  <p>Tablets are set to render themselves inoperable if any unathorized access is attempted. Such tablets will emit a magical beacon alerting recovery teams to recover the tablet if unauthorized access is attempted. A new tablet can be requested via your handler.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What is a 'dead drop'?</i></h2>
  
  <p>A dead drop is your primary method of communication with your handler. You should avoid being seen in person with your handler whenever possible, and only in secured locations when doing so. A dead drop consists of an agreed upon location that is secure or inconspicuous enough that you will not raise suspicion in interacting with it. Specific examples include safety deposit boxes or mailboxes. In such places, you will place documents of interest or written requests which will be retrieved by your handler, and a response if needed will come in the most appropriate manner, typically dead-dropping the needed materials or communications.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What are 'self destructive mediums' (SDMs)?</i></h2>
  
  <p>SDMs are the DOAA's materials which are set to destroy themselves once they are no longer needed. Such examples include a folder of enchanted papers that will burn themselves with non-destructive flames and turn to ash instantly after a set period of time once the folder is opened, typically 24 hours, or cassette tapes which will destroy their internal recording after being played or stopped mid-play.</p>
  
  <p>Because of the potential for leaks in the use of SDMs, the DOAA has moved to using personal tablets whenever possible, as tablets are set to receive satellite signals to download data; these signals and downloaded instructions are the only way to write data to a tablet, so the device cannot be compromised, and cannot be viewed by anyone except the authorized user under normal circumstances.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What is an MTF?</i></h2>
  
  <p>An MTF is a Mobile Task Force. Most DOAA agents work alone, but may be formed into MTF groups to achieve specific objectives. Other agents are part of permanent MTFs, and are kept on standby to respond rapidly to emergency circumstances.</p>
  
  <h2><i>What is an INU?</i></h2>
  
  <p>INU stands for Immediate Neutralization Unit. INUs are specialized task forces that do not have active objectives, as when an INU response is called, their purpose is to immediately teleport to the necessary location and act to neutralize their targeted threat. INUs are kept in reserve to respond to Class X and Class XI magical threats. They can only be dispatched by DOAA central command.

  <h1>Classification of Magical Threats</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>DOAA classification for magic items and users (referred to as 'entities') is defined with the purpose of evaluation of threat to general population and ability to affect existing forces of law, order, and stability. Classification may fluctuate as new information is learned about an entity. Classifications are written with flexibility in guidelines to cover as much of the spectrum of magic as possible.</p>
  
  <p>Note that threat levels and potentials do not necessarily reflect that of the entity in question specifically; if an entity is capable of creating or summoning other entities with the capacity for destruction appropriate to a specific class, the base entity is also given this classification to reflect the potential threat of the entity in question.</p>
  
  <p>Also note: while each class has recommendations for dealing with hostile entities of each class, these are assumed to be in a 'no-negotiation' situation, where de-escalation tactics are not possible. Threat levels are weighted based on an entity's magical influence; supernatural abilities are also considered as part of this classification system. Specific threat level designations are listed relative to the DOAA and by extension humanity as a whole, not to any individual. As such, it should be noted that even Class I entities can be a significant danger to non-magical personnel.</p>
  
  <h2>Class 0</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Negligible</p>
  
  <p>Description: No magical potential.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Normal protocols. Killing unauthorized unless in exigent circumstance or under kill order.</p>
  
  <h2>Class I</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Negligible</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class I magic applies to entities which exhibit minimal magical potential. Examples of such include apprenticing magi, or low-energy artifacts.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: No special action or threat recommendations. Handle with discretion. Killing is not authorized without specific kill orders or unless under exigent circumstances.</p>
  
  <h2>Class II</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Minimal</p>
  
  <p>Class II magic covers general use magic capable of causing notable harm or boons upon other entities. Examples include low-potential magi capable of conjuring basic spells such as <i>Firebolt</i>.
    
    <p>In the event of hostility: No special action or threat recommendations. Handle with discretion. Killing authorized only if entity cannot be subdued with non-lethal means. </p>
  
  <h2>Class III</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Minor </p>
  
  <p>Description: Class III entites are entities that specialize in specific magic, ascending past general use magic to make use of specifically tailored effects that combined with other talents for users can make them moderately dangerous if turned enemy.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Exercise heightened caution when handling, as entity may have traps or safeguards. Killing authorized only if entity cannot be subdued with non-lethal means.</p>
  
  <h2>Class IV</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Minor</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class IV entites have specific training and abilities that make them a significant threat even in the face of military level response, and all entities Class IV and above should be treated with extreme caution.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Neutralize if possible; seek advantageous engagement opportunities.</p>
  
  <h2>Class V</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Moderate </p>
  
  <p>Description: Class V entites pose potential threat to entire city populations, and often have highly specialized sets of magical abilities and other skills that allow them to be difficult to track down and/or kill.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Neutralize if possible. Follow counter-magic training strictly. Alert other DOAA assets to the threat as soon as possible.</p>
  
  <h2>Class VI</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Moderate</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class VI entities possess potential to cause destruction of multiple cities, up to small countries, or have power that makes them equivalently dangerous to other Class V or below individuals. While dangerous, these entities are often capable of being neutralized by DOAA task forces with minor casualties.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Engage if probability of success is high. Follow standard protocol to request Mobile Task Forces (MTFs) if required; all entities Class VI and above are valid targets for MTF requisition.</p>
  
  <h2>Class VII</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Moderate</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class VII entities exhibit potential to cause destruction or chaos on a scale that encompasses the entire continental United States on their upper bound. Most Class VII entities are below this threshold, but may have other powers or abilities that make them extraordinarily dangerous.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Engage only if probability of success is high. Dis-engagement recommended unless overwhelming advantage present.</p>
  
  <h2>Class VIII</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: High</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class VIII entities are entities of strong magical potential, encompassing accomplished magic users and magical items and artifacts of high rarity. Threat capacity may extend up to destruction on a continental scale, but typically is limited below this threshold.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Engage if probability of success is high. Employ any and all counter-magic tactics to ensure target neutralization. Disengagement and re-engagement with appropriate reinforcements is recommended.</p>
  
  <h2>Class IX</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: High</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class IX entities approach the apex of typical magical potentials, and are often extremely powerful magic users, sentient magical items, or artifacts of immense power. Threat capacity is at least continental scale.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Class IX entities should not be engaged without appropriate support. Follow established protocols to alert to a Class IX level threat as soon as possible and follow orders relayed.</p>
  
  <h2>Class X</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Severe</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class X entities generally encompass what is understood to be the typical apex of magical potential, allowing magic users to perform such feats as the <i>Prismatic Wall</i> or <i>Power Word: Kill</i> spells and beyond. Such entities are also often capable of producing Class IX magical artifacts. Threat capacity extends up to destruction on a global scale.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Engage only if success is highly probable, as such entities are often extremely intelligent and have layers of contingency. Follow protocal to request Immediate Neutralization Unit (INU) response.</p>
  
  <h2>Class XI</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Extreme</p>
  
  <p>Description: Class XI entites exhibit extraordinary magical potential which allow them to affect entire planes of existence, being able to wipe out an entire plane of existence including the Material Plane* and as such should be neutralized at all costs if deemed hostile. Class XI magic users are often responsible for the creation of the most powerful magical artifacts in existence. Threat potential is not measurable.</p>    
    
    <p>*<i>Clarification: The 'Material Plane' is the magical academic reference to the universe in which humanity lives, which is distinct from the 'border planes', 'outer planes', and 'parrallel planes'.</i> </p>
      
      <p>In the event of hostility: Neutralize at all costs. Do not engage without overwhelming advantage. Engage direct superior via established contact protocols as soon as possible after threat is observed to alert DOAA central command to a XK-Class End of the World threat.</p>
  
  <h2>Class XII</h2>
  
  <p>Threat level: Existential</p>
  
  <p>Description: Sometimes referred to as 'Midnight', in reference to the <i>Doomsday Clock</i>, a Class XII entity is applied only to entities that are beyond all capacity to neutralize. Such entities are ones capable of affecting the nature of reality itself, and may be capable of ending all existence on a whim. This classification should be reserved for entities with no known countermeasures, and are beyond the DOAA's capacity to stop. Threat capacity is beyond comprehension.</p>
  
  <p>Note the distinction remains that a Class XII entity may not be at all hostile, and may even be allied to the DOAA, but their capacity for alteration or destruction of the very fabric of reality is what designates an entity with this class.</p>
  
  <p>In the event of hostility: Pray.</p>

<div class="content" id="entities">
  <h1>Classification of Entity Hostility</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Target classification is intended on allowing agents to understand how to approach an entity, as well as how much information should be divulged to the entity. Multiple classifications can be applied to a single entity.</p>
  
  <h2>DOAA Personnel</h2>
  <p>Descripton: Any entity tagged as DOAA Personnel may be spoken to about DOAA business freely, while ensuring all channels of communication are encrypted, and discussions are kept secret.</p>
  
  <h2>DOAA Asset</h2>
  
  <p>Description: Entites tagged as DOAA Assets are aware of the DOAA and operations relevant to their function within the DOAA. DOAA Assets should have their scope confirmed before divulging information, and all other information should be treated as classified. </p>
  
  <h2>Non-sentient </h2>
  
  <p>Description: Classification applies to all non-sentient entites, but which might be cursed, programmed, or otherwise controlled within a set of mechanical parameters that do not exhibit sentience or free will. </p>
  
  <h2>Safe </h2>
  
  <p>Description: Entites tagged as Safe include law-abiding citizens who are not persons of interest or otherwise expected to be dangerous. It should be assumed that Safe entities do not know of the DOAA, and standard protocols should be employed to avoid suspicion.</p>
  
  <h2>Hostile </h2>
  
  <p>Description: Entities tagged as hostile should not be approached or engaged unless necessary; Hostile entities should be observed and their actions and whereabouts logged and submitted if encountered. Hostile entities may or may not be aware of the DOAA. Hostile entities should be presumed dangerous and likely to use lethal force.</p>
  
  <h2>Neutral </h2>
  
  <p>Description: Entites tagged as neutral are believed to be without specific hostility to the DOAA, whether aware of its existence or not, but otherwise possess the capacity to change to either Hostile or Ally in the future based on their actions due to their magical potential. </p>
  
  <h2>Ally </h2>
  
  <p>Description: Entites tagged as Ally are entities which fight for the same greater good as the DOAA, and can generally be expected to fight against Hostile entities if able, or otherwise act selflessly. Entities tagged as Ally must also either not be aware of the DOAA or be literally allied with the DOAA, such as a former DOAA Asset who has been excommunicated.</p>
  
  <h2>Redmarked </h2>
  
  <p>Description: Enties tagged as Redmarked are kill-on-sight, and include individuals who present an information leak risk to the DOAA, ex-DOAA personnel who are believed to be disloyal to the DOAA, but is most commonly applied to kill targets, or targets who are likely to also act with a kill-on-sight operational attitude.</p>

    <h1>"Willow"</h1>
  <h2>Known Statistics:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Presumed Female</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Classifications:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Class V Magic User</li>
    <li>Hostile</li>
    <li>Redmarked</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Brief</h2>
  <p>Entity known only as "Willow" is described as an extremely hostile and dangerous entity. Class V magic is applied primarily to stealth efforts. Details are still being investigated on this entity to ascertain if Willow is their true name, and if so if they have a last name and/or if any forensic evidence of the entity can be acquired for study. No currently known descriptions or vital statistics are gathered for this individual, as they clearly employ magical countermeasures to ensure they do not leave any traces of their presence; their efforts have been attributed to the events of ████████ and █████████.</p>
  
  <h2>Operational Objectives</h2>
  
  <p>Subject has been Redmarked on authority of ███████████. As such, a standing kill-on-sight order is in place. Agents are encouraged to subdue the target if and only if they have 100% certainty of success, as subject has been described as having unstable persona by DOAA asset ████████████████. </p>
  
  <p>If not directly confronted by entity, collection of biological material is to be considered next highest priority to compare against DOAA records.</p>
  
  <p>The use of anti-invisibility flares and/or anti-invisibility floodlights is to be employed at all times whenever securing a location suspected of being a target of the entity. Teleportation anchors are to be deployed to any high-risk locations prepared to combat the entity. 
  
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  
  <p>Special note by ███████████, the scent of blood on the air through magical means is suggested to be entity's method of alerting others to their presence. It is unkown if this is involuntary or not.</p>
