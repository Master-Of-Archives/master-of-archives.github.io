<h2>
  The First Crusaders
  </h2>
  
  <p>Legends speak of the creation of Myst, of how the Wizard of Myst summoned his unfathomable power to create the realm itself. Following its creation, legends speak of a band of adventurers. Adventurers whose goal it was to seek the secrets of the multiverse. To explore the unexplored. To find tomes of lost knowledge. To find artifacts of grand power. They were the First Crusaders. A band of adventurers whose sole purpose in founding Myst was to venture out and begin the unparalleled collection that now exists today. With time, the original First Crusaders succumbed. But as each member fell, it was decided that another would replace them and maintain the mission of the First Crusaders.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>The tradition continues to the modern day. The First Crusaders are a band of adventurers whose purpose is to seek the unknown, to acquire the treasures and mysteries of the multiverse. To aide in this, the leader of the First Crusaders guild must always be a member of the Followers of Myst who is a member of the Closed Circuit - the trusted circle of guild members who have proven themselves worthy of access to the secrets of knowledge most dangerous - to ensure they fully grasp the gravity of the missions they undertake, and to ensure the powerful things they retrieve will be returned to Myst.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>While the members of the First Crusaders need not necessarily be individually the strongest, smartest, most agile or most powerful, the members all must work together to achieve their missions, and in that camaraderie comes strength. These missions can be as short as a few weeks, or as long as years on end. It is common that they will find themselves juggling the acquisition of multiple targets of interest at any given time. They may find themselves working all together as one cohesive unit, or segregated into teams where required. Many past members of the First Crusaders later go on to join other groups within the Followers of Myst. Others remain in the First Crusaders until death; death remains a very real possibility, as the missions the First Crusaders undertake can see them travelling to inhospitable places, deadly dungeons, and areas with active conflict or political unrest. After all, if the treasures they sought were so easily obtained, they would be snatched up far before the First Crusaders could acquire them. The deadly trials they face together act as a sobering induction into adventuring life, and when planes apart from home, they can only rely on each other to survive.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The captain of the First Crusaders is chosen by the administrators of the Followers of Myst; they must be able to gain admittance into the Closed Circuit if they are not already a member of it. The captain is then able to select the others in the group. People may apply specifically, or may be approached to join. For some, the position is a way to broaden their skills, as the group very regularly sees adventure for long periods of time. For others, it is a stepping stone in their path to other places within the guild. While in the immediate generations that followed the original First Crusaders, the group maintained exclusivity to elite members, that tradition has over time shifted to be more welcoming of any adventurer, so long as they understand what they are getting themselves into. Like with the Followers of Myst as a whole, the group itself benefits from the adventurers being able to learn from one another.
  </p>
  
  <p>In recent history, Myst received the grim news that the existing First Crusaders were all slain in battle with no survivors; their arcanist was only able to, with his final message, make use of a Sending Stone to relay to his fate to the administrators of the Followers of Myst with the words: "We have failed. I'm sorry.". In light of this, the tradition has continued with the appointment of a new captain and new members. Below, you'll find the current members of the First Crusaders, and their respective specialties.

  <h3>
    Amara Sunsong
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Captain, Paladin, Healer
  </h4>
    
    <p>Amara Sunsong, the current captain of the First Crusaders, remains somewhat closed off about her history. She is a friendly person overall, but tends to avoid talking about herself. She came to become the captain of the First Crusaders, following the tragic loss of the previous members, after a number of years in the Followers of Myst. During this time, she earned the respect of her peers by showcasing a selfless attitude, a very keen tactical mind, and a strength in leadership on top of her competent skill in martial combat, showing particular skill with polearms. She holds no delusions about the dangers she faces, and her responsibility to her allies to see that history does not repeat itself. She wields light-attuned magic, and she has been described as having a natural gift for all light-based magic, while struggling with most other forms of magic. This magic manifests in her ability to heal, as well as perform a versatile array of offensive spells, as well as suffuse herself with auras which bolster her allies.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of combat, she is generally a tender and kind person. She strives to earn the respect of those around her and gain their trust through friendship and loyalty. She looks out for her friends, and is known to be an excellent cook. She is a thoughtful, observant person who presents with a great degree of emotional maturity. This has allowed her to be well-regarded as a good fit for her position, and this contributes to having brought some measure of renown to the current First Crusaders, where past generations may have proven more forgettable. </p>

  <h3>
    Amelia Wysperwick
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Summoner, Arcane Caster, Battlefield Control
  </h4>
    
    <p>Amelia grew up in Myst with her older brother, Ayden. The two had a largely uneventful life growing up; they never struggled to have food on the table, as their father made decent enough money working as a clerk in the Athaeneum, but they were far from privileged. While Ayden was pushed to assist with providing for the family, Amelia was pushed by their mother to focus on her studies. Her small stature and reclusive lifestyle allowed her to foster her natural intelligence and blossom into a promising spellcaster. She joined the Followers of Myst in tandem with her brother seeking to put their skills to use in the lucrative but dangerous life of adventuring, a strong foil to the safe and stable profession of their father. She applied to the First Crusaders, with a tip-off about the opportunity coming from her brother, seeing it as a challenge and a true way to test herself, and was admitted on the merits of her strong knowledge of the arcane and spellcasting ability, along with her pursuit of her enchanting abilities in the hopes that she will in the years to come be able to bolster the strength of the equipment of her allies.</p>
    
    <p>Amelia's preferred spellcasting revolves around the use of arcane summons. She has several familiars who she commands regularly and expertly manages her own mana based around the shifting tides of battle, electing to leave primarily offensive spells to her allies when possible while she focuses on crowd control and targeting the weaknesses of her opponents, harnessing effects that immobilize, slow, or otherwise affect her enemies' ability to fight effectively, thus allowing her summons and allies the openings necessary to achieve victory. While initially she relied mostly on her brother for his offensive spells to compliment her fighting style, she has since adapted to working with the First Crusaders in understanding their strengths to create the necessary openings for her more martially inclined teammates as well.</p>

  <h3>
    Ayden Wypserwick
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Alchemist, Elemental Caster, Herbalist
  </h4>
    
    <p>Ayden grew up in Myst with his younger sister, Amelia. The two had a largely uneventful life growing up; they never struggled to have food on the table, as their father made decent enough money working as a clerk in the Athaeneum, but they were far from privileged. While Ayden was pushed to assist with providing for the family, Amelia was pushed by their mother to focus on her studies. This pushed Ayden away from his studies to some degree, though he has regularly been regarded by his peers as something of a slacker, in contrast to how many see Amelia as very diligent. However, Ayden proved himself a capable alchemist and elemental caster with a demonstrable knowledge of flora not just for alchemical purposes, but for survival as well. While his sister focused on school, he took to the streets of Myst and earned himself a number of connections with other Followers of Myst, established merchants, wandering traders, and the like. His furry ears keep a keen awareness amidst the hushed whispers of taverns, and it was by no accident that he joined the Followers of Myst with his sister.</p>
    
    <p>While a member of the Followers of Myst, a choice that brought some measure of worry to his parents that neither he nor Amelia elected for 'safe' employment, the news of the recreation of the First Crusaders was an opportunity he swiftly came to know about, and applied to join alongside his sister. He was accepted on the merits of his complementary skillset and willingness to face its dangers. His alchemy, of which he has the skill of a journeyman, allows him to create potions for various boons and banes on adventures, and makes use of them where appropriate - such as hurling a flask of oil at his enemy before hitting them with a firebolt to enflame them; his spellcasting is a fair mix of offensive and defensive spells that draw from varied elemental sources. What he lacks in specialty, he makes up for in versatility, even being able to muster some measure of healing magic when necessary, giving him a well-rounded skillset that makes him able to adapt to a wide variety of situations.</p>

  <h3>
    Nila Varuust
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Berzerker, Relentless Attacker, Survivalist
  </h4>
    
    <p>Nila was subject to a traumatic upbringing. Her mother was a Myst-born cleric and member of the Followers of Myst. Her father was half-wolf, and native to the Sun plane of Gurhal. Unfortunately, Nila's parents were taken prisoner, and Nila was born into captivity. Nila's formative years were split between lashing out at her captors, relying only on instinct and her feral blood, and proper education and care given by the Followers of Myst following Nila's rescue, finding the girl in excessive bindings with metal chains keeping her in place; the streaks of dried blood around her cell told the story of what happened to those of her captors who underestimated her, young as she was.</p>
    
    <p>Nila grew up under the care of her adoptive uncle who had spearheaded the rescue effort. While he could not save his sister, he was able to save his niece. Despite Nila's feral blood, she grew up to be a civil person, caring little for the strange looks some might give her for her pronounced wolf features (and general lack of concern for proper clothing when traveling). While she never learned a proper discipline per se, she was admitted to the Followers of Myst due to her remarkable innate magic.</p>
    
    <p>Nila has a strong natural magic which gives her potent regeneration. Sword wounds close and heal over without so much as a scar in a matter of minutes to hours depending on the severity. Cuts and scrapes are gone before a bandage could even be produced to cover them. Burns fade swiftly, and broken bones reset and solidify in just a few short hours under normal conditions. However, her magic is strongly tied to her emotions - positive or negative. When in a strong emotional state, more of her mana reserves become available to her, proportional to the strength of emotion. This usually manifests as the anger and heat of battle spurring her into a rage that allows her to bolster her attacks and see her body shrugging off damage in seconds rather than minutes, while also making her stronger and faster. The brighter the flame of her emotions burn, the faster she will hit her limit, however. As her mana reserves deplete, her regenerative abilities slow, eventually returning to the base, non-magical regeneration anyone else would have; this also is true if she is ever present in an area that disrupts magic - the dampening field within Myst is one such effect to which she is regularly exposed which reduces her healing abilities; this is less pronounced since joining the Followers of Myst, which reduced the effect the field had on her.</p>
    
    <p>Nila is someone who has been slow to trust given her traumatic past, but once earned her trust and loyalty is unshakable. So it was with some hesitation that, with council from her uncle, she joined the First Crusaders. There is still a lot she does not know about what happened with her parents, why it happened, or who was responsible, and even if the thoughts of revenge come and go, her allies in the First Crusaders provide her best chance at discovering these truths. Regardless, she finds her unique talents put to use in her team. Her natural base-level physique is about average compared to her allies, though her fighting style is less refined and tends to prefer overwhelming force where it works, stopping only to intelligently assess her opponents if that fails; at her apex if fueled by strong enough emotion, she is able to achieve feats of strength and durability that outclass all her peers, but only for a short time before burning through all her mana. Her heightened senses allow her a keen awareness both on and off the battlefield, and give her a distinct edge in hunting and tracking; she has refined survivalist skills that make her able to be self-sufficient in many natural environments, and that combined with her natural traits make her adept at wayfinding and crossing most natural terrain without impedance.</p>

  <h3>
    Maeva Denevyr
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Tank, Bruiser, Animal Handler
  </h4>
    
    <p>Maeva grew up raised by a human mother and an absent father whom she knows next to nothing about; she was quick to help her mother when she was old enough to do so, and the two worked as a team through most of Maeva's schooling, leaving less time for socializing while Maeva worked on herself. She dedicated herself to become strong and venture beyond the realm of Myst to find wealth so she could let her mother retire.</p>
    
    <p>Maeva swiftly proved herself physically capable and built up her strength with a deep well of grit and determination. But despite a grueling training regimen, she never lost her kind heart. She comes off as blunt or aloof to many when she is focused on a task, but is sweet to her allies and to all animals - it's not a strange sight to see her baby-talking an animal. In fact, it was after a venture out in search of riches that Maeva returned with an artifact in her possession - a crystal in the shape of a small dragon egg which swirls with strong mana and scintillating colours - that she seemed to acquire the ability to speak with animals. An ability which does require some mana and a moment of concentration to engage, but an unusual feat for a martial warrior all the same. A year or so was spent resting after this adventure, after which time Maeva returned to the adventuring life, having acquired two very young dragon familiars to aide her, with whom she can project her senses so that she may perceive the world through the senses of one of her dragons.</p>
    
    <p>Maeva's martial abilities place her firmly in the role of any party's main frontline fighters; competent ability with swordplay and parrying mixed with a strong, athletic body keeps enemies from breaching the front lines to attack her more vulnerable allies in the back ranks. Because of this, she was an easy choice to take among the applicants to the First Crusaders - while she's not the only martial adept, she ranks among the strongest in terms of raw physique. Her dragon familiars pose as scouts for the party most often, and the high aerial view of open-air battles help the group stay aware of potential ambushes. </p>

  <h3>
    Elodie Dawncrest
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Sentinel, Pursuer, Frontline Support
  </h4>
      
      <p>The Dawncrest family aren't exactly nobles, as no nobility exists within Myst, but they certainly are a name many know as affluent traders. A fair amount of money allowed the Dawncrest family to ensure their daughter, Elodie, wanted for little. While schooling in Myst remains strict and egalitarian, Elodie had the benefits of a private tutor and trainer that allowed her to train well in the way of martial combat, as well as have the talents of playing the lute, flute, and harp, and picked up the hobby of being a seamstress some time along the way - expensive fabrics were never in short supply for her to practice with.</p>
      
      <p>The subjects of her private tutoring gave her a solid understanding of the fundamentals of many martial weapons. She specialized further into polearms, and specifically found further specialty in the art of denying enemies a safe retreat. Whether it be hooking a leg or impaling someone with a thrown spear against a wall, she managed to create a fighting style for herself that helped her find just the right moments to press her attacks to keep enemies where they should be, instead of running away to safety or running past her to her more vulnerable allies behind her. In the event things go wrong, she studied arcane spellcasting just enough to get a solid foundation with teleportation magic that gives her the ability to swap places with willing allies, or swap two willing allies with each other to ensure enemies are always standing face to face with their least advantageous matchup in the group, and her allies are always able to fight the enemies that allow them to play to their strengths. She also managed to pick up a few spells which help her with the fluidity of her motions and ones that bolster her speed. If a runner is needed, she is often the best pick.</p>
      
      <p>She was an obvious shoe-in for the Followers of Myst, and despite her upbringing she wasn't afforded any special considerations. She genuinely had become a skilled fighter. Her interest in battle tactics naturally brought her to see Amara as something of a mentor upon hearing about Amara's tactical genius, and so it was with determination that she made her case to join the First Crusaders to learn from one of Myst's most promising tactical fighters.</p>

  <h3>
    Ceridwen Duskcowl
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Necromancer, Dark Magic Caster
  </h4>
  
  <p>Ceridwen, or Ceri to her friends, grew up as something of a misunderstood child in Myst. Myst provides plenty of support for the school of Necromancy, but even among her peers she had always had interactions with others play out with a degree of nervousness from others; this, combined with her lower class upbringing stemming from a mother who died in childbirth, and a father who was overworked and underpaid, created a woman who became easily capable of fixating on her work with the necromatic arts. A person of good morals at heart, she is sometimes described as a touch chaotic; she holds reverence for innocent life, but less reverence for the steps it may take to protect it.</p>
    
    <p>Despite her upbringing, Ceridwen had managed to pursue her craft in Myst and became a member of the Followers of Myst without issue, finding lucrative work in the less populated ranks of scholars of necromancy which has allowed her to ascend to a more comfortable lifestyle. In this time, she came to hear of the grim fates of the previous First Crusaders, and was encouraged by her peers to join them. After all, so long as she remained alive, the First Crusaders would never lose another member in battle; even a simple use of <i>Revivify</i> would ensure her allies make it back alive. Ceridwen found Amara to hold no judgement, and indeed saw the value of Ceridwen's skillset, and so Ceridwen was inducted into the group without incident.</p>
    
    <p>On top of Ceridwen's ability to revive others, her spellcasting abilities extend into dark-aligned magics, evoking debilitating effects on her enemies whose constitutions can be broken by her mana, and similarly has the capacity to break simple curses that afflict her allies. She also has the capabilities to speak with spirits and the dead, which can prove invaluable when the last person to know the location of their current targeted artifact had taken those secrets to their grave. </p>

  <h3>
    Estrella Myrdith
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Duelist, Spellsword, Eldritch Knight
  </h4>
    
    <p>Estrella, sometimes "Essa" to her friends, is a woman whose interests split between martial and magical. She had a great many tutors among the scholars and teachers of Myst growing up who eventually steered her towards the discipline of the Spellsword - the marriage of magic and martial prowess, often concerned with empowering her strikes with magic to fell her opponents with a single strike whenever she can. Her mother remains a teacher at the Athenaeum, while her father tends to their home in Myst while pursuing life as a hobbyist inventor and tinkerer since Estrella grew old enough to be independent and move into their own home.</p>
    
    <p>Estrella's mother pushed her to become part of the Followers of Myst, and indeed the decision had been fruitful in exposing Estrella to the realities beyond the theory of her craft. Being able to fit into what felt natural to her, she gained something of a strong head about her. While not one to be rude to her allies, she might view others she views as beneath her with condescension; indeed, despite being a duelist with her blade, she never saw merit in training extensively with a shield, confident in her abilities with her blade to keep her safe. So far, she has proven herself capable of mixing her arcane abilities with her martial adeptness. Enough that when the perceived challenge of the First Crusaders arose, she jumped at the chance to be a part of the group and earn a name for herself.</p>
    
    <p>In battle, she takes her place among the front ranks and favours a staunch offence, striking at enemies in their weak spots whenever possible while taking enemies by surprise with arcane and elemental spells to keep her enemies on the defensive. Of course, working with a team has required some measure of humbling of her skills so that the team can work most effectively together, rather than any one person shining above, but the pursuit of personal glory is not something one sheds easily. She also assists her allies by way of knowledge of the basics of first aid, being able to take care of her allies if all other members who focus on healing are unavailable. More to her skillset is her dungeoneering abilities, which are second only to Kaspar's.</p>

  <h3>
    Rinnie Vystira
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Dedicated Healer, Support Caster
  </h4>
      
      <p>Rinnie is the youngest of the First Crusaders. She is a recent graduate of the Athenaeum, mentoring under purist healers to dedicate herself to the arts of healing, while also being the child of parents who both also chose the same discipline; the surname Vystira has some minor renown for being a family of healers, set to continue with Rinnie. </p>
      
      <p>Healing being her primary discipline, she focuses primarily on that, but has some other capacity to strengthen and defend allies - it is common wisdom among healing magi that often, damage mitigation can be the most effective healing, and so defensive and similarly supporting spells are a staple of her spellbook. She showcased strong potential, which was not very surprising to most given her name, and became a member of the Followers of Myst soon after graduation from the Athenaeum. It wasn't long after that when the position for the First Crusaders become available, and she focused on joining as a way of experiencing the many realms of the multiverse while contributing to the city of Myst which helped her hone her skills. She is a bright and chipper personality, strongly optimistic even if her youth leaves her naive on many aspects; a topic in which she has reliable knowledge is religious pantheons and divine lore. While there are too many pantheons for one person to possibly know, similarities between them make her a go-to when trying to ensure that the group avoids incurring any divine retribution in their travels.</p>
      
      <p>Despite her inexperience, she was invited to join the First Crusaders, as no other members were specifically dedicated to the healing arts - Ceridwen's healing "after the fact" didn't quite count. As well, she has a repertoire of spells which are effective at combatting ailments of various sorts to ensure that maladies and infections of all sorts do not keep the group down for long. Given her role within the group and lack of any significant offensive capacity, she is protected by her allies at all costs when in combat. </p>

  <h4>
    Archer, Ranger, Survivalist

  <p>Primary abilities include proficiency with most types of longbow, shortbow, and crossbow, as well as magic which support their archery, such as allowing magically-enhanced stability, extreme breath control, and the ability to channel magic to see the wind, humidity, and other factors which affect her shots. Her magic also allows her to prepare elemental arrows in advance and is able to expend mana to fire arcane arrows either on their own (if out of ammo) or as a volley. Other talents include moderately refined survival skills including hunting and trapping, firemaking, shelter-building, and foraging, moderate animal handling skills, decent skills with lockpicking and dungeoneering.</p>

  <h3>
    Kaspar Lumos
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Rogue, Infiltrator, Assassin
  </h4>
    
    <p>Kaspar grew up something of a rebel. While his parents encouraged him to pursue a life of charity and good-will, he never really clicked with the idea of mundane efforts. Against his parent's wishes, he focused on the arts of rogues, turncoats, or whatever titles one might give to the face that smiles in front of their enemies and stabs them in the back the moment one's guard drops. While a good person at heart, the stories of suffering masses being the responsibility of charitable, kind-hearted people like his parents always left a bitter taste in his mouth when seeing fat aristocrats laughing atop their hoards while the homeless begged in the street.</p>
    
    <p>So, with a newfound skillset for targeting the people who most deserved lethal retribution, developed under the mentorship of a few of Myst's rogueish instructors, he joined the Followers of Myst, guided by the egalitarian morals of Myst, to seek to right wrongs where he found them. The First Crusaders became a promising opportunity for him in the way of "repossessing" artifacts that may have fallen into the wrong hands; while many they seek might be without owner or lost in a dangerous place, some indeed historically have been in the hands of evildoers. And for those they retrieve that are otherwise without an owner, they can be safely passed to the responsible hands of those at Myst, rather than risk being acquired by someone of genocidal intent.</p>
    
    <p>Kaspar's skillset includes familiarity with many finesse weapons, including the custom-made claw weapons of his which have become his favoured tool - much to the approval of Nila - with a fighting style that seeks to evade his enemy until either they wear out or they expose their weakness to be lethally exploited. Beyond his weapon, he is able to utelize magic that creates illusory decoys of himself, and has an innate darkvision and developed resistance to cold damage and temperature. He spent much of his time before joining the First Crusaders as a lone dungeon-delver, and as such has excellent dungeoneering skills as well as a strong knowledge of common dungeon traps; he has never been fooled by a mimic, and his eyes always scan the dark corners and ceilings for anything that might be lurking and waiting for a chance to strike. Common locks are child's play to him, and his exceptional agility allows him to perform complex motions through the halls of dungeons with frightening silence.</p>
