<h2>
  The First Crusaders
  </h2>
  
  <p>Legends speak of the creation of Myst, of how the Wizard of Myst summoned his unfathomable power to create the realm itself. Following its creation, legends speak of a band of adventurers. Adventurers whose goal it was to seek the secrets of the multiverse. To explore the unexplored. To find tomes of lost knowledge. To find artifacts of grand power. They were the First Crusaders. A band of adventurers whose sole purpose in founding Myst was to venture out and begin the unparalleled collection that now exists today. With time, the original First Crusaders succumbed. But as each member fell, it was decided that another would replace them and maintain the mission of the First Crusaders.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>The tradition continues to the modern day. The First Crusaders are a band of adventurers whose purpose is to seek the unknown, to acquire the treasures and mysteries of the multiverse. To aide in this, the leader of the First Crusaders guild must always be a member of the Followers of Myst who is a member of the Closed Circuit - the trusted circle of guild members who have proven themselves worthy of access to the secrets of knowledge most dangerous - to ensure they fully grasp the gravity of the missions they undertake, and to ensure the powerful things they retrieve will be returned to Myst.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>While the members of the First Crusaders need not necessarily be individually the strongest, smartest, most agile or most powerful, the members all must work together to achieve their missions, and in that camraderie comes strength. These missions can be as short as a few weeks, or as long as years on end. It is common that they will find themselves juggling the acquisition of multiple targets of interest at any given time. They may find themselves working all together as one cohesive unit, or segregated into teams where required. Many past members of the First Crusaders later go on to join other groups within the Followers of Myst. Others remain in the First Crusaders until death; death remains a very real possibility, as the missions the First Crusaders undertake can see them travelling to inhospitable places, deadly dungeons, and areas with active conflict or political unrest. After all, if the treasures they sought were so easily obtained, they would be snatched up far before the First Crusaders could acquire them. The deadly trials they face together act as a sobering induction into adventuring life, and when planes apart from home, they can only rely on each other to survive.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The captain of the First Crusaders is chosen by the administrators of the Followers of Myst; they must be able to gain admittence into the Closed Circuit if they are not already a member of it. The captain is then able to select the others in the group. People may apply specifically, or may be approached to join. For some, the position is a way to broaden their skills, as the group very regularly sees adventure for long periods of time. For others, it is a stepping stone in their path to other places within the guild. While in the immediate generations that followed the original First Crusaders, the group maintained exclusivity to elite members, that tradition has over time shifted to be more welcoming of any adventurer, so long as they understand what they are getting themselves into. Like with the Followers of Myst as a whole, the group itself benefits from the adventurers being able to learn from one another.
  </p>
  
  <p>In recent history, Myst received the grim news that the existing First Crusaders were all slain in battle with no survivors; their arcanist was only able to, with his final message, make use of a Sending Stone to relay to his fate to the administrators of the Followers of Myst with the words: "We have failed. I'm sorry.". In light of this, the tradition has continued with the appointment of a new captain and new members. Below, you'll find the current members of the First Crusaders, and their respective specialties.

  <h3>
    Amara Sunsong
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Captain, Paladin, Healer
  </h4>
    
    <p>Amara Sunsong, the current captain of the First Crusaders, remains somewhat closed off about her history. She is a friendly person overall, but tends to avoid talking about herself. She came to become the captain of the First Crusaders, following the tragic loss of the previous members, after a number of years in the Followers of Myst. During this time, she earned the respect of her peers by showcasing a selfless attitude, a very keen tactical mind, and a strength in leadership on top of her compotent skill in martial combat, showing particular skill with polearms. She holds no delusions about the dangers she faces, and her responsibility to her allies to see that history does not repeat itself. She wields light-attuned magic, and she has been described as having a natural gift for all light-based magic, while struggling with most other forms of magic. This magic manifests in her ability to heal, as well as perform a versatile array of offensive spells, as well as suffuse herself with auras which bolster her allies.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of combat, she is generally a tender and kind person. She strives to earn the respect of those around her and gain their trust through friendship and loyalty. She looks out for her friends, and is known to be an excellent cook. She is a thoughtful, observant person who presents with a great degree of emotional maturity. This has allowed her to be well-regarded as a good fit for her position, and this contributes to having brought some measure of renown to the current First Crusaders, where past generations may have proven more forgettable. </p>

  <h3>
    Amelia Wysperwick
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Summoner, Arcane Caster, Battlefield Control
  </h4>
    
    <p>Amelia grew up in Myst with her older brother, Ayden. The two had a largely uneventful life growing up; they never struggled to have food on the table, as their father made decent enough money working as a clerk in the Athaeneum, but they were far from privledged. While Ayden was pushed to assist with providing for the family, Amelia was pushed by their mother to focus on her studies. Her small stature and reclusive lifestyle allowed her to foster her natural intelligence and blossom into a promising spellcaster. She joined the Followers of Myst in tandem with her brother seeking to put their skills to use in the lucrative but dangerous life of adventuring, a strong foil to the safe and stable profession of their father. She applied to the First Crusaders, with a tip-off about the opportunity coming from her brother, seeing it as a challenge and a true way to test herself, and was admitted on the merits of her strong knowledge of the arcane and spellcasting ability, along with her pursuit of her enchanting abilities in the hopes that she will in the years to come be able to bolster the strength of the equipment of her allies.</p>
    
    <p>Amelia's preferred spellcasting revolves around the use of arcane summons. She has several familiars who she commands regularly and expertly manages her own mana based around the shifting tides of battle, electing to leave primarily offensive spells to her allies when possbile while she focuses on crowd control and targeting the weaknesses of her opponents, harnessing effects that immobilize, slow, or otherwise affect her enemies' ability to fight effectively, thus allowing her summons and allies the openings necessary to achieve victory. While initially she relied mostly on her brother for his offensive spells to compliment her fighting style, she has since adapted to working with the First Crusaders in understanding their strengths to create the necessay openings for her more martially inclined teammates as well.</p>

  <h3>
    Ayden Wypserwick
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Alchemist, Elemental Caster, Herbalist
  </h4>
    
    <p>Ayden grew up in Myst with his younger sister, Amelia. The two had a largely uneventful life growing up; they never struggled to have food on the table, as their father made decent enough money working as a clerk in the Athaeneum, but they were far from privledged. While Ayden was pushed to assist with providing for the family, Amelia was pushed by their mother to focus on her studies. This pushed Ayden away from his studies to some degree, though he has regularly been regarded by his peers as something of a slacker, in contrast to how many see Amelia as very diligent. However, Ayden proved himself a capable alchemist and elemental caster with a demonstrable knowledge of flora not just for alchemical purposes, but for survival as well. While his sister focused on school, he took to the streets of Myst and earned himself a number of connections with other Followers of Myst, established merchants, wandering traders, and the like. His furry ears keep a keen awareness amidst the hushed whispers of taverns, and it was by no accident that he joined the Followers of Myst with his sister.</p>
    
    <p>While a member of the Followers of Myst, a choice that brought some measure of worry to his parents that neither he nor Amelia elected for 'safe' employment, the news of the recreation of the First Crusaders was an opportunity he swiftly came to know about, and applied to join alongside his sister. He was accepted on the merits of his complementary skillset and willingness to face its dangers. His alchemy, of which he has the skill of a journeyman, allows him to create potions for various boons and banes on adventures, and makes use of them where appropriate - such as hurling a flask of oil at his enemy before hitting them with a firebolt to enflame them; his spellcasting is a fair mix of offensive and defensive spells that draw from varied elemental sources. What he lacks in specialty, he makes up for in versatility, even being able to muster some measure of healing magic when necessary, giving him a well-rounded skillset that makes him able to adapt to a wide variety of situations.</p>
