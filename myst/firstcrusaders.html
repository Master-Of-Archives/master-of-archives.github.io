<h2>
  The First Crusaders
  </h2>
  
  <p>Legends speak of the creation of Myst, of how the Wizard of Myst summoned his unfathomable power to create the realm itself. Following its creation, legends speak of a band of adventurers. Adventurers whose goal it was to seek the secrets of the multiverse. To explore the unexplored. To find tomes of lost knowledge. To find artifacts of grand power. They were the First Crusaders. A band of adventurers whose sole purpose in founding Myst was to venture out and begin the unparalleled collection that now exists today. With time, the original First Crusaders succumbed. But as each member fell, it was decided that another would replace them and maintain the mission of the First Crusaders.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>The tradition continues to the modern day. The First Crusaders are a band of adventurers whose purpose is to seek the unknown, to acquire the treasures and mysteries of the multiverse. To aide in this, the leader of the First Crusaders guild must always be a member of the Followers of Myst who is a member of the Closed Circuit - the trusted circle of guild members who have proven themselves worthy of access to the secrets of knowledge most dangerous - to ensure they fully grasp the gravity of the missions they undertake, and to ensure the powerful things they retrieve will be returned to Myst.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>While the members of the First Crusaders need not necessarily be individually the strongest, smartest, most agile or most powerful, the members all must work together to achieve their missions, and in that camraderie comes strength. These missions can be as short as a few weeks, or as long as years on end. It is common that they will find themselves juggling the acquisition of multiple targets of interest at any given time. They may find themselves working all together as one cohesive unit, or segregated into teams where required. Many past members of the First Crusaders later go on to join other groups within the Followers of Myst. Others remain in the First Crusaders until death; death remains a very real possibility, as the missions the First Crusaders undertake can see them travelling to inhospitable places, deadly dungeons, and areas with active conflict or political unrest. After all, if the treasures they sought were so easily obtained, they would be snatched up far before the First Crusaders could acquire them. The deadly trials they face together act as a sobering induction into adventuring life, and when planes apart from home, they can only rely on each other to survive.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The captain of the First Crusaders is chosen by the administrators of the Followers of Myst; they must be able to gain admittence into the Closed Circuit if they are not already a member of it. The captain is then able to select the others in the group. People may apply specifically, or may be approached to join. For some, the position is a way to broaden their skills, as the group very regularly sees adventure for long periods of time. For others, it is a stepping stone in their path to other places within the guild. While in the immediate generations that followed the original First Crusaders, the group maintained exclusivity to elite members, that tradition has over time shifted to be more welcoming of any adventurer, so long as they understand what they are getting themselves into. Like with the Followers of Myst as a whole, the group itself benefits from the adventurers being able to learn from one another.
  </p>
  
  <p>In recent history, Myst received the grim news that the existing First Crusaders were all slain in battle with no survivors; their arcanist was only able to, with his final message, make use of a Sending Stone to relay to his fate to the administrators of the Followers of Myst with the words: "We have failed. I'm sorry.". In light of this, the tradition has continued with the appointment of a new captain and new members. Below, you'll find the current members of the First Crusaders, and their respective specialties.

  <h3>
    Amara Sunsong
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Captain, Paladin, Healer
  </h4>
    
    <p>Amara Sunsong, the current captain of the First Crusaders, remains somewhat closed off about her history. She is a friendly person overall, but tends to avoid talking about herself. She came to become the captain of the First Crusaders, following the tragic loss of the previous members, after a number of years in the Followers of Myst. During this time, she earned the respect of her peers by showcasing a selfless attitude, a very keen tactical mind, and a strength in leadership on top of her compotent skill in martial combat, showing particular skill with polearms. She holds no delusions about the dangers she faces, and her responsibility to her allies to see that history does not repeat itself. She wields light-attuned magic, and she has been described as having a natural gift for all light-based magic, while struggling with most other forms of magic. This magic manifests in her ability to heal, as well as perform a versatile array of offensive spells, as well as suffuse herself with auras which bolster her allies.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of combat, she is generally a tender and kind person. She strives to earn the respect of those around her and gain their trust through friendship and loyalty. She looks out for her friends, and is known to be an excellent cook. She is a thoughtful, observant person who presents with a great degree of emotional maturity. This has allowed her to be well-regarded as a good fit for her position, and this contributes to having brought some measure of renown to the current First Crusaders, where past generations may have proven more forgettable. </p>

  <h3>
    Amelia Wysperwick
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Summoner, Arcane Caster, Battlefield Control
  </h4>
    
    <p>Amelia grew up in Myst with her older brother, Ayden. The two had a largely uneventful life growing up; they never struggled to have food on the table, as their father made decent enough money working as a clerk in the Athaeneum, but they were far from privledged. While Ayden was pushed to assist with providing for the family, Amelia was pushed by their mother to focus on her studies. Her small stature and reclusive lifestyle allowed her to foster her natural intelligence and blossom into a promising spellcaster. She joined the Followers of Myst in tandem with her brother seeking to put their skills to use in the lucrative but dangerous life of adventuring, a strong foil to the safe and stable profession of their father. She applied to the First Crusaders, with a tip-off about the opportunity coming from her brother, seeing it as a challenge and a true way to test herself, and was admitted on the merits of her strong knowledge of the arcane and spellcasting ability, along with her pursuit of her enchanting abilities in the hopes that she will in the years to come be able to bolster the strength of the equipment of her allies.</p>
    
    <p>Amelia's preferred spellcasting revolves around the use of arcane summons. She has several familiars who she commands regularly and expertly manages her own mana based around the shifting tides of battle, electing to leave primarily offensive spells to her allies when possbile while she focuses on crowd control and targeting the weaknesses of her opponents, harnessing effects that immobilize, slow, or otherwise affect her enemies' ability to fight effectively, thus allowing her summons and allies the openings necessary to achieve victory. While initially she relied mostly on her brother for his offensive spells to compliment her fighting style, she has since adapted to working with the First Crusaders in understanding their strengths to create the necessay openings for her more martially inclined teammates as well.</p>

  <h3>
    Ayden Wypserwick
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Alchemist, Elemental Caster, Herbalist
  </h4>
    
    <p>Ayden grew up in Myst with his younger sister, Amelia. The two had a largely uneventful life growing up; they never struggled to have food on the table, as their father made decent enough money working as a clerk in the Athaeneum, but they were far from privledged. While Ayden was pushed to assist with providing for the family, Amelia was pushed by their mother to focus on her studies. This pushed Ayden away from his studies to some degree, though he has regularly been regarded by his peers as something of a slacker, in contrast to how many see Amelia as very diligent. However, Ayden proved himself a capable alchemist and elemental caster with a demonstrable knowledge of flora not just for alchemical purposes, but for survival as well. While his sister focused on school, he took to the streets of Myst and earned himself a number of connections with other Followers of Myst, established merchants, wandering traders, and the like. His furry ears keep a keen awareness amidst the hushed whispers of taverns, and it was by no accident that he joined the Followers of Myst with his sister.</p>
    
    <p>While a member of the Followers of Myst, a choice that brought some measure of worry to his parents that neither he nor Amelia elected for 'safe' employment, the news of the recreation of the First Crusaders was an opportunity he swiftly came to know about, and applied to join alongside his sister. He was accepted on the merits of his complementary skillset and willingness to face its dangers. His alchemy, of which he has the skill of a journeyman, allows him to create potions for various boons and banes on adventures, and makes use of them where appropriate - such as hurling a flask of oil at his enemy before hitting them with a firebolt to enflame them; his spellcasting is a fair mix of offensive and defensive spells that draw from varied elemental sources. What he lacks in specialty, he makes up for in versatility, even being able to muster some measure of healing magic when necessary, giving him a well-rounded skillset that makes him able to adapt to a wide variety of situations.</p>

  <h3>
    [Fenrir - Faith]
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Berzerker, Relentless Attacker, Survivalist
  </h4>
    
    
  
  <p>Primary abilities include a strong latent magic that stymies bleeding from open wounds and causes them to heal over rapidly, general high physical strength, natural claws, keen hearing, smell, and eyesight, magic which strengthens in response to strong emotion that bolsters physical strength, resulting in a tenacious (but not limitless) brawler. Fighting style is feral, but not necessarily without intelligence. Other talents include strong survival skills including firemaking, hunting, foraging/scavenging, and trapping. Has an excellent sense of direction and is skillfully able to traverse any natural terrain. </p>

  <h3>
    Maeva Denevyr
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Tank, Bruiser, Animal Handler
  </h4>
    
    <p>Maeva grew up raised by a human mother and an absent father whom she knows next to nothing about; she was quick to help her mother when she was old enough to do so, and the two worked as a team through most of Maeva's schooling, leaving less time for socializing while Maeva worked on herself. She dedicated herself to become strong and venture beyond the realm of Myst to find wealth so she could let her mother retire.</p>
    
    <p>Maeva swiftly proved herself physically capable and built up her strength with a deep well of grit and determination. But despite a grueling training regimen, she never lost her kind heart. She comes off as blunt or aloof to many when she is focused on a task, but is sweet to her allies and to all animals - it's not a strange sight to see her baby-talking an animal. In fact, it was after a venture out in search of riches that Maeva returned with an artifact in her possession - a crystal in the shape of a small dragon egg which swirls with strong mana and scintilating colours - that she seemed to acquire the ability to speak with animals. An ability which does require some mana and a moment of concentration to engage, but an unusual feat for a matrial warrior all the same. A year or so was spent resting after this adventure, after which time Maeva returned to the adventuring life, having acquired two very young dragon familiars to aide her, with whom she can project her senses so that she may perceive the world through the senses of one of her dragons.</p>
    
    <p>Maeva's martial abilities place her firmly in the role of any party's main frontline fighters; compotent ability with swordplay and parrying mixed with a strong, atheltic body keeps enemies from breaching the front lines to attack her more vulnerable allies in the back ranks. Because of this, she was an easy choice to take among the applicants to the First Crusaders - while she's not the only martial adept, she ranks among the strongest in terms of raw physique. Her dragon familiars pose as scouts for the party most often, and the high aerial view of open-air battles help the group stay aware of potential ambushes. </p>

  <h3>
    Elodie Dawncrest
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Sentinel, Pursuer, Frontline Support
  </h4>
      
      <p>The Dawncrest family aren't exactly nobles, as no nobility exists within Myst, but they certainly are a name many know as affluent traders. A fair amount of money allowed the Dawncrest family to ensure their daughter, Elodie, wanted for little. While schooling in Myst remains strict and egalitarian, Elodie had the benefits of a private tutor and trainer that allowed her to train well in the way of martial combat, as well as have the talents of playing the lute, flute, and harp, and picked up the hobby of being a seamstress some time along the way - expensive fabrics were never in short supply for her to practice with.</p>
      
      <p>The subjects of her private tutoring gave her a solid understanding of the fundamentals of many martial weapons. She specialized further into polearms, and specifically found further specialty in the art of denying enemies a safe retreat. Whether it be hooking a leg or impaling someone with a thrown spear against a wall, she managed to create a fighting style for herself that helped her find just the right moments to press her attacks to keep enemies where they should be, instead of running away to safety or running past her to her more vulnerable allies behind her. In the event things go wrong, she studied arcane spellcasting just enough to get a solid foundation with teleportation magic that gives her the ability to swap places with willing allies, or swap two willing allies with each other to ensure enemies are always standing face to face with their least adventageous matchup in the group, and her allies are always able to fight the enemies that allow them to play to their strengths. She also managed to pick up a few spells which help her with the fluidity of her motions and ones that bolster her speed. If a runner is needed, she is often the best pick.</p>
      
      <p>She was an obvious shoe-in for the Followers of Myst, and despite her upbringing she wasn't afforded any special considerations. She genuinely had become a skilled fighter. Her interest in battle tactics naturally brought her to see Amara as something of a mentor upon hearing about Amara's tactical genius, and so it was with determination that she made her case to join the First Crusaders to learn from one of Myst's most promising tactical fighters.</p>

  <h3>
    Ceridwen Duskcowl
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Necromancer, Dark Magic Caster
  </h4>
  
  <p>Ceridwen, or Ceri to her friends, grew up as something of a misunderstood child in Myst. Myst provides plenty of support for the school of Necromancy, but even among her peers she had always had interactions with others play out with a degree of nervousness from others; this, combined with her lower class upbringing stemming from a mother who died in childbirth, and a father who was overworked and underpaid, created a woman who became easily capable of fixating on her work with the necromatic arts. A person of good morals at heart, she is sometimes described as a touch chaotic; she holds reverence for innocent life, but less reverence for the steps it may take to protect it.</p>
    
    <p>Despite her upbringing, Ceridwen had managed to pursue her craft in Myst and became a member of the Followers of Myst without issue, finding lucrative work in the less populated ranks of scholars of necromancy which has allowed her to ascend to a more comfortable lifestyle. In this time, she came to hear of the grim fates of the previous First Crusaders, and was encouraged by her peers to join them. After all, so long as she remained alive, the First Crusaders would never lose another member in battle; even a simple use of <i>Revivify</i> would ensure her allies make it back alive. Ceridwen found Amara to hold no judgement, and indeed saw the value of Ceridwen's skillset, and so Ceridwen was inducted into the group without incident.</p>
    
    <p>On top of Ceridwen's ability to revive others, her spellcasting abilities extend into dark-aligned magics, evoking debilitating effects on her enemies whose constitutions can be broken by her mana, and similarly has the capacity to break simple curses that afflict her allies. She also has the capabilities to speak with spirits and the dead, which can prove invaluable when the last person to know the location of their current targeted artifact had taken those secrets to their grave. </p>
