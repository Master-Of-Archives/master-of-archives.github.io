<h2>
  The First Crusaders
  </h2>
  
  <p>Legends speak of the creation of Myst, of how the Wizard of Myst summoned his unfathomable power to create the realm itself. Following its creation, legends speak of a band of adventurers. Adventurers whose goal it was to seek the secrets of the multiverse. To explore the unexplored. To find tomes of lost knowledge. To find artifacts of grand power. They were the First Crusaders. A band of adventurers whose sole purpose in founding Myst was to venture out and begin the unparalleled collection that now exists today. With time, the original First Crusaders succumbed. But as each member fell, it was decided that another would replace them and maintain the mission of the First Crusaders.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>The tradition continues to the modern day. The First Crusaders are a band of adventurers whose purpose is to seek the unknown, to acquire the treasures and mysteries of the multiverse. To aide in this, the leader of the First Crusaders guild must always be a member of the Followers of Myst who is a member of the Closed Circuit - the trusted circle of guild members who have proven themselves worthy of access to the secrets of knowledge most dangerous - to ensure they fully grasp the gravity of the missions they undertake, and to ensure the powerful things they retrieve will be returned to Myst.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>While the members of the First Crusaders need not necessarily be individually the strongest, smartest, most agile or most powerful, the members all must work together to achieve their missions, and in that camraderie comes strength. These missions can be as short as a few weeks, or as long as years on end. It is common that they will find themselves juggling the acquisition of multiple targets of interest at any given time. They may find themselves working all together as one cohesive unit, or segregated into teams where required. Many past members of the First Crusaders later go on to join other groups within the Followers of Myst. Others remain in the First Crusaders until death.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>Below, you'll find the current members of the First Crusaders, and their respective specialties.
