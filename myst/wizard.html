  <h2>The Wizard of Myst</h2>
  
  <p>Little knowledge is concrete about the Wizard of Myst. Many scholars disagree on his existence. Some regard him with great praise, others assume the legend is simply that - a legend - and that Myst came to be through more typical means, as other planes had come to be. Below, you will find notable passages from various authors who have written about the subject.
  </p>
  
  <h3>From author Ildrath Thyrrun, Arcane magi, notable skeptic:</h3>
  
  <p> <i>"On the subject of the Wizard of Myst, the man - as he certainly was a man - had unlocked a secret that none before nor after to the time of this publication ever have. The secret? Simple. Perfect deception. To permit the supposition that he had created an entire realm is absurd. The magic of Myst is the work of gods, not mortals. It is my intent to prove beyond reasonable doubt in my research that Myst was the creation of the ever-turning gears of Mechanus. The machine-gods of the realm would certainly produce a city like this. Precise, perfect, and with every contingency planned, down to the dampening field that prevents other magi from seizing it."</i>
  </p>
  
  <h3>From author Akarus Yami, respected artificier of Aetheria:</h3>
  
  <p> <i>"The Wizard of Myst is a curious tale. Old enough that its facts have faded into obscurity, and all first-hand accounts certainly perished. One must wonder: did he keep close allies? Did they swear into a pact of secrecy to take to the grave? Surely, a man of such power would have credible descendants whose lineage can trace back to the time when the Wizard did live. That he lived? That is certain in my mind. Artifice can give way to the powers attributed to him. A suitably powerful catalyst for his spell with reserves of mana potent enough to execute his will is far more within the realm of reason than his capacity to summon this mana from his mortal body. But to hide such a thing from others? I would declare that far more impressive a feat than the creation of the city itself! Surely, just as the ethics of Myst dictate - such a thing should remain so closely guarded, as the wrong hands upon such a thing would spell the end of days for us all."</i>
  </p>
  
  <h3>From author Keasalor Bluespell, notable scholar of legend lore:</h3>
  
  <p> <i>"He is majesty. He is power. Beyond all, he is the creator. Oh, how his legacy graces us. The gift of this glorious city of gates. The freedom from ravenous beasts. The freedom from tyrants. In his mind: a paradise. He did create it, and certainly left behind a trail for those most intelligent among us to find the truths of his legacy. Notable excursions are documented well enough - we may not know it, but the secrets we seek might very well already be in our possession, or thoughtlessly overlooked by someone! We cannot say for certain until we have explored all possibilities. The perfectly beautiful symmetry of Myst is too much to deny it the product of intelligent design - and he was certainly intelligent! So much that his motives, if ever known to us, might prove so impossibly cryptic in even the simplest terms. It is as worthy a goal as any could be to seek his truths."</i>
  </p>
  
  <h3>From author Lasria Rahen, scholar of dwarven masterworks:</h3>
  
  <p> <i>"To consider the perfection of Myst's stoneworks and careful attenuation of its mana batteries, it is absurd to consider it a creation of anything but the hard, working hands of master metalworkers and smiths and stonecutters and mana weavers. The Wizard of Myst was not one man. It was surely a thousand people all masquerading as the same person to create such a legend as his. Even more certain am I that it was not a 'he' but a 'she' at the helm of such a thing. Aye, a magi queen leading the ranks of others for one sole purpose. A grand tale indeed - what a leader she would have been! But to ask that anyone believe such perfection of creation done on such a grand scale all at once, with the wave of a hand, is absurd. Years upon decades upon centuries of hard, manual labour from loving hands of generations of crafters. Aye, to cast aside such whimsical beliefs is the only way to think. Belief in such grand acts of magic is for children."</i>

  <h3>From author Maya Chamberlain, respected Alchemist and arcane scholar:</h3>
  
  <p> <i>"The human experience is too short. The elven one long, but even it not long enough to trace back to the time of the Wizard of Myst by some estimates. Even the Arethi know only of his services through faded tales. But I do assert my reputation to stake belief in his feat. That he did create Myst. That the secrets, the answers to this mystery, still exist, waiting to be found. Such a man could not have been without his suitors. Perhaps a great descendant of his walks the planes to this very day, perfectly sworn to secrecy or perhaps even unaware of this ancestry. There are many poems that allude to him, cryptic and winding as they may be. Picked apart a thousand different ways, I find the ones which dismiss and take them as literal interpretations far too cynical. This magical world of ours hides so many secrets in the must mundane ways; it is only through a keen mind that such mysteries can be deciphered."</i>

  <h3>Taken from a page from a journal of Xannus the Clear, legendary master wizard of invisibility:</h3>
  
  <p> <i>"I have known a great many persons in my life. I would like to have known the Wizard of Myst, had I lived when he did so. But by estimates, a thousand or so years separate us. That mastery of magic could remedy wrongs beyond the scope of imagination. One can only speculate, then, that he ascribed to a philosophy that put the trust in the future, not in himself. For a hero who rights wrongs by hand will create a golden age around him so long as he lives, and spell the opening for evil to rise up more powerful than ever when he passes. A wisdom I carry with me from my dearest friend [The name here is missing, as a hole about the size of an iron arrowhead is punched through the paper]. To see the bigger picture encompassing the entire multiverse beyond the scope of your own life, and perhaps even sacrificing your own life to make it a reality...Yes, that is a man with whom I would give anything to sit with for a few hours over tea and simply talk."</i>
