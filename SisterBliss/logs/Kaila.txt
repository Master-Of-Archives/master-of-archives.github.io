Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 6:40pm] It had been a big day. Kaila had graduated from high school and had only a week to rest. Miya and Yvette were working on their own plans, and it had been a week of packing and take-out. Everything Kaila wanted to take had to go in boxes. Of course, their bedroom would not need to be emptied entirely; a bed would always be there for Kaila if they ever needed to come back to live with mom & mom. But this was poised to be Kaila's new home for the next few years at least. It had been assured that Kaila wouldn't be shooed or sent out from Ophelia's home even after graduation from postsecondary. A supportive family all around. But then it was a full day and a half on the road. Hours on end, interrupted by stopping at truck stops, then a hotel for the night, then up again at 8am to get back on the road. Occasional stops for food, to stretch, but there was a schedule to keep! It was 6:40pm when the truck finally rolled up in front of Ophelia's house. The neighbors peeked out from their curtains, but didn't pay the truck much mind. Friendly smiles and waves were exchanged with the neighbors by the two mothers. "Go on and knock on the door, Kaila," said Miya. "We'll start unloading the truck." Instructions given, ushering Kaila up to the door to knock. And when they did, a few moments of silence preceded one of the two double doors opening, revealing Ophelia. She was older now. She was mature. A full-grown adult. About half a head taller than Kaila. Ophelia's lips fell open just slightly. Her face softened. She smiled. She smiled brightly. "Oh, Kaila.." she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Then, in the next moment, Ophelia's arms were around Kaila in a tight hug.


Kaila
The week between graduation and moving day felt like the blink of an eye. Yet the day and a half spent traveling to Silvergate was excruciating. She loved her moms, sure, but the entire first day was spent with her head in her phone as the canadian backwoods passed them by. A few beautiful vistas or mountains on the way, sure, but Mikaila wasn't in a vacationing mood. Not even sleeping helped matters much; she felt like a kid again, bouncing her foot against the floor and fighting the urge to ask 'are we there yet'? Seeing the big Welcome to Silvergate was such a relief, but it was quickly replaced by a sudden spike of apprehension that followed her until they finally parked in front of Ophelia's house.

She's really moving out She may not see her parents for who knows how long. She's going to see big sis soon. It was a lot to take in.

Miya's voice broke the haze clouding her mind. "Huh? What?" Mikaila shook the cobwebs out and looked back at her mom. She mumbled a small 'right' and smiled as she was ushered to the door, waving at a passing neighbor and lugging the only bag not in storage up to the doorstep. Then, she stopped. Her heart skipped a beat. Knuckle-white fingers held the handle to her bag as she reached out and knocked. The doors opened and she saw Ophelia. Her breath caught in her lungs, she's still so tall. Kaila grinned. "Hey Effie. I'm here." Little Kaila the big crybaby grew up. So much has happened in the years since Ophelia moved away, so many changes and stresses, happy moments and regrets and things Mikaila didn't even want to get into. Yet when she laid her eyes on Ophelia, saw her in the flesh for the first time in forever, the tears just started welling. Her luggage bag slipped from her grip and thudded against the floor, but Kaila was too busy throwing her arms around Ophelia to care. Her hand squeezed Effie's shoulder. She leaned on her toes and pressed her chin to her shoulder. That big hug felt an eternity. Part of Kaila wished it was longer. "Oh God," Mikaila stumbled on her flats once they finally broke away. "I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry." She sniffled, giggled, then swiped the tears away with her jacket sleeve. "I'm just so happy to see you, like you don't even know." It was going to be tough pulling herself together, but at least she was able to pick her bag back up. Kaila could hear Yvette's voice in her head, chiding her in that light voice of hers: 'You could have broken something, you silly goose.' "Mom and Mum are unloading the truck right now," she said while biting her lip. "They should be coming up soon..." Then, Mikaila looked her big sis over again with another sniffle. "All these years and you're still the taller one huh?"


Sisterly Bliss
Ophelia placed a soft hand on Kaila's head when they made mention of her being taller. She giggled softly under her breath. "Yep, no getting away from being the little sister, Kaila." Her eyes were wet with tears, but her face screamed happiness. "It's okay if you cry. I'm crying too," she said, moving her hand from Kaila's head to rub at her eyes. She then sniffled. "All right. C'mon in," she said, opening the other door to leave them both open and usher Kaila in deeper into the house. "Just leave your suitcase by the door. I'll help mom and mum bring your stuff in. Once we get all the boxes in I can show you around the house. Help yourself to the fridge if you're thirsty," she said, slipping on some flip-flops to move out towards Miya and Yvette. Ophelia was always one to take the hardships away from Kaila. Never needed them to stress or work hard. But that was a long time ago. Kaila had the option of helping, or taking a load off, or maybe exploring around the house on their own if the desire possessed them.


Kaila
Kaila's cheeks ran red but she smiled even then. Her eyes were red, she was still sniffling but at least she wasn't alone. "God, you haven't changed at all Effie. Still tall, still pretty." It was true. Ophelia looked more mature but she still matched her memories. Kaila, meanwhile, looked like an entirely different girl. Her hazel eyes and her face still looked so Kaila, sure. But she grew up! She dyed her hair! Her smile felt so natural on her lips! "Alright! Lead the way, I'll follow ya." She lugged the bag inside and placed it by the door. Shuffljng in through the foyer and into the front room, Kaila turned to look back. Surprisingly, Kaila immediately waved the offer aside. "No way, there's too much stuff! Let me come help." She spent too much time in that dang van besides. Kaila needed to move, so she hopped out alongside Ophelia. Even if her help wasnt needed... it'd let Miyu and Yvette say hi to Effie. Gotta think about the family Kaila. Anyway, with all four of them, they'll have the boxes unloaded in a jiffy!


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:00pm] Ophelia gave a smile and a giggle at her little sister at the notion of being called pretty. "Oh, coming from you? Look at you! Ugh, you're all grown up!" Ophelia did take time to say hello to her two mothers. Hugs were had, and not a dry eye could be seen among them all. There were plenty of boxes to grab. Not a whole house's worth, but the entirety of what Kaila had wanted to bring with them. With Kaila working to help out, the boxes would be unloaded in just about twenty minutes. It would take more time to get it all downstairs, but the focus was getting things off the truck. As happy a reunion as it was, Miya and Yvette were not long for the visit. They had a vacation to get to! So once that was done, the two mot

hers were back on the road. They had to return the truck and take care of their own things; as long as the drive was for Kaila, it was twice as long for the two mothers. Ophelia did not seem keen on keeping them, but there was a tint of sadness in her eyes as she said goodbye. After nine years, twenty minutes wasn't much time face to face. But with that all done, Ophelia walked Kaila back into her home and closed the doors behind them. She kicked off her flip flops, sighing. "All right. Well. That's that. We'll have to take it down but there's no rush, right? Nothing in there that needs to go in a fridge or something right?" she asked, not expecting there to be anything that urgently had to unpack, but who knows? "Are you hungry? Thirsty?"


Kaila
There was an empty hollow feeling in her chest when it was time for Miya and Yvette to go. Her eyes were already wet when she hugged them for longer than she planned. Kaila's never gone longer than a week away from them. It felt odd when they were finally gone, but she distracted herself easily with the joy of reuniting with her big sister. She slid off her flats by the door. "Hm? Oh, no no. I didn't pack any perishables - other than some snacks in the bag I carried in anyhow." She sighed and ran her hands through her own hair. "Speaking of, I am a lil' hungry. Mind if we eat something first before you give me the grand tour?" Come to think of it Kaila didn't even give herself a chance chance check out the place. Her eyes wandered across the living room, padding a few steps in. Kaila whistled and cracked a smirk. "You got yourself a real nice place Effie, really really nice." The fact that their moms bought it was not lost on her. "I''ll be staying in the basement right? I hope it isn't too creepy down there."


Sisterly Bliss
Ophelia nodded, happy to leave the boxes to another time. Maybe tomorrow. Ophelia had rested a hand on Kaila's back while walking back in after seeing the difficulty of them saying goodbye. Reassurance was in great supply; that was certainly the same as it was all those years ago. "Hungry? All right, well, I wasn't sure when you were going to show up, so I didn't start prepping anything. So, how's about we order in tonight? A little bit of a delayed celebration for you graduating. This place has everything so, just tell me what you're hankering for. I know all the good spots," she said with a smile. "The basement isn't creeping, no. Fully carpeted, and the central air keeps it comfy. Promise I made it as comfy as could be for you. I would have given you something in the upper floor but, uh, as you'll see there's only one bedroom, so.." Ophelia rubbed the back of her head, flashing an awkward smile. "It's nice. I appreciate what mom and mum did for me, but they were pretty clear I was still going to have to pay them back every cent for the house," she said with a chuckle. "So let's sort out food," she said, moving to the living room to settle onto one of the two sofas. "Then after we eat we can get you acclimated and into a comfy bed. I've taken a week's vacation to help you settle in, starting today." Today was a Monday, after all. "Let's make sure to make the most of it, yeah?"


Kaila
Kaila felt a hand on her back and smiled. The empty feeling faded, filled by the familiar warmth of Ophelia. God shes missed this. "Sure! Tell me all your favorites sis. I"ll try not to break the bank tonight." She spun a lock for red-brown hair around her finger. Of course she celebrated her graduation but, cmon, they didn't really have lots of opportunities to do something huge. And besides... it wouldn't be the same without Ophelia anyway. "Oh I believe you," Mikaila reassured her sis. "That's fine, I don't need anything that fancy anyway. All I need is a space I can at least put all my clothes, put down all my books for the semester, my laptop, vanity mirror, you know. The standard stuff." Kaila flashed a toothy grin. "... I'd say I'd help pay "rent" but I know you'd refuse." There was like a million questions bubbling under the surface. Kaila wanted to know *everything*, but maybe food was a good first step. "How about pizza? Pizza's a total go-to." Kaila padded over to the sofa and joined Ophelia on the other side. "A whole week huh?" She stretched her legs out and crossed her ankles. "Your work must be pretty nice, if you can just take a whole week off." She said, her memories of bad retail part time haunting her like a jilted spirit. Kaila met Ophelia's gaze and smiled. "Yeah, let's make the most of it."
