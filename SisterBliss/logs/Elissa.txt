[June 20th, 6:40pm] It had been a big day. Elissa had graduated from high school and had only a week to rest. Miya and Yvette were working on their own plans, and it had been a week of packing and take-out; these plans were made about as last-minute as they came. Elissa's choice to let their mothers know they had gotten into Laurier University in a 'by the way' sort of manner so close to graduation had made for possibly the most chaotic week of Elissa's life. Everything Elissa wanted to take had to go in boxes. Of course, their bedroom would not need to be emptied entirely; a bed would always be there for Elissa if they ever needed to come back to live with mom & mom. But this was poised to be Elissa's new home for the next few years at least. It had been assured that Elissa wouldn't be shooed or sent out from Ophelia's home even after graduation from postsecondary. A supportive family all around. But then it was a full day and a half on the road. Hours on end, interrupted by stopping at truck stops, then a hotel for the night, then up again at 8am to get back on the road. Occasional stops for food, to stretch, but there was a schedule to keep! It was 6:40pm when the truck finally rolled up in front of Ophelia's house. The neighbors peeked out from their curtains, but didn't pay the truck much mind. Friendly smiles and waves were exchanged with the neighbors by the two mothers. "Go on and knock on the door, Elissa," said Miya. "We'll start unloading the truck." Instructions given, ushering Elissa up to the door to knock. And when they did, a few moments of silence preceded one of the two double doors opening, revealing Ophelia. She was older now. She was mature. A full-grown adult. About half a head taller than Elissa. Ophelia's lips fell open just slightly. Her face softened. She smiled. She smiled brightly. "Oh, Elissa.." she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Then, in the next moment, Ophelia's arms were around Elissa in a tight hug.


Elissa Frost 
It was strange, the actions that had precipitated this moment were of her own hand. They were premeditated even. She had spent long and hard working to this exact moment. Yet in the last two days she had felt just as hopelessly out of control of her own life as when Ophelia had left her in the first place. Everything moved so fast, too fast for her comfort. Though in all honestly the way she had been living just a single act of adulthood was enough to see her tapped out for the day and content to spend the rest of it in quiet isolation to rest. No such luck here, she hadn't done anything strenuous, save for packing it had been two days mostly just parked on her butt even as her entire world was shifted hundreds of miles away. But it was exhausting, not for travelling but for the fact she was fe

eling cold feet. She'd felt this the moment she had gotten that letter of acceptance. From then until now as she stood on the threshold of her new life she had been desperately looking for a stay of execution. Maybe Sis would change her mind. Maybe the car would break down. Maybe the university would call up and explain that it was just a practical joke and an idiot like her wasn't fit for them... She shook her head a little and tried to steady her breathing. Why? Why was she feeling this fear? This was what she wanted, what she had wanted for years now. The single unchanging thing in a whirlwind of emotions that was growing from a young girl to a young woman. Now finally it was in her grasp, and the change was scaring her. She wanted to go back to that unhappy status quo. She knew that. Yet sh

e couldn't, she wasn't in control here. After all what could she do? Say no and have mom drive her for two days back home. Can their holiday plans, hurt everyone's feelings? Her heart was beating uncomfortably hard, and breathing felt difficult. The knock was so weak that likely nobody would have heard it. Barely tapping her knuckles against the door. Then after an intimidatingly long silence that door opened to reveal her. She wanted to say she barely recognized her sister, she was taller, more mature certainly. But even if her memories where nearly a decade removed at this point it all still lined up. She was taller and more mature then as well, if anything the difference had shrunk instead, she'd caught up to only being half a head shorter rather than just half her full stop. Her own first w

ords were not so poetically beautiful. She had thought about what she wanted to say. She'd spent years doing so. She'd literally written a script of what she wanted her first words to be. The reality however. "H-hi..." The hug took her by surprise. Even up to now she had been second guessing if she was truly welcome here. But even her darker fears had little hope when the first thing she got was a hug. One not really reciprocated that well in spite of her desire, she was stiff as a board for a good half minute or so before she slowly reached up to hold her sister's arms... Don't cry, don't cry, you're going to look stupid if you start crying... Even her own body was moving out of her control now as she pressed her face in tight and gave a squeaky cough to try and mask her loss of composure.


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 6:45pm] Ophelia retreated from the hug somewhat with a look of concern on her features. She then smiled. Clear sympathy suffused her body language. She giggled briefly. "Hi yourself," said Ophelia back. One hand then moved to rest on top of Elissa's head. A few gentle strokes left and right. "Don't look so nervous. You look like you're about to have a heart attack. C'mon," she said, ushering Elissa into the home. It was clean. Smelled nice. Decently cool, which was pleasant when contrast against the mildly oppressive June heat outside. It was a hot and sunny day. Not ideal for moving heavy boxes. If no resistance was given, Elissa would then be sat on one of the couches in the living room. "I've got some stuff to chat about with mum and mom. You just take a minute for yourself, yeah? I know this is a big change for you. But we're here together, okay?" A smile. "Think about what you want for dinner!" she said, then stepped out of the front doors. Some loud cries of excited mom-ness resounded from outside as the two sisters' mothers let out years of anticipation for seeing Ophelia again in a single second that would if nothing else let all the neighbors know that they were there.


Elissa Frost
Even without a mirror she knew she didn't exactly look good. A week of barely sleeping paired with her usual reclusive nature probably made her look far more fragile than she was. Especially while trying and failing to not start crying. "I feel like I already am..." She tried her best to deliver it in deadpan, even forced a smile to let her know she wasn't being literal. The house certainly felt more modern than their parents; while it too was a lovely place, her sanctuary for so long, such a long time spent there with three people and space ever reserved for a fourth naturally led to some amount of clutter. Plus Ophelia had probably been cleaning extra hard just to make a first impression. "No, it's fine I should really..." Either way she was planted on the so

fa. Truth is much as she might want to help one look at her palms said it all. They were almost a blur for how shaky they were. This wasn't right. Ophelia wasn't some stranger, she was her sister. She'd been dying to see them in person again for years so why was she so freaked out? Taking a breath she closed her eyes and then slapped both palms to her cheeks as hard as she could... which did exactly nothing. Figures. In the end staring intently at the floor and focusing on her breathing helped more. She was still acutely aware of her surroundings. Her paranoia was being stubborn, spite of all this being done for her, in spite of the hug... and then even in spite of those happy cheers outside everyone was surely feeling as uncomfortable about this arrangement as

she was. That she had been selfish and was now intruding on her sister's life. That was not even factoring in school yet. Hell, how was she going to fake it through that? Leaning her head back she looked at the ceiling to see if it's wisdom was any better than the floor's. "I don't get it... aren't I supposed to be feeling better about this? I literally got what I wanted." She shook her head a little, bringing a hand up to dry her eyes. "...do I deserve it though?" That question scared her a little, shaking her head one last time. No, come on, be logical. Nobody would bend over backwards like this if they were against it. She repeated that logic back to herself a few times and... it helped, a little. She still felt overwhelmed but at least not in such a panic.

[June 20th, 7:15pm] While Elissa had their minor crisis in the living room, big sister and team mom duo worked at getting the boxes out of the truck and into the room just to the right of the entrance that housed the stairwell. Given that Elissa was told to keep their furniture behind, it was just personal effects that were coming along for the ride, including Elissa's computer and any other entertainment they chose to pack. A desk and television were already waiting for Elissa to settle in with, along with (hopefully) ample storage for their clothes in the way of two wardrobe cabinets. Snippets of conversation could be picked up from the other three as they worked, but it was mostly small talk. Ophelia had a good relationship with the two mothers of the sisters, but the elder sister leaving so long ago left the two mothers without enough knowledge to really connect with her. Ophelia was independent now. Her own person. The relationship was still good, but the distance had become more than physical in the years apart. All in all, it took a half hour to get everything moved into the home. The mothers were in a rush, however, so quick hugs and kisses were given to Elissa before they ran for the truck to get started on the drive back home; Ophelia did offer to have them for dinner, but dearest mom and mom were insistent they get a move on. That they get started on their vacation seemed like something they were beyond antsy to get in motion. So it was, Ophelia waved them off, then closed the door and put one hand on her hip as she looked at Elissa. "Phew. Well. They're chatty as ever, aren't they?" asked Ophelia with a smile.


Elissa Frost
The computer and clothing was certainly the most unwieldy things to carry in, the one blessing of a shut in daughter was that most of her belongings were digital in nature. So long as her big sister didn't mind a not-insignificant up tick in traffic she would be fine. Even for clothing she travelled light, while she had enough to always be in clean clothes it was clear that any flair for fashion she may have copied from Ophelia in years past had withered. They fit, they were neat, still broadly feminine but... dull. After all why bother dressing to impress if there was nobody to impress? There was no accessories, no jewellery. Nothing. The rest of the boxes beyond the trio that had her computer and clothing were while somewhat large light as a feather, and rattled. Her other primary hobby. Needless to say if Ophelia was curious to see her sister's talent that had gotten her moving five hundred miles across the country she'd have to wait. While a part of her was proud enough to want to bring those two life-changing creations that had gotten her here she wasn't confident they'd survive the journey. Nor was she confident Ophelia wouldn't just see her effort as dorkish. She knew her sister wasn't that cold, but still that unfounded fear was what saw them left behind to keep vigil in her old room. That and maybe spite for uprooting her comfortable routine. In less than an hour her entire life had been transplanted and her parents were out the door. It was... unnerving really. She had expected both moms to fuss more. After her sister had left she had become the sole outlet for such mothering, but now they seemed almost too eager to be gone. Not that her numbness to their affection helped. But both of them knew how their Lissy was, just shy. In truth it was simply excitement, the way mom and mom were acting it wasn't out of the question both sisters would get news of a third sibling within a couple weeks... But for Elissa she couldn't help but overanalyse and run it through her own pessimistic world view. She felt like she was a burden so clearly everyone else did too, right? With them gone now though the reality of her situation was just starting to set in. The smile wasn't met with one of her own however, she was much too nervous. "Uhm... you probably want to set ground rules and stuff yeah, now that you've gotta... deal... with me."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:18pm] Ophelia hadn't opened any of the boxes, naturally. It was best to keep them all in the boxes to move them into the basement where Elissa would be living before unpacking. Plenty of room down, as Elissa would see, to store everything. Ophelia tilted her head slightly at Elissa's words. A look of mild confusion rest on her features. She responded by walking over to Elissa and very gently flicking them on the forehead. "Ground rule number one: nobody talks bad about my little sister. Especially not my little sister," she said, keeping that warm smile about her. "Seriously. I'm excited you're here. It's nice to have family here with me," she went on to say, keeping close but out of flick distance. "I know that it might not seem like it so much, since it's been so long and I haven't even managed a visit in person in all this time," she said, remorse clear in her voice. "But I missed you, Lissy."


Elissa Frost
"Ah..." The flick didn't hurt, merely took her by surprise as she reached up to touch her forehead and given that first rule. Likely the one she'd break the most often, it was the habit of a lifetime after all. The reassurance was nice though and while her smile in response was a bit forced she did look calmer for hearing that. "I'm glad..." The lilt in her voice did suggest she had intended to say more. But she was at least trying to observe that rule. Instead shaking her head a little at her sister's apology for not being around. "Mhnn. No, I understand. Mom and mom do too. You had an opportunity and you took it, like you should have." Once again she found herself looking at her feet instead of whom she was talking to. She knew it was a bad habit. "I missed you too. I've been... trying to get to this point for at least four years now. Back when we learnt you were staying here and not going back. I thought if you wouldn't come back then I could follow you instead, I mean how hard could it be right?" Well they both knew how hard at this point, she'd forced herself to become a straight A student practically overnight. "I didn't think the uni would actually accept me though... even now it barely feels real."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:20pm] Ophelia took a seat on the arm of the adjacent couch; Elissa sitting on the one parallel to the outside wall allowed them to remain close as she took this pose. She wore sympathy on her features. "Doesn't mean it wasn't still a difficult decision despite being the one I knew I had to take. It's been lonely," she said, offering a sympathetic upturn of her brow. "It only got worse when school turned into a good job here. But, I'm not surprised at all that you got accepted." She smiled. "That's my little Lissy. Always capable of a hundred billion gajillion times more than you'll ever believe, eh? But!" she slapped her thighs. "You got in! So, tonight is your night. Time to celebrate. Which meaaaannnnns you get to pick dinner tonight. And I have a small surprise for you after dinner, too." She winked and wore a smile. "And I swear if you tell me 'I don't know' or 'whatever you want is fine' to what you want I'm gonna flick you again." Still smiling, a little more playful now.

Elissa Frost
She did perk a brow when her sister sat on the arm of the couch. She had assumed they'd be more... house-proud? At least mom always was about sitting in the couch properly. Though she remembered Ophelia had been like this before she had left. It really was her. Their parents might not have recognized them as much now but... it was like not a day had passed. They'd just gotten older. "I think you're the only one who isn't. I just applied on a whim, I didn't think they'd call back. It's why everyone was in such a rush." The guilt was evident in her voice, as much as everyone wanted to celebrate she did feel bad about causing such disruption. She was used to just fading into the background. Being told tonight was her night, that there was a surprise for her she just gave a weak shake of her head. "You didn't need to go that far. You're already letting me stay." Ophelia already anticipating her responses earned slight blush. "Uh... whatever... you'd have were I not coming over?" She quickly held up her hands to signify that this wasn't actually her answer. "Uh..." Why'd they have to put her on the spot like that? She was used to just eating whatever was put in front of her. "...curry? Maybe?" Curry was easy to make, right?


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:22pm] Ophelia's face turned to one that said very loudly 'I'm going to shake you' in the most playful way while Elissa was answering. "I want you here, you dork. It's really no trouble. It's the opposite." She shook her head with a small laugh. "Seriously, you're making me feel like I'm a stranger. I'm your big sister! Jeez." Another laugh. "You don't get to worm your way out of answering this one. I'll be picking what we have plenty in our time together, to make sure you're getting good food and not just subsisting off ramen noodles and perpetuating the university student stereotype. So if you need a minute to think about it, that's cool. Though I should be clear I'm not cooking tonight. We're uh, we're gonna order in, we've got enough work getting you all situated so someone else can do the cooking. And if you are even thinking about pitching in for it I will strike you down with righteous fury. You're gonna let your big sister spoil you tonight and you are going. To. Like. It."


Elissa Frost
"I'm sorry..." Though before any shaking could happen she quickly followed it up. "I'm n-not really that good with anyone nowadays. Not even our moms really. I tend to text them if I need to say much." This was probably the most she had said in a month, Ophelia might not had felt it but this was amazingly chatty for her. "I don't mean to make things awkward it's just... kinda how I am now." Nine years was a long time after all and she'd fallen pretty far in that time. At the reassurance they were just ordering rather than cooking though she did relax a bit and choose more freely. "I can cook more than just noodles. I can do eggs too..." A moment of consideration and she gave a nod. "A-alright. I don't really have much money anyway. Uh... if we're having take-out then ...chinese? Just chow mein is fine." She was still erring on the side of caution picking something "safe" as if it actually mattered what she chose. But it was probably the closest thing her sister was going to get to a confident answer. At least at this stage. Ophelia might not have seemed any different to how she remembered her but that likely wasn't mutual. 'Lissy had always took after her sister a lot back when they both lived together, but she had always had a much greater, larger than life, presence then. Hard to imagine someone so boisterous and demanding had become the shy woman now who could barely hold a conversation. "Thank you. Sis. I have dreamed of being able to see you again."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:24pm] Ophelia smiled. "Chinese then," she echoed with a nod. "We're gonna get more than that though, Chinese is good for leftovers, so it's no big deal if we get more than we can eat, which is usually how it goes, eh?" she chuckled, then paused. She studied Elissa for a moment or two. "You're not just asleep in the car and dreaming though. Promise." She rose from the arm of the couch to wander over to the kitchen. "Where the hell did I...Oh, there it is," she muttered from the kitchen, having found her phone mid-mutter to return back to Elissa. She pulled up the website of the Mandarin restaurant for delivery and handed it to Elissa. Her phone was a very recent model with an attractive blue case with a snowy pattern on the back. A small crack in the corner of the case made it easy to assume the phone had tumbled and survived its share of drops despite being recent. But cases were made to be broken, so the phone didn't. "Better see you put more than just chow mein in," she said, winking. "Seriously. Go ham. Worst case we go into food comas and deal with unpacking tomorrow, eheh."


Elissa Frost
	"Doesn't it go all greasy and gross after?" She had tried reheating some in the microwave before, and gotten horribly sick from it. But then she was a disaster in the kitchen. "I'm kinda surprised, I figured you'd be like 'this is all poison and I won't have it in my house' ...or something." She wasn't really sure why she assumed her sister to be strict, they had never been like that years back. Being handed the phone she looked it over briefly. "It's pretty." Her own was not, a bulky Frankenstein of a phone that looked like it had been thrown in a dryer alongside a bag of gravel. It was an old hand-me-down from when she was little and rather than let it die with dignity and ask for a new one she had instead stubbornly kept it alive. Replacing the screen and battery with third party knock off versions on her own. Not that Ophelia needed to see such a monster, she knew what they'd likely do. That said she handled one a decade more modern with ease and made her order. As demanded she did put more in. Replacing her initial request with instead one portion of Singapore noodles, special fried rice and some prawn crackers. She... really did not think she'd be able to eat even half of this. Heck just two thirds of the noodles alone would probably be enough. She was a sedentary girl. But they told her to go ham and so this very conservative hamming was the result. "Okay, here." She handed the phone back. "There's not really much to unpack really. Just clothes."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:30pm] Ophelia shook her head. "Trick is to add a bit of water to noodles when reheating them in the pan," she said with a double-tap on her own nose. And actually using a pan, not that she knew Elissa was a microwave-only sort of disaster. Only one of them needed to be good at cooking, thankfully. "Oh, thanks. I like the case, but I keep dropping it so I have been meaning to get another one. Just glad the screen hasn't cracked yet." She accepted the phone back when they were done, pleased to see them having added more. "Well, I did tell mom and mum not to bother with furniture. I picked out a nice L desk and some wardrobes for you and got a new television mounted down there. Naturally that was a problem that was best solved by paying the men who move the stuff to do it for me, because if I picked up a power drill to try and mount the television god knows I'd end up with the wall looking like someone took a shotgun to it." For all Ophelia was good at, it seemed being a handyman was not one of them. Thankfully, there had proven to be a magical thing called money that worked well for getting skilled tradesmen to do things properly. Ophelia was focused on the screen for a bit before placing the order. "Of course it didn't remember my card," she muttered with an eyeroll. "Pay on delivery then, fine, place order," she continued to mutter to herself as she completed the task. "All right, that's done. Usually takes them like an hour or so. So, hope you're not too starving yet. What's say I give you the tour while we wait? Unless you'd rather just put something on the TV and chat?"


Elissa Frost
"Huh..." Well if she wasn't forewarned she'd learn soon enough just how incapable Lissy was with cooking. Clearly when it came to genetics she had taken after the mom who also couldn't cook to save their life. At the mention of a crack she hesitated in handing the phone back to instead turn it over so she could better look at the case, and the damage. She simply held it there staring in silence for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time before turning her attention back to her sister. "I could probably repair that once I've unpacked properly..." Unlike her previous could bes and probablys this one actually sounded like it was coming from a place of informed confidence. The same could not be said for the notion Ophelia had spent a small fortune on her before she had even arrived. "I'd have been happy with just a futon..." Admittedly while she knew her sister had a "good" job she had no idea what "good" actually meant, and how well off she may or may not have been. Lissy herself had never held a job in her life and while her parents had provided her with spending money she tended to avoid actually spending it out of guilt. She'd become adept at making practically nothing go way further than it should instead. "Uhm, I'm fine waiting. Mom kinda kept force feeding me snacks on the trip anyway." As for what they were supposed to do while waiting she opened her mouth to reflexively say 'whatever you want'. But she caught herself before she could do that instead giving a nod. "Wha- uh... yeah, a tour sounds good. Thanks."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:35pm] Ophelia tilted her head slightly at the offer. "Oh? Well, I do like this one, and I don't know if I'd be able to find another copy, so I'd really enjoy it if you could repair it," she said, her smile brightening with genuine pride in her little sister. Time would tell how much they would actually be able to follow up on their claims, but it was an exciting prospect. She then rolled her eyes. "Just a futon...Ugh, you wound me," she said with a giggle. "As if I'd let you sleep like that. No no, you've got a proper memory foam mattress and some fresh bamboo sheets. You'll love them," she said with an encouraging lilt. Good job apparently meant very good, or at least proved that Ophelia was smart with her money. She nodded to the notion that Elissa was fine with the wait. Then rose a brow when thanked for the tour. "...Thanks?" She sighed. "This is your house too now, you know." Maybe not legally so, but sentimentally so was clearly intended. "You don't have to be so formal about it. C'mon, let's start with the kitchen," she said, nudging with her head to move to said kitchen. As expected, the stove and counters were spotless, with some appliances - a coffee maker, a microwave, a toaster, a panini press, and a blender - currently out and taking up counter space in an organized way alongside a very pretty and ornate black knife block which sported a sleek silver trim and housed a myriad of knives (and a pair of scissors) safely and neatly. Enough room for the cutting board that was neatly slotted under one of the overhead cabinets in a plastic sheathe that was mounted to the underside, for plates, and a fair amount of other clutter before it became crowded. The electric oven looked state of the art with a fume hood sitting over top. Not a spec of grease or foodstuff. The fridge, similarly, was very nice. Ophelia went and opened each of the overhead cupboards, showing where the plates, bowls, mugs, glasses, and the rest all were. "Most of the stuff you'd be looking for will be here. Snacks and stuff are over in this cupboard. Frozen dinners for lazy days in the freezer, with some more in the deep freeze in the basement. Plenty of room for drinks in the fridge, though I try to keep a variety. Extras go downstairs on the shelves, so if there's a drink you want but there's no cold ones you can use the ice maker on the fridge door," she said, pointing to the device in question. "Just uh, if you're gonna use the cooking knives, be really careful, okay? They are uh...Extremely sharp. They were a parting gift from the chef I was apprenticing under when I moved on to working in the restaurant I'm in now, and uh, yeah. The steak knives on the bottom row are you average kind of sharp, but the ones in the top section are all something I'd not really want you using without me being there to supervise. Not because I think you're accident prone or something, but they are 'call 911 immediately' kind of sharp."


Elissa Frost
She gave a nod. "It might not look like new but it shouldn't be too hard." Time would tell indeed though given it was so far the only thing she had shown confidence in there was good promise there. "Bamboo?" Wasn't that like... made of wood or something? Clearly she had no idea and then at the gentle scolding for being so stiff she, predictably, apologized. "Sorry... uh. I mean... sorry. I'll try and remember that." Time would again tell if she'd actually allow herself to feel at home and not act like she was in a prison. The kitchen was as to be expected of someone whom cooked for a living, spacious and impressive. Far bigger than the small kitchen back home. Nice as that place was it was also an old town house and no amount of careful interior design could make up for new builds simply having twice the space to work with. All spotless, sleek and modern. She did appreciate being shown where everything was too, though rather than remembering where drinks and snacks were it was where all the plates and pots lived. This was supposed to be her home, Ophelia said as much so she was absolutely going to pitch in with the housework if not with the rent. Even if her big sister objected, well there weren't enough hours in the day to pre-empt all of her little sister's attempts to be useful. "I'll be careful, promise." Given three of her fingers on her right hand were wearing band aids and another two on her left? Lissy seemed to have a more broad idea of what careful meant. Her hobby knives were probably just as sharp, and paired with fiddly work did see her slicing her fingers pretty often. Usually not noticing until she had started bleeding on her work that she'd done it. "...I'm kinda surprised you live on your own actually. You're pretty, and smart. I figured you'd already be y'know... married or something."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:45pm] Ophelia gave a smile when Lissy promised to be careful. "If it's as careful as with whatever gave you those bandages I'll still want to keep an eye out," she said with a giggle. The notion of being married evoked a bright blush from the elder sister along with some brief wide eyes, then a look to the side. "A-Ahah, well. Uh. You're gonna start sounding like our moms if you go saying things like that," she said, awkwardly chuckling. "But, well, y'know...Just hasn't been in the cards I guess. Restaurant work is busy sometimes. It's not like I haven't dated here and there, there just wasn't any spark. Plus, well, with some guys they get all excited that you can cook and it gets into their ego that they'll have a professional chef stay-at-home wife or something and their lizard brains turn on and--" She cut herself off, shaking her head. "The right person is out there somewhere, Lissy. For both of us. There's no rush, eh?" She smiled. "What about you, huh? Have any hot dates in school, maybe a long distance boyfriend I should know about?" She smirked lightly and leaned forward, arms crossed over her abdomen, seemingly intent on flipping the script on her little sister.


Elissa Frost
She blinked a little at the notion of bandages before she looked down at her own hands. "Oh..." She then peeled one off, it had been a couple days on the road and more since she had sliced her fingers. Those wounds were healed though without the bandaid it revealed a number of thin white lines criss-crossing the same parts of her fingers. Needless to say it was likely a common occurrence. The topic of being married earning a blush did come as a surprise as she canted her head. It was pretty unusual to see her sister be shy or bashful, at least based on her limited perception of her. Ophelia had left long before that sort of topic got bandied about after all. She just guessed her sister was confident in all things at all times. Their phone calls never went beyond pleasantries and checking in either. A lot of what Ophelia blurted out went over her head. Lizard brains? Did they turn all mean and nasty or something? A troubled expression crossed her face, only worsening as the notion of there being someone for her was brought up. She expected the question to be flipped back on her. Her gaze falling to the ground as she turned her head to the side, one hand holding her arm. "I don't have anyone, not even friends. I haven't for a few years now. There's a few people I talk to besides our moms, but that's mostly just people being polite y'know?" Ophelia might have intended for her little gesture to be just playful teasing but for her sister it felt judgemental. It wasn't as if their parents had simply left Elissa's social reclusion alone, but they were as much at a loss of how to help that as she was at making friends. "Sorry... kinda lame huh?"


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:47pm] Ophelia's expression softened. She kept a smile about her and walked over to her little sister to stand beside them and pull them into a side hug. "Hey, high school is for chumps anyway," she said while looking at her little sister from the side. "You'll find a lot more people in your element in university. People are less stupid there. More mature. Generally speaking," she said with a chuckle. "But honestly? The best friends you'll make will be beyond that, too, usually. People you meet at work and stuff. I don't talk to anyone from high school, and maybe one or two people from university days. Life can be messy, and sometimes it takes you away from the people you care about," she said, the tone making it clear this was at least partially about the two of them. "The people who really matter stay in touch, and are always there to welcome you with open arms. So until you are the most popular girl in the whole school and are batting away suitors with a stick? You've got your big sis here for you, and I'm not going anywhere this time, got me?" Another smile. "I'm here for you, Lissy. For the long haul. We're gonna have a lot of fun together."


Elissa Frost
Her self pity was broken by that hug, going tense for a moment before a heavy exhale left her and she squeezed back. "My element is in my room or on the internet, I'm not sure I want people there." Though the mention of people being more mature and less stupid did have her head pulling away from her sister. "I thought you were trying to reassure me, I need people on my level." When her sister started talking about her own relationship she squeezed once more. "You realize what you're saying right? Because if you promise that I'm going to hold you to it." Still it helped her feel better, no doubt eventually they would have to part again. Her sister had her own life to live after all and there likely was not going to be room in there for a clingy sister. But for now at least she could live in the moment once more. "Thanks, sis. I think I'll be alright. Long as I have you..." A long pause followed then she spoke up once more. Albeit with a quieter volume, still legible but barely above a whisper. "...Just don't put me ahead of yourself."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:49pm] Ophelia giggled. "Goofball," was her response to Elissa's 'people on my level' comment. "I know what I'm saying," she said, then moved to stand in front of Elissa again. She took both of her little sister's hands and squeezed them. "Listen. I know it was hard," she said, closing her eyes. "I'm sorry. And if I could do it again, I'd do more to find time to visit in person. That's easy to say in retrospect of course but...What I'm saying is of all the things that I gained for what I had to do, I never wanted it to come at a cost of being separated from you. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do," she said, eyes opening again to look at Lissy. There was sorrow in those eyes. "You've got me, okay? I'm gonna make it all up to you."


Elissa Frost
She listened to them in silence, she knew it wasn't as if they wanted to leave her. Even if occasionally a voice in the back of her head suggested such. There had been Christmases, birthdays, where she was upset that all she had was a phone call. But at the same time it was always impossible to be unhappy in the moment. At least they were still there, at least she could hear their voice. At that final comment, of making it back up to her she pulled one hand away. Bringing it up to cup her sister's cheek instead as she shook her head. "Don't." She forced a smile. "You chased your dream. There's nothing there to make up for. I'd feel a hundred times worse if I felt like I had held you back from all this." She glanced around at the immaculate kitchen, the rest of the ground floor of this spacious and modern house in a nice neighbourhood. Ophelia had done better for herself than many people her age. A lot better. "You're happy where you ended up right? Then it was the right choice."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:50pm] Ophelia wore mild surprise on her face at the cupping of her cheek. She didn't resist. She eased into the touch, closing her eyes again. Relief seemed to wash over her in the wake of the understanding words given. "Wish I could have taken you along," she said quietly with a smile. There was regret on her face, some silent inference that she could have done better. "Well. It's all in the past now, right? So we'll just focus on making things great." A smile followed. "There's not much else to this floor, besides the dining room there I guess," she said, gesturing to the dining room behind Elissa. "So uh, care to continue the tour? Basement and your room is down through that door," she said, pointing to the door in the corner of the dining room. "Upstairs is the master bath and my room. Still got like a half hour before the food shows up I'd say."


Elissa Frost
She felt a sense of relief too, much as she had hurt for these last few years she did genuinely want the best for the sister even if this did come at the expense of herself. That was fine after all, she was a loser. Ophelia always held all of their parent's hopes and expectations. That's what she'd been telling herself for so long just to cope with her own feeling of indolence. With the mention of resuming the tour she then remembered where she was touching as she quickly pulled her hand back as if Ophelia's cheek was scalding hot. Holding her hand close to her chest as her cheeks almost matched her hair. "Ahh... haha... yeah, we could do that, yeah." Rubbing the back of her head she looked over at the stairs that led up before flicking her gaze back to her sister. She was curious but... "Well I probably shouldn't be rooting around in your space anyway, so uh... downstairs? I do have some stuff to unpack after all."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:52pm] Ophelia giggled at Elissa's actions, then nudged with her head. "All right, we'll bring some boxes down then since we're heading down." She moved over to the door in the corner of the dining room and pulled on it to open it. The door did not have a lock, and there was a rubber stopper installed on the adjacent wall to catch the door in the event it was slammed open so it wouldn't punch a hole in the wall. With the door left open, she moved over to the entrance to grab one of the heavier boxes of clothes. Not too much for her to heft, but enough that it was a one box sort of trip. She moved with Elissa in tow down the sturdy stairs to the basement. It was a bit cooler in the basement, which was nice given the oppressive heat of the current weather. In the basement, a deep freeze lined the immediate wall across from the stairs, next to the door to Elissa's room. Circling back around from the direction of the stairs would give a

view of the storage racks that had been set up. Simple wood slats with metal bars for the skeleton of the racks, upon which all manner of odds and ends had been left. From dry foods to some power tools to cleaners, this seemed to be where everything that didn't fit somewhere else was stored. Ophelia nudged with her head towards the door. She opened it with some minor difficulty while holding the box as well, revealing Elissa's room. This door did have a simple lock on the doorknob for the girl's privacy. Not something that couldn't be easily broken if needed, but enough to stop the knob from turning and let outsiders know that Elissa was not to be disturbed. The room had a bed, the promised L-shape desk in the corner, a large dresser, a nice television set up and mounted to the wall beside the door, with an entertainment center below, both out of the way of the swing of the door, a nightstand by the bed, and two wardrobe cabinets to work with. The be

d had simple white sheets and bedding, with an abundance of pillows at the headboard. It was a nice bed. Not a simple, cheap thing that one could acquire hastily. Something that one would bring with them when moving. Solid hardwood on the head and footboards along with the frame. The mattress, if sat or laid on, proved to be a luxurious memory foam that was still firm enough to provide ample support and avoid any weird sleep pains. Ophelia set the box down on the hardwood flooring. "Phew. Well, this is it. This is yours. The furniture doesn't quite match, wasn't a whole set for what I wanted to get in here, but it's all white, and has the sort of finish that would let us paint them sometime if you wanted, which I figured would be good enough. Uh. But also this was just kinda the basics, n' stuff. I wanted you to have room for whatever you were bringing, but it's definitely got room to be more fully furnished if you can think of other stuff you want."


Elissa Frost
She did want to be the one to shoulder the heavier of the boxes, even if most of them were not really all that heavy. Even without packing light Lissy simply had not an awful lot of things. She was pretty unplugged from reality. She made up for it by grabbing a triple stack of boxes that, while light did almost cover her face even with holding them below her waistline. Admittedly a somewhat precarious journey given they were going down stairs as well but she managed without tripping and falling. "Guess I'm a basement dweller now huh?" Hopefully her sister took it as the ribbing at herself it was meant to be and not a complaint about her accommodation. She was serious when she said she'd have been fine with a futon in the garage. Apparently not all of the basement was hers however, prior to this being converted to a room it was clearly a sort of dumping ground. "Huh, it's a room in

side of the basement then?" There was a little bit of surprise in her voice. "Mhn that works actually. I can probably do airbrushing and stuff out here rather than worry about the floor in my room." Opening it up? Well it was nothing short of an upgrade, even if Ophelia considered it spartan. Her room back home had been rather pokey, she had been given the option several times to move into Ophelia's old room in her place and get some more space. But she somewhat enjoyed the cramped feeling, not to mention that with her sister's old room left always in a state where she could move right back in the next day she did enjoy going in there just to sit and pretend her sibling was simply away on an errand and not half a country away. No such coping was needed now, so maybe she could stretch her wings a little? Or at least build this small army of plastic she had been amassing without a place

to put them. One of the boxes she was holding was from Christmas. That desk already proving it's worth as she dumped her own boxes on that instead of her usual delivery spot of either on the bed or on the floor; the biggest of shelves. "This feels way more than just the basics. Just the basics would be a bed and maybe a shelf. Not..." She gestured around wildly. "...all of this!" She let her arms flop down again as she paced around the room tentatively, her room. This felt way too welcoming, far nicer than she deserved for forcing herself back into her sister's life. Eventually sitting down on the bed and loosing a slight sound of surprise at the softness. Her old mattress had been starting to get pretty hard and uncomfortable, though she had kept silent about it to not be a bother. "Thank you, Sis. This is... way too much. But thank you. Really. I'll make this up to you, somehow."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:00pm] Ophelia met their response with a chuckle. "I thought we weren't about making anything up to each other?" she asked with a playful tilt of her head, arms folded over her chest. "This room used to be kinda just an extra room. I think it was supposed to be like an office space?" She shrugged. "It's really nothing. Mom and mum helped out with the funds for this." Helped out, not took care of, notably. "I don't really think it's too much. And I did say there was more to come didn't I? Like, if you need anything. Whatever you're going to school for is probably gonna need us to move this all around and get you a working space if it's more than just needing your desk and computer stuff." She paused, tapping at her lower lip. "What was that again? Mom and mum were so over the top yelling about how much needed to get done they never answered me on what program you got accepted to."


Elissa Frost
"I know but still. I feel like I need to. Just let me help in my own way yeah?" As for extras this place needed she scratched her cheek. "I'm not really sure what more I could need... I'm not just saying that either. I literally can't think of anything. I uh... have no idea what I'm even doing." At the mention of Ophelia not even knowing what course she was on Lissy just blinked a little in surprise. "Geez. Y'know they were like, all over each other on the way here too. I thought Miya was gonna cause an accident the way she kept squeezing Yvette's thigh..." She tailed off with a shake of her head and more pink cheeks. "...I've never felt so awkward in a hotel room before." Of course she was happy that her parents were still in love. But that didn't mean she couldn't feel embarrassed with them gushing over each other. Oh, right her course. She glanced to the side for a moment briefly considering if she could also evade answering that question, because she knew right where this was going. She'd tell them and then they'd want to see the work that got her accepted. Gawd, where was that takeout delivery to save her from this? "Uhh... m-media. Media and film production. Mostly, like, special effects and stuff." It was mumbled more to the floor than to her sister. "I recorded something with my gunpla and sent it to the uni. I didn't think they'd call back and invite me to enrol on their course..."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:02pm] Ophelia gave her little sister a look. The sort of look that was chiding them in the most gentle way. "I'm gonna beat you up if you keep on with double standards," she said with a giggle and a little smirk, then shook her head. "Oh I believe it. They've always been dramatic. Can't take them anywhere. Not without getting super embarrassed by all the gushing." She smiled. "But it's only gross 'cause they're our moms, y'know? That sorta romance would be sooooo cute anywhere else. I've gotten less embarrassed about it with time, but, well, that might just be from not being exposed to it for so long. Being in a hotel room with them though? Eeessh. Yeah. I don't envy that," she said with a more full laugh. The talk about the course had her perking up. "Oh? Special effects? Gonna be blowing up cars in hollywood, eh?" Another smile. "That's really cool though. We'll have to get you set up with all the fancy camera equipment when we can. I have a DSLR and a few lenses that I used for some promo material and helping with the menu at the place I'm working. My work subsidized that one so it didn't bite the wallet quite as hard. But yeah! I got a tripod, uh, somewhere for it, too. All yours if you need it." She smiled. "What's a gunpla?"
