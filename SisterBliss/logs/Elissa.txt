[June 20th, 6:40pm] It had been a big day. Elissa had graduated from high school and had only a week to rest. Miya and Yvette were working on their own plans, and it had been a week of packing and take-out; these plans were made about as last-minute as they came. Elissa's choice to let their mothers know they had gotten into Laurier University in a 'by the way' sort of manner so close to graduation had made for possibly the most chaotic week of Elissa's life. Everything Elissa wanted to take had to go in boxes. Of course, their bedroom would not need to be emptied entirely; a bed would always be there for Elissa if they ever needed to come back to live with mom & mom. But this was poised to be Elissa's new home for the next few years at least. It had been assured that Elissa wouldn't be shooed or sent out from Ophelia's home even after graduation from postsecondary. A supportive family all around. But then it was a full day and a half on the road. Hours on end, interrupted by stopping at truck stops, then a hotel for the night, then up again at 8am to get back on the road. Occasional stops for food, to stretch, but there was a schedule to keep! It was 6:40pm when the truck finally rolled up in front of Ophelia's house. The neighbors peeked out from their curtains, but didn't pay the truck much mind. Friendly smiles and waves were exchanged with the neighbors by the two mothers. "Go on and knock on the door, Elissa," said Miya. "We'll start unloading the truck." Instructions given, ushering Elissa up to the door to knock. And when they did, a few moments of silence preceded one of the two double doors opening, revealing Ophelia. She was older now. She was mature. A full-grown adult. About half a head taller than Elissa. Ophelia's lips fell open just slightly. Her face softened. She smiled. She smiled brightly. "Oh, Elissa.." she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Then, in the next moment, Ophelia's arms were around Elissa in a tight hug.


Elissa Frost 
It was strange, the actions that had precipitated this moment were of her own hand. They were premeditated even. She had spent long and hard working to this exact moment. Yet in the last two days she had felt just as hopelessly out of control of her own life as when Ophelia had left her in the first place. Everything moved so fast, too fast for her comfort. Though in all honestly the way she had been living just a single act of adulthood was enough to see her tapped out for the day and content to spend the rest of it in quiet isolation to rest. No such luck here, she hadn't done anything strenuous, save for packing it had been two days mostly just parked on her butt even as her entire world was shifted hundreds of miles away. But it was exhausting, not for travelling but for the fact she was fe

eling cold feet. She'd felt this the moment she had gotten that letter of acceptance. From then until now as she stood on the threshold of her new life she had been desperately looking for a stay of execution. Maybe Sis would change her mind. Maybe the car would break down. Maybe the university would call up and explain that it was just a practical joke and an idiot like her wasn't fit for them... She shook her head a little and tried to steady her breathing. Why? Why was she feeling this fear? This was what she wanted, what she had wanted for years now. The single unchanging thing in a whirlwind of emotions that was growing from a young girl to a young woman. Now finally it was in her grasp, and the change was scaring her. She wanted to go back to that unhappy status quo. She knew that. Yet sh

e couldn't, she wasn't in control here. After all what could she do? Say no and have mom drive her for two days back home. Can their holiday plans, hurt everyone's feelings? Her heart was beating uncomfortably hard, and breathing felt difficult. The knock was so weak that likely nobody would have heard it. Barely tapping her knuckles against the door. Then after an intimidatingly long silence that door opened to reveal her. She wanted to say she barely recognized her sister, she was taller, more mature certainly. But even if her memories where nearly a decade removed at this point it all still lined up. She was taller and more mature then as well, if anything the difference had shrunk instead, she'd caught up to only being half a head shorter rather than just half her full stop. Her own first w

ords were not so poetically beautiful. She had thought about what she wanted to say. She'd spent years doing so. She'd literally written a script of what she wanted her first words to be. The reality however. "H-hi..." The hug took her by surprise. Even up to now she had been second guessing if she was truly welcome here. But even her darker fears had little hope when the first thing she got was a hug. One not really reciprocated that well in spite of her desire, she was stiff as a board for a good half minute or so before she slowly reached up to hold her sister's arms... Don't cry, don't cry, you're going to look stupid if you start crying... Even her own body was moving out of her control now as she pressed her face in tight and gave a squeaky cough to try and mask her loss of composure.


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 6:45pm] Ophelia retreated from the hug somewhat with a look of concern on her features. She then smiled. Clear sympathy suffused her body language. She giggled briefly. "Hi yourself," said Ophelia back. One hand then moved to rest on top of Elissa's head. A few gentle strokes left and right. "Don't look so nervous. You look like you're about to have a heart attack. C'mon," she said, ushering Elissa into the home. It was clean. Smelled nice. Decently cool, which was pleasant when contrast against the mildly oppressive June heat outside. It was a hot and sunny day. Not ideal for moving heavy boxes. If no resistance was given, Elissa would then be sat on one of the couches in the living room. "I've got some stuff to chat about with mum and mom. You just take a minute for yourself, yeah? I know this is a big change for you. But we're here together, okay?" A smile. "Think about what you want for dinner!" she said, then stepped out of the front doors. Some loud cries of excited mom-ness resounded from outside as the two sisters' mothers let out years of anticipation for seeing Ophelia again in a single second that would if nothing else let all the neighbors know that they were there.


Elissa Frost
Even without a mirror she knew she didn't exactly look good. A week of barely sleeping paired with her usual reclusive nature probably made her look far more fragile than she was. Especially while trying and failing to not start crying. "I feel like I already am..." She tried her best to deliver it in deadpan, even forced a smile to let her know she wasn't being literal. The house certainly felt more modern than their parents; while it too was a lovely place, her sanctuary for so long, such a long time spent there with three people and space ever reserved for a fourth naturally led to some amount of clutter. Plus Ophelia had probably been cleaning extra hard just to make a first impression. "No, it's fine I should really..." Either way she was planted on the so

fa. Truth is much as she might want to help one look at her palms said it all. They were almost a blur for how shaky they were. This wasn't right. Ophelia wasn't some stranger, she was her sister. She'd been dying to see them in person again for years so why was she so freaked out? Taking a breath she closed her eyes and then slapped both palms to her cheeks as hard as she could... which did exactly nothing. Figures. In the end staring intently at the floor and focusing on her breathing helped more. She was still acutely aware of her surroundings. Her paranoia was being stubborn, spite of all this being done for her, in spite of the hug... and then even in spite of those happy cheers outside everyone was surely feeling as uncomfortable about this arrangement as

she was. That she had been selfish and was now intruding on her sister's life. That was not even factoring in school yet. Hell, how was she going to fake it through that? Leaning her head back she looked at the ceiling to see if it's wisdom was any better than the floor's. "I don't get it... aren't I supposed to be feeling better about this? I literally got what I wanted." She shook her head a little, bringing a hand up to dry her eyes. "...do I deserve it though?" That question scared her a little, shaking her head one last time. No, come on, be logical. Nobody would bend over backwards like this if they were against it. She repeated that logic back to herself a few times and... it helped, a little. She still felt overwhelmed but at least not in such a panic.

[June 20th, 7:15pm] While Elissa had their minor crisis in the living room, big sister and team mom duo worked at getting the boxes out of the truck and into the room just to the right of the entrance that housed the stairwell. Given that Elissa was told to keep their furniture behind, it was just personal effects that were coming along for the ride, including Elissa's computer and any other entertainment they chose to pack. A desk and television were already waiting for Elissa to settle in with, along with (hopefully) ample storage for their clothes in the way of two wardrobe cabinets. Snippets of conversation could be picked up from the other three as they worked, but it was mostly small talk. Ophelia had a good relationship with the two mothers of the sisters, but the elder sister leaving so long ago left the two mothers without enough knowledge to really connect with her. Ophelia was independent now. Her own person. The relationship was still good, but the distance had become more than physical in the years apart. All in all, it took a half hour to get everything moved into the home. The mothers were in a rush, however, so quick hugs and kisses were given to Elissa before they ran for the truck to get started on the drive back home; Ophelia did offer to have them for dinner, but dearest mom and mom were insistent they get a move on. That they get started on their vacation seemed like something they were beyond antsy to get in motion. So it was, Ophelia waved them off, then closed the door and put one hand on her hip as she looked at Elissa. "Phew. Well. They're chatty as ever, aren't they?" asked Ophelia with a smile.


Elissa Frost
The computer and clothing was certainly the most unwieldy things to carry in, the one blessing of a shut in daughter was that most of her belongings were digital in nature. So long as her big sister didn't mind a not-insignificant up tick in traffic she would be fine. Even for clothing she travelled light, while she had enough to always be in clean clothes it was clear that any flair for fashion she may have copied from Ophelia in years past had withered. They fit, they were neat, still broadly feminine but... dull. After all why bother dressing to impress if there was nobody to impress? There was no accessories, no jewellery. Nothing. The rest of the boxes beyond the trio that had her computer and clothing were while somewhat large light as a feather, and rattled. Her other primary hobby. Needless to say if Ophelia was curious to see her sister's talent that had gotten her moving five hundred miles across the country she'd have to wait. While a part of her was proud enough to want to bring those two life-changing creations that had gotten her here she wasn't confident they'd survive the journey. Nor was she confident Ophelia wouldn't just see her effort as dorkish. She knew her sister wasn't that cold, but still that unfounded fear was what saw them left behind to keep vigil in her old room. That and maybe spite for uprooting her comfortable routine. In less than an hour her entire life had been transplanted and her parents were out the door. It was... unnerving really. She had expected both moms to fuss more. After her sister had left she had become the sole outlet for such mothering, but now they seemed almost too eager to be gone. Not that her numbness to their affection helped. But both of them knew how their Lissy was, just shy. In truth it was simply excitement, the way mom and mom were acting it wasn't out of the question both sisters would get news of a third sibling within a couple weeks... But for Elissa she couldn't help but overanalyse and run it through her own pessimistic world view. She felt like she was a burden so clearly everyone else did too, right? With them gone now though the reality of her situation was just starting to set in. The smile wasn't met with one of her own however, she was much too nervous. "Uhm... you probably want to set ground rules and stuff yeah, now that you've gotta... deal... with me."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:18pm] Ophelia hadn't opened any of the boxes, naturally. It was best to keep them all in the boxes to move them into the basement where Elissa would be living before unpacking. Plenty of room down, as Elissa would see, to store everything. Ophelia tilted her head slightly at Elissa's words. A look of mild confusion rest on her features. She responded by walking over to Elissa and very gently flicking them on the forehead. "Ground rule number one: nobody talks bad about my little sister. Especially not my little sister," she said, keeping that warm smile about her. "Seriously. I'm excited you're here. It's nice to have family here with me," she went on to say, keeping close but out of flick distance. "I know that it might not seem like it so much, since it's been so long and I haven't even managed a visit in person in all this time," she said, remorse clear in her voice. "But I missed you, Lissy."


Elissa Frost
"Ah..." The flick didn't hurt, merely took her by surprise as she reached up to touch her forehead and given that first rule. Likely the one she'd break the most often, it was the habit of a lifetime after all. The reassurance was nice though and while her smile in response was a bit forced she did look calmer for hearing that. "I'm glad..." The lilt in her voice did suggest she had intended to say more. But she was at least trying to observe that rule. Instead shaking her head a little at her sister's apology for not being around. "Mhnn. No, I understand. Mom and mom do too. You had an opportunity and you took it, like you should have." Once again she found herself looking at her feet instead of whom she was talking to. She knew it was a bad habit. "I missed you too. I've been... trying to get to this point for at least four years now. Back when we learnt you were staying here and not going back. I thought if you wouldn't come back then I could follow you instead, I mean how hard could it be right?" Well they both knew how hard at this point, she'd forced herself to become a straight A student practically overnight. "I didn't think the uni would actually accept me though... even now it barely feels real."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:20pm] Ophelia took a seat on the arm of the adjacent couch; Elissa sitting on the one parallel to the outside wall allowed them to remain close as she took this pose. She wore sympathy on her features. "Doesn't mean it wasn't still a difficult decision despite being the one I knew I had to take. It's been lonely," she said, offering a sympathetic upturn of her brow. "It only got worse when school turned into a good job here. But, I'm not surprised at all that you got accepted." She smiled. "That's my little Lissy. Always capable of a hundred billion gajillion times more than you'll ever believe, eh? But!" she slapped her thighs. "You got in! So, tonight is your night. Time to celebrate. Which meaaaannnnns you get to pick dinner tonight. And I have a small surprise for you after dinner, too." She winked and wore a smile. "And I swear if you tell me 'I don't know' or 'whatever you want is fine' to what you want I'm gonna flick you again." Still smiling, a little more playful now.

Elissa Frost
She did perk a brow when her sister sat on the arm of the couch. She had assumed they'd be more... house-proud? At least mom always was about sitting in the couch properly. Though she remembered Ophelia had been like this before she had left. It really was her. Their parents might not have recognized them as much now but... it was like not a day had passed. They'd just gotten older. "I think you're the only one who isn't. I just applied on a whim, I didn't think they'd call back. It's why everyone was in such a rush." The guilt was evident in her voice, as much as everyone wanted to celebrate she did feel bad about causing such disruption. She was used to just fading into the background. Being told tonight was her night, that there was a surprise for her she just gave a weak shake of her head. "You didn't need to go that far. You're already letting me stay." Ophelia already anticipating her responses earned slight blush. "Uh... whatever... you'd have were I not coming over?" She quickly held up her hands to signify that this wasn't actually her answer. "Uh..." Why'd they have to put her on the spot like that? She was used to just eating whatever was put in front of her. "...curry? Maybe?" Curry was easy to make, right?


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:22pm] Ophelia's face turned to one that said very loudly 'I'm going to shake you' in the most playful way while Elissa was answering. "I want you here, you dork. It's really no trouble. It's the opposite." She shook her head with a small laugh. "Seriously, you're making me feel like I'm a stranger. I'm your big sister! Jeez." Another laugh. "You don't get to worm your way out of answering this one. I'll be picking what we have plenty in our time together, to make sure you're getting good food and not just subsisting off ramen noodles and perpetuating the university student stereotype. So if you need a minute to think about it, that's cool. Though I should be clear I'm not cooking tonight. We're uh, we're gonna order in, we've got enough work getting you all situated so someone else can do the cooking. And if you are even thinking about pitching in for it I will strike you down with righteous fury. You're gonna let your big sister spoil you tonight and you are going. To. Like. It."


Elissa Frost
"I'm sorry..." Though before any shaking could happen she quickly followed it up. "I'm n-not really that good with anyone nowadays. Not even our moms really. I tend to text them if I need to say much." This was probably the most she had said in a month, Ophelia might not had felt it but this was amazingly chatty for her. "I don't mean to make things awkward it's just... kinda how I am now." Nine years was a long time after all and she'd fallen pretty far in that time. At the reassurance they were just ordering rather than cooking though she did relax a bit and choose more freely. "I can cook more than just noodles. I can do eggs too..." A moment of consideration and she gave a nod. "A-alright. I don't really have much money anyway. Uh... if we're having take-out then ...chinese? Just chow mein is fine." She was still erring on the side of caution picking something "safe" as if it actually mattered what she chose. But it was probably the closest thing her sister was going to get to a confident answer. At least at this stage. Ophelia might not have seemed any different to how she remembered her but that likely wasn't mutual. 'Lissy had always took after her sister a lot back when they both lived together, but she had always had a much greater, larger than life, presence then. Hard to imagine someone so boisterous and demanding had become the shy woman now who could barely hold a conversation. "Thank you. Sis. I have dreamed of being able to see you again."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:24pm] Ophelia smiled. "Chinese then," she echoed with a nod. "We're gonna get more than that though, Chinese is good for leftovers, so it's no big deal if we get more than we can eat, which is usually how it goes, eh?" she chuckled, then paused. She studied Elissa for a moment or two. "You're not just asleep in the car and dreaming though. Promise." She rose from the arm of the couch to wander over to the kitchen. "Where the hell did I...Oh, there it is," she muttered from the kitchen, having found her phone mid-mutter to return back to Elissa. She pulled up the website of the Mandarin restaurant for delivery and handed it to Elissa. Her phone was a very recent model with an attractive blue case with a snowy pattern on the back. A small crack in the corner of the case made it easy to assume the phone had tumbled and survived its share of drops despite being recent. But cases were made to be broken, so the phone didn't. "Better see you put more than just chow mein in," she said, winking. "Seriously. Go ham. Worst case we go into food comas and deal with unpacking tomorrow, eheh."


Elissa Frost
	"Doesn't it go all greasy and gross after?" She had tried reheating some in the microwave before, and gotten horribly sick from it. But then she was a disaster in the kitchen. "I'm kinda surprised, I figured you'd be like 'this is all poison and I won't have it in my house' ...or something." She wasn't really sure why she assumed her sister to be strict, they had never been like that years back. Being handed the phone she looked it over briefly. "It's pretty." Her own was not, a bulky Frankenstein of a phone that looked like it had been thrown in a dryer alongside a bag of gravel. It was an old hand-me-down from when she was little and rather than let it die with dignity and ask for a new one she had instead stubbornly kept it alive. Replacing the screen and battery with third party knock off versions on her own. Not that Ophelia needed to see such a monster, she knew what they'd likely do. That said she handled one a decade more modern with ease and made her order. As demanded she did put more in. Replacing her initial request with instead one portion of Singapore noodles, special fried rice and some prawn crackers. She... really did not think she'd be able to eat even half of this. Heck just two thirds of the noodles alone would probably be enough. She was a sedentary girl. But they told her to go ham and so this very conservative hamming was the result. "Okay, here." She handed the phone back. "There's not really much to unpack really. Just clothes."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:30pm] Ophelia shook her head. "Trick is to add a bit of water to noodles when reheating them in the pan," she said with a double-tap on her own nose. And actually using a pan, not that she knew Elissa was a microwave-only sort of disaster. Only one of them needed to be good at cooking, thankfully. "Oh, thanks. I like the case, but I keep dropping it so I have been meaning to get another one. Just glad the screen hasn't cracked yet." She accepted the phone back when they were done, pleased to see them having added more. "Well, I did tell mom and mum not to bother with furniture. I picked out a nice L desk and some wardrobes for you and got a new television mounted down there. Naturally that was a problem that was best solved by paying the men who move the stuff to do it for me, because if I picked up a power drill to try and mount the television god knows I'd end up with the wall looking like someone took a shotgun to it." For all Ophelia was good at, it seemed being a handyman was not one of them. Thankfully, there had proven to be a magical thing called money that worked well for getting skilled tradesmen to do things properly. Ophelia was focused on the screen for a bit before placing the order. "Of course it didn't remember my card," she muttered with an eyeroll. "Pay on delivery then, fine, place order," she continued to mutter to herself as she completed the task. "All right, that's done. Usually takes them like an hour or so. So, hope you're not too starving yet. What's say I give you the tour while we wait? Unless you'd rather just put something on the TV and chat?"


Elissa Frost
"Huh..." Well if she wasn't forewarned she'd learn soon enough just how incapable Lissy was with cooking. Clearly when it came to genetics she had taken after the mom who also couldn't cook to save their life. At the mention of a crack she hesitated in handing the phone back to instead turn it over so she could better look at the case, and the damage. She simply held it there staring in silence for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time before turning her attention back to her sister. "I could probably repair that once I've unpacked properly..." Unlike her previous could bes and probablys this one actually sounded like it was coming from a place of informed confidence. The same could not be said for the notion Ophelia had spent a small fortune on her before she had even arrived. "I'd have been happy with just a futon..." Admittedly while she knew her sister had a "good" job she had no idea what "good" actually meant, and how well off she may or may not have been. Lissy herself had never held a job in her life and while her parents had provided her with spending money she tended to avoid actually spending it out of guilt. She'd become adept at making practically nothing go way further than it should instead. "Uhm, I'm fine waiting. Mom kinda kept force feeding me snacks on the trip anyway." As for what they were supposed to do while waiting she opened her mouth to reflexively say 'whatever you want'. But she caught herself before she could do that instead giving a nod. "Wha- uh... yeah, a tour sounds good. Thanks."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:35pm] Ophelia tilted her head slightly at the offer. "Oh? Well, I do like this one, and I don't know if I'd be able to find another copy, so I'd really enjoy it if you could repair it," she said, her smile brightening with genuine pride in her little sister. Time would tell how much they would actually be able to follow up on their claims, but it was an exciting prospect. She then rolled her eyes. "Just a futon...Ugh, you wound me," she said with a giggle. "As if I'd let you sleep like that. No no, you've got a proper memory foam mattress and some fresh bamboo sheets. You'll love them," she said with an encouraging lilt. Good job apparently meant very good, or at least proved that Ophelia was smart with her money. She nodded to the notion that Elissa was fine with the wait. Then rose a brow when thanked for the tour. "...Thanks?" She sighed. "This is your house too now, you know." Maybe not legally so, but sentimentally so was clearly intended. "You don't have to be so formal about it. C'mon, let's start with the kitchen," she said, nudging with her head to move to said kitchen. As expected, the stove and counters were spotless, with some appliances - a coffee maker, a microwave, a toaster, a panini press, and a blender - currently out and taking up counter space in an organized way alongside a very pretty and ornate black knife block which sported a sleek silver trim and housed a myriad of knives (and a pair of scissors) safely and neatly. Enough room for the cutting board that was neatly slotted under one of the overhead cabinets in a plastic sheathe that was mounted to the underside, for plates, and a fair amount of other clutter before it became crowded. The electric oven looked state of the art with a fume hood sitting over top. Not a spec of grease or foodstuff. The fridge, similarly, was very nice. Ophelia went and opened each of the overhead cupboards, showing where the plates, bowls, mugs, glasses, and the rest all were. "Most of the stuff you'd be looking for will be here. Snacks and stuff are over in this cupboard. Frozen dinners for lazy days in the freezer, with some more in the deep freeze in the basement. Plenty of room for drinks in the fridge, though I try to keep a variety. Extras go downstairs on the shelves, so if there's a drink you want but there's no cold ones you can use the ice maker on the fridge door," she said, pointing to the device in question. "Just uh, if you're gonna use the cooking knives, be really careful, okay? They are uh...Extremely sharp. They were a parting gift from the chef I was apprenticing under when I moved on to working in the restaurant I'm in now, and uh, yeah. The steak knives on the bottom row are you average kind of sharp, but the ones in the top section are all something I'd not really want you using without me being there to supervise. Not because I think you're accident prone or something, but they are 'call 911 immediately' kind of sharp."


Elissa Frost
She gave a nod. "It might not look like new but it shouldn't be too hard." Time would tell indeed though given it was so far the only thing she had shown confidence in there was good promise there. "Bamboo?" Wasn't that like... made of wood or something? Clearly she had no idea and then at the gentle scolding for being so stiff she, predictably, apologized. "Sorry... uh. I mean... sorry. I'll try and remember that." Time would again tell if she'd actually allow herself to feel at home and not act like she was in a prison. The kitchen was as to be expected of someone whom cooked for a living, spacious and impressive. Far bigger than the small kitchen back home. Nice as that place was it was also an old town house and no amount of careful interior design could make up for new builds simply having twice the space to work with. All spotless, sleek and modern. She did appreciate being shown where everything was too, though rather than remembering where drinks and snacks were it was where all the plates and pots lived. This was supposed to be her home, Ophelia said as much so she was absolutely going to pitch in with the housework if not with the rent. Even if her big sister objected, well there weren't enough hours in the day to pre-empt all of her little sister's attempts to be useful. "I'll be careful, promise." Given three of her fingers on her right hand were wearing band aids and another two on her left? Lissy seemed to have a more broad idea of what careful meant. Her hobby knives were probably just as sharp, and paired with fiddly work did see her slicing her fingers pretty often. Usually not noticing until she had started bleeding on her work that she'd done it. "...I'm kinda surprised you live on your own actually. You're pretty, and smart. I figured you'd already be y'know... married or something."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:45pm] Ophelia gave a smile when Lissy promised to be careful. "If it's as careful as with whatever gave you those bandages I'll still want to keep an eye out," she said with a giggle. The notion of being married evoked a bright blush from the elder sister along with some brief wide eyes, then a look to the side. "A-Ahah, well. Uh. You're gonna start sounding like our moms if you go saying things like that," she said, awkwardly chuckling. "But, well, y'know...Just hasn't been in the cards I guess. Restaurant work is busy sometimes. It's not like I haven't dated here and there, there just wasn't any spark. Plus, well, with some guys they get all excited that you can cook and it gets into their ego that they'll have a professional chef stay-at-home wife or something and their lizard brains turn on and--" She cut herself off, shaking her head. "The right person is out there somewhere, Lissy. For both of us. There's no rush, eh?" She smiled. "What about you, huh? Have any hot dates in school, maybe a long distance boyfriend I should know about?" She smirked lightly and leaned forward, arms crossed over her abdomen, seemingly intent on flipping the script on her little sister.


Elissa Frost
She blinked a little at the notion of bandages before she looked down at her own hands. "Oh..." She then peeled one off, it had been a couple days on the road and more since she had sliced her fingers. Those wounds were healed though without the bandaid it revealed a number of thin white lines criss-crossing the same parts of her fingers. Needless to say it was likely a common occurrence. The topic of being married earning a blush did come as a surprise as she canted her head. It was pretty unusual to see her sister be shy or bashful, at least based on her limited perception of her. Ophelia had left long before that sort of topic got bandied about after all. She just guessed her sister was confident in all things at all times. Their phone calls never went beyond pleasantries and checking in either. A lot of what Ophelia blurted out went over her head. Lizard brains? Did they turn all mean and nasty or something? A troubled expression crossed her face, only worsening as the notion of there being someone for her was brought up. She expected the question to be flipped back on her. Her gaze falling to the ground as she turned her head to the side, one hand holding her arm. "I don't have anyone, not even friends. I haven't for a few years now. There's a few people I talk to besides our moms, but that's mostly just people being polite y'know?" Ophelia might have intended for her little gesture to be just playful teasing but for her sister it felt judgemental. It wasn't as if their parents had simply left Elissa's social reclusion alone, but they were as much at a loss of how to help that as she was at making friends. "Sorry... kinda lame huh?"


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:47pm] Ophelia's expression softened. She kept a smile about her and walked over to her little sister to stand beside them and pull them into a side hug. "Hey, high school is for chumps anyway," she said while looking at her little sister from the side. "You'll find a lot more people in your element in university. People are less stupid there. More mature. Generally speaking," she said with a chuckle. "But honestly? The best friends you'll make will be beyond that, too, usually. People you meet at work and stuff. I don't talk to anyone from high school, and maybe one or two people from university days. Life can be messy, and sometimes it takes you away from the people you care about," she said, the tone making it clear this was at least partially about the two of them. "The people who really matter stay in touch, and are always there to welcome you with open arms. So until you are the most popular girl in the whole school and are batting away suitors with a stick? You've got your big sis here for you, and I'm not going anywhere this time, got me?" Another smile. "I'm here for you, Lissy. For the long haul. We're gonna have a lot of fun together."


Elissa Frost
Her self pity was broken by that hug, going tense for a moment before a heavy exhale left her and she squeezed back. "My element is in my room or on the internet, I'm not sure I want people there." Though the mention of people being more mature and less stupid did have her head pulling away from her sister. "I thought you were trying to reassure me, I need people on my level." When her sister started talking about her own relationship she squeezed once more. "You realize what you're saying right? Because if you promise that I'm going to hold you to it." Still it helped her feel better, no doubt eventually they would have to part again. Her sister had her own life to live after all and there likely was not going to be room in there for a clingy sister. But for now at least she could live in the moment once more. "Thanks, sis. I think I'll be alright. Long as I have you..." A long pause followed then she spoke up once more. Albeit with a quieter volume, still legible but barely above a whisper. "...Just don't put me ahead of yourself."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:49pm] Ophelia giggled. "Goofball," was her response to Elissa's 'people on my level' comment. "I know what I'm saying," she said, then moved to stand in front of Elissa again. She took both of her little sister's hands and squeezed them. "Listen. I know it was hard," she said, closing her eyes. "I'm sorry. And if I could do it again, I'd do more to find time to visit in person. That's easy to say in retrospect of course but...What I'm saying is of all the things that I gained for what I had to do, I never wanted it to come at a cost of being separated from you. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do," she said, eyes opening again to look at Lissy. There was sorrow in those eyes. "You've got me, okay? I'm gonna make it all up to you."


Elissa Frost
She listened to them in silence, she knew it wasn't as if they wanted to leave her. Even if occasionally a voice in the back of her head suggested such. There had been Christmases, birthdays, where she was upset that all she had was a phone call. But at the same time it was always impossible to be unhappy in the moment. At least they were still there, at least she could hear their voice. At that final comment, of making it back up to her she pulled one hand away. Bringing it up to cup her sister's cheek instead as she shook her head. "Don't." She forced a smile. "You chased your dream. There's nothing there to make up for. I'd feel a hundred times worse if I felt like I had held you back from all this." She glanced around at the immaculate kitchen, the rest of the ground floor of this spacious and modern house in a nice neighbourhood. Ophelia had done better for herself than many people her age. A lot better. "You're happy where you ended up right? Then it was the right choice."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:50pm] Ophelia wore mild surprise on her face at the cupping of her cheek. She didn't resist. She eased into the touch, closing her eyes again. Relief seemed to wash over her in the wake of the understanding words given. "Wish I could have taken you along," she said quietly with a smile. There was regret on her face, some silent inference that she could have done better. "Well. It's all in the past now, right? So we'll just focus on making things great." A smile followed. "There's not much else to this floor, besides the dining room there I guess," she said, gesturing to the dining room behind Elissa. "So uh, care to continue the tour? Basement and your room is down through that door," she said, pointing to the door in the corner of the dining room. "Upstairs is the master bath and my room. Still got like a half hour before the food shows up I'd say."


Elissa Frost
She felt a sense of relief too, much as she had hurt for these last few years she did genuinely want the best for the sister even if this did come at the expense of herself. That was fine after all, she was a loser. Ophelia always held all of their parent's hopes and expectations. That's what she'd been telling herself for so long just to cope with her own feeling of indolence. With the mention of resuming the tour she then remembered where she was touching as she quickly pulled her hand back as if Ophelia's cheek was scalding hot. Holding her hand close to her chest as her cheeks almost matched her hair. "Ahh... haha... yeah, we could do that, yeah." Rubbing the back of her head she looked over at the stairs that led up before flicking her gaze back to her sister. She was curious but... "Well I probably shouldn't be rooting around in your space anyway, so uh... downstairs? I do have some stuff to unpack after all."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 7:52pm] Ophelia giggled at Elissa's actions, then nudged with her head. "All right, we'll bring some boxes down then since we're heading down." She moved over to the door in the corner of the dining room and pulled on it to open it. The door did not have a lock, and there was a rubber stopper installed on the adjacent wall to catch the door in the event it was slammed open so it wouldn't punch a hole in the wall. With the door left open, she moved over to the entrance to grab one of the heavier boxes of clothes. Not too much for her to heft, but enough that it was a one box sort of trip. She moved with Elissa in tow down the sturdy stairs to the basement. It was a bit cooler in the basement, which was nice given the oppressive heat of the current weather. In the basement, a deep freeze lined the immediate wall across from the stairs, next to the door to Elissa's room. Circling back around from the direction of the stairs would give a

view of the storage racks that had been set up. Simple wood slats with metal bars for the skeleton of the racks, upon which all manner of odds and ends had been left. From dry foods to some power tools to cleaners, this seemed to be where everything that didn't fit somewhere else was stored. Ophelia nudged with her head towards the door. She opened it with some minor difficulty while holding the box as well, revealing Elissa's room. This door did have a simple lock on the doorknob for the girl's privacy. Not something that couldn't be easily broken if needed, but enough to stop the knob from turning and let outsiders know that Elissa was not to be disturbed. The room had a bed, the promised L-shape desk in the corner, a large dresser, a nice television set up and mounted to the wall beside the door, with an entertainment center below, both out of the way of the swing of the door, a nightstand by the bed, and two wardrobe cabinets to work with. The be

d had simple white sheets and bedding, with an abundance of pillows at the headboard. It was a nice bed. Not a simple, cheap thing that one could acquire hastily. Something that one would bring with them when moving. Solid hardwood on the head and footboards along with the frame. The mattress, if sat or laid on, proved to be a luxurious memory foam that was still firm enough to provide ample support and avoid any weird sleep pains. Ophelia set the box down on the hardwood flooring. "Phew. Well, this is it. This is yours. The furniture doesn't quite match, wasn't a whole set for what I wanted to get in here, but it's all white, and has the sort of finish that would let us paint them sometime if you wanted, which I figured would be good enough. Uh. But also this was just kinda the basics, n' stuff. I wanted you to have room for whatever you were bringing, but it's definitely got room to be more fully furnished if you can think of other stuff you want."


Elissa Frost
She did want to be the one to shoulder the heavier of the boxes, even if most of them were not really all that heavy. Even without packing light Lissy simply had not an awful lot of things. She was pretty unplugged from reality. She made up for it by grabbing a triple stack of boxes that, while light did almost cover her face even with holding them below her waistline. Admittedly a somewhat precarious journey given they were going down stairs as well but she managed without tripping and falling. "Guess I'm a basement dweller now huh?" Hopefully her sister took it as the ribbing at herself it was meant to be and not a complaint about her accommodation. She was serious when she said she'd have been fine with a futon in the garage. Apparently not all of the basement was hers however, prior to this being converted to a room it was clearly a sort of dumping ground. "Huh, it's a room in

side of the basement then?" There was a little bit of surprise in her voice. "Mhn that works actually. I can probably do airbrushing and stuff out here rather than worry about the floor in my room." Opening it up? Well it was nothing short of an upgrade, even if Ophelia considered it spartan. Her room back home had been rather pokey, she had been given the option several times to move into Ophelia's old room in her place and get some more space. But she somewhat enjoyed the cramped feeling, not to mention that with her sister's old room left always in a state where she could move right back in the next day she did enjoy going in there just to sit and pretend her sibling was simply away on an errand and not half a country away. No such coping was needed now, so maybe she could stretch her wings a little? Or at least build this small army of plastic she had been amassing without a place

to put them. One of the boxes she was holding was from Christmas. That desk already proving it's worth as she dumped her own boxes on that instead of her usual delivery spot of either on the bed or on the floor; the biggest of shelves. "This feels way more than just the basics. Just the basics would be a bed and maybe a shelf. Not..." She gestured around wildly. "...all of this!" She let her arms flop down again as she paced around the room tentatively, her room. This felt way too welcoming, far nicer than she deserved for forcing herself back into her sister's life. Eventually sitting down on the bed and loosing a slight sound of surprise at the softness. Her old mattress had been starting to get pretty hard and uncomfortable, though she had kept silent about it to not be a bother. "Thank you, Sis. This is... way too much. But thank you. Really. I'll make this up to you, somehow."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:00pm] Ophelia met their response with a chuckle. "I thought we weren't about making anything up to each other?" she asked with a playful tilt of her head, arms folded over her chest. "This room used to be kinda just an extra room. I think it was supposed to be like an office space?" She shrugged. "It's really nothing. Mom and mum helped out with the funds for this." Helped out, not took care of, notably. "I don't really think it's too much. And I did say there was more to come didn't I? Like, if you need anything. Whatever you're going to school for is probably gonna need us to move this all around and get you a working space if it's more than just needing your desk and computer stuff." She paused, tapping at her lower lip. "What was that again? Mom and mum were so over the top yelling about how much needed to get done they never answered me on what program you got accepted to."


Elissa Frost
"I know but still. I feel like I need to. Just let me help in my own way yeah?" As for extras this place needed she scratched her cheek. "I'm not really sure what more I could need... I'm not just saying that either. I literally can't think of anything. I uh... have no idea what I'm even doing." At the mention of Ophelia not even knowing what course she was on Lissy just blinked a little in surprise. "Geez. Y'know they were like, all over each other on the way here too. I thought Miya was gonna cause an accident the way she kept squeezing Yvette's thigh..." She tailed off with a shake of her head and more pink cheeks. "...I've never felt so awkward in a hotel room before." Of course she was happy that her parents were still in love. But that didn't mean she couldn't feel embarrassed with them gushing over each other. Oh, right her course. She glanced to the side for a moment briefly considering if she could also evade answering that question, because she knew right where this was going. She'd tell them and then they'd want to see the work that got her accepted. Gawd, where was that takeout delivery to save her from this? "Uhh... m-media. Media and film production. Mostly, like, special effects and stuff." It was mumbled more to the floor than to her sister. "I recorded something with my gunpla and sent it to the uni. I didn't think they'd call back and invite me to enrol on their course..."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:02pm] Ophelia gave her little sister a look. The sort of look that was chiding them in the most gentle way. "I'm gonna beat you up if you keep on with double standards," she said with a giggle and a little smirk, then shook her head. "Oh I believe it. They've always been dramatic. Can't take them anywhere. Not without getting super embarrassed by all the gushing." She smiled. "But it's only gross 'cause they're our moms, y'know? That sorta romance would be sooooo cute anywhere else. I've gotten less embarrassed about it with time, but, well, that might just be from not being exposed to it for so long. Being in a hotel room with them though? Eeessh. Yeah. I don't envy that," she said with a more full laugh. The talk about the course had her perking up. "Oh? Special effects? Gonna be blowing up cars in hollywood, eh?" Another smile. "That's really cool though. We'll have to get you set up with all the fancy camera equipment when we can. I have a DSLR and a few lenses that I used for some promo material and helping with the menu at the place I'm working. My work subsidized that one so it didn't bite the wallet quite as hard. But yeah! I got a tripod, uh, somewhere for it, too. All yours if you need it." She smiled. "What's a gunpla?"


Elissa Frost
The playful threat did quiet her down with a small sorry tacked on the end for good measure. Still, talking about their parents like this was pleasantly nostalgic. It was a frequent topic of their short phone calls. Ophelia would always ask her how she was, she'd lie and say everything was fine, then they'd ask about their moms and they'd chat for a bit. Then right as she got the courage up to maybe open up a little the call would have to end. Already Ophelia had probably learnt more in the last half hour than the last nine years. Shame most of it wasn't good. "I know right? Always have to come back after to apologize for them." Well in truth she hadn't gone out anywhere with them in a long time, every offer was politely rebuffed until eventually the offers stopped being made in perhaps a misguided attempt to be understanding. As for blowing up cars she shook her head. "More, trying to recreate it without blowing up the car in the first place I think. Green screens and stuff like that y'know?" The mention of a high quality camera did take her interest as she perked a brow. "That'd help a lot. Uhm, I recorded my portfolio with Miya's old camcorder." Not a terrible relic but it was clearly meant for recording family videos of kids playing in the yard, not high detail work. Then came a question which she did not expect but should have still feared. What her hobby even was. Her face going a little pale as she glanced away and chewed her lip. "It's uhm... it's... a thing. Uhm..." She loosed a sigh. "Like, model robots you build..."Could this bed maybe open up straight to hell? She was all ready to curl up in the fetal position. "I don't have any built with me before you ask."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:04pm] Ophelia smiled and chuckled along with the nostalgic conversation. It was clear she was happy to have Elissa with her, even if Elissa was feeling nervous and having trouble adjusting. This moment of connection had Ophelia's face brightening significantly. She nodded to the notion that the camera would be helpful. "You'll just have to go and wipe the card of its contents I think. Lots of pictures of food and probably a few birds in there. I am not a photographer," she admitted with a nervous chuckle to follow. The explanation about model robots had her smiling. "Oh, that's cool! I had a friend who was super into minis for something called Warhammer or something. He got really into it. I lacked both the time and brain power to begin to comprehend the eight thousand rulebooks for it but the minis were cool to look at. Sounds like what you have is more intricate though, something you have to actually put together?" She smiled. "Can't wait to come down here and see the whole robot battalion standing guard.~"


Elissa Frost
In spite of her imposter syndrome she was enjoying it too, this was the most animated she had been in years. Sometimes she could go days without even talking, to the point she'd actually lose her ability to voice anything at all. Being indoors all the time also likely didn't help, her health was a bit of a mess. "I can back it up first." As for the money sink that was warhammer she nodded. "Yeah... it's kinda complex. Especially nowadays, everything has it's own special niche rules. It doesn't feel like you're actually being strategic, just finding the most broken combination of things to automatically win. Plus... well I only played a bit in school and when those guys moved away I couldn't find anyone else to play with. Not without going to a big meetup or something and well..." She shook her head. "Plus it's really expensive... though I guess my gunpla is too. It's why I started kitbashing, uh - making models out of spare parts and scrap plastic rather than a kit. Sometimes I'd find people online who'd send their models or minis to me and I'd paint them for money. That helped pay for things so I didn't have to keep asking our moms for handouts." Ophelia's positivity was infectious, it was hard to be dismissive of herself when her sister sounded so genuine. Not to mention she was still a little scared that if she wasn't fun enough she might get booted out. An insane notion but one she still felt. "Uhm... it's not the same. But I do have the recording I sent to the university still... If you want to see it."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:06pm] Ophelia shook her head. "Ah it's okay. I already have it backed up. I might not be a great photographer but I am pretty decent with computers," she said with a smile. "Enough that I can photoshop things after to make something passably presentable at least. And troubleshooting the odd PC game has taught me a thing or ten. Enough to know that backing things up is very important. All it takes is one slip and the camera is in the drink," she said with a bit of nervousness. Past experience, or dreaded scenario? "Oh, you like it too? Hm, hm.~ One expensive hobby at a time, eh?" She appreciated the explanation for these alien terms. Following along at least conceptually. "Oh, you do have it? Well. Now you HAVE to show me."


Elissa Frost
"Mhm, you've always been smart so that checks out." Needless to say anything of her sister's she'd treat as if it was made of solid gold. Though at the mention of hobbies she shook her head a little. "Former hobby, even if I still had an army and someone to play with the current rules just aren't fun for me. Too much creep to get you to buy new stuff." Predictably her sister wanted to see and well, she could hardly deny them after offering to show it. She was almost proud about it now, she wasn't sure why but she had assumed she'd get teased or lambasted for not having a "girly" hobby. "I guess I have too yeah." Opening up one of the boxes that was holding her loose computer peripherals he found the USB drive she was looking for, a quick inspection of the side of the TV revealing a port for it, it did look pretty new and pretty huge. "I wonder how blocky it'll look stretched out on this." Playing the file it opened up to a scene of a seemingly massive looking mecha standing ready in it's flight bay. A huge mass of details and plastic, while it did have some notes of what a gundam looked like the thing looked much more scaled down in excess wings and additions. A more westernized military look. Calling it less detailed however was not accurate, the thing had only been on the screen for a few seconds yet already it was telling a story without words. There was battle damage and signs of wear and tear all over. The machine's formerly vibrant paint faded and scorched from hasty repairs and jury riggings. Most of all it didn't look like ten inches of plastic, it looked enormous. A huge steel warrior stubbornly clinging on even as it was riddled with wounds. Part of this was the tiny people running around and the surrounding scenery. There was the occasional slip where the illusion was revealed, the green screen that the mech had been shot in front of letting the set dressing bleed over a little. That or just the fact that the CGI was not nearly as detailed as the gunpla itself. The story, and voice over, was pretty generic. Lissy had more or less copied a debriefing cutscene verbatim and only changed it just enough to make sense for the current plot while trying to sound like a cool professional military woman... and not too convincingly. Yet it still looked good, playing out on the highly detailed cockpit she had fashioned. After a briefing the machine was launched, in a movement that looked incredibly smooth for just stop motion. Not perfect, and wires could be seen as slight camera artefacts. There it came face to face with it's opponent. Another mighty war machine. While she had built both the look and feel of each seemed totally alien. As if an entirely different nation of history had gone into it's design. It too told a story far longer than the four minute run time of the video just in the detailing, and Lissy's perhaps self indulgent camera work to show it all off. Again, she had to voice this rival too. A very bad impression of a grizzled man's voice that was masked with some static effect... but still clearly a young woman putting on an impression. Then came the fight itself. Three minutes of robots fighting on a desk, yet with a little computer effort it was instead a ballet of death in space. The sound effects were just stock from youtube, there was no music. Yet the motions were so smooth, these things LOOKED real. Every action seemed to carry immense weight yet still be floaty at the same time. Anticipation, build-up, motion, and relaxation. Every action made sense and looked fitting, clever camera angles gave the illusion of blows traded without any actual damage having to be seen. At least until the final flourish and her trump card. With a mighty swing the first mech punched through the second, tearing into it's torso. Using it's massive strength, and excessive gunfire to melt and rip it's opponent in twain. This did show damage, and grievous amounts of it. The model twisting on the screen to reveal just as detailed innards as steel was shorn and melted, wires and hydraulics pouring out like organs. The sundered machine being kicked into the darkness of space and rather than a crummy stock image of an explosion instead the camera was focused in the victor as it shone in the light of it's enemy's demise before all faded to black. "Ehe... I wasn't intending to have the second one blow up like that... but I kinda dropped it during filming and it got broken anyway. So I rolled with it."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:12pm] Ophelia smiled. "You've always been smart, too, Lissy," she said back, then watched as they got things set up on the television. She nabbed the remote to help out, turning it on and opening up the smart television's media player to read the file on the USB. Fortunate that Ophelia did ensure Lissy had a recent model TV and not some bargain thing that would make a simple act as this a nightmare. Once it started, Ophelia leaned against the footboard, arms folded, to watch. Her expression was easy enough to read. A broad smile and proud eyes. The production quality was about as barebones as could be, but Ophelia watched it with more enthusiasm than she would ever watch a Hollywood blockbuster. When it concluded, she smiled wider and clapped. "Wow, that was awesome!" she exclaimed with a bright giggle. "You made that with like what, a zero dollar budget?" she asked, pride flowing through her words. "That must have taken you forever. I can see why you got accepted. Sure it has some mistakes and the effects were simple, but like, that's why you go to school, to learn how to do it better, right? But you've clearly got a passion for this, don't you?" she smiled at Elissa. "Rolling with the punches is something I imagine you have to do a lot of. Mistakes happen all the time in movies. Some of the unscripted stuff is the best, in terms of both the dialogue but also the stunts and CGI stuff too."


Elissa Frost
She still felt embarrassed about people she knew and cared about actually seeing this. In fact only Ophelia had now, she had managed to hide her efforts from their parents. Though she imagined that wouldn't last for much longer now that the cat was out of the bag. It did feel good though to be praised like that, even if she felt like it was a little too positive. "Well like... twenty dollars budget. The two gunpla were broken kits that I rescued from the trash for five bucks each. Plus a bunch of other waste plastic, broken toys from thrift shops and obviously the glue, paint and resin. That's where most of the cost comes from. They uh... really don't look as good unpainted. It took me about three days all together to actually film it start to finish, making the robots about a month each but I was more lax with that." She nodded along with the criticism as it was given, it was all stuff she agreed with. "I think so, or like... camera techniques or something? I just kinda looked on youtube how to do a green screen effect for free and then used some coloured card for the backdrop." She shook her head a bit with an amused exhale. "It uh... was a lot of work." Still passion, was this passion? Sure she liked making gunpla and kitbashing, and she didn't really hate making the movie either even if it was hard work. But she wasn't sure if she was passionate about it, shouldn't she have felt stronger than that? "I dunno... it just kinda seemed like a good idea at the time and three days later I was mailing off a USB and finally going to bed. Then I got a letter back that I'm one of the fifty out of six hundred entries to be chosen." She didn't look nor sound like she was feigning humility, rather speaking from a place of genuine confusion. "...I really don't know how I ended up here. It doesn't feel real."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:14pm] Ophelia kept her smile about her. There was something more to her expression that seemed suspect in a positive way, but whatever it was stayed inside her head. "You ended up here because you worked hard. Something had to be driving you along to get it done, right?" She removed the USB while talking to hand back to Elissa. "The important part is whether or not you had fun. So. Did you have fun? Is it something you want to do more of? Obviously with what you're doing in the program coming up you're going to need to be doing similar things, though whether or not you can star your gunplas in them all is another matter." Another smile. "Whatever it is, I wanna support you through it all. I'm sure there are a lot of things I could justify to mom and mum as being absolutely necessary for school. You think they'd buy it if I told them it was required for school that they send us money for take out?" A cheeky smile followed.


Elissa Frost
Her sister's expression was difficult to read, she didn't always remember it as such. Back then it felt as if the pair of them could communicate wordlessly, though whether that was true or rose tinted memories she couldn't be sure. She knew there was a little more there than just a happy smile though. As for what drove her she gave a nod. "Mhm... because I missed you. I just wanted to see you in person again. I... kinda went overboard a little huh?" She took the stick back, laying it on the table alongside the rest of the stuff she'd need to eventually unpack and sort. As for having fun she canted her head a bit. "I don't... hate the idea of doing more of this I guess?" She never really did things because they were fun but because they were effective distractions, just games or browsing the net didn't work. Her thoughts would always seep back in and reclaim her attention. "I don't really know if it's fun but like... when I'm building. Or when I made that movie time just seems to move faster. I didn't realize I'd spent three days straight on it until after I was done and felt dizzy with a really bad headache." Was that fun? Even the letter the school sent used the word passion when praising her work. She felt like an alien, understanding the emotions said but not how they felt. "I appreciate the offer, but don't drag yourself down either yeah? I'm sure I can manage." Or not and she'll go home as a failure... The comment about taking their dinner as a teaching expense did get a frown though. "Don't abuse our parent's good will either. I'll make do with what I have myself."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:16pm] Ophelia giggled into the back of her palm, then waved her hand at Elissa dismissively. "I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I would never. I dislike asking them for money as much as you I'm sure. I couldn't refuse their offer to balance out the budget a little with the house payments, that just makes sense, and I feel it's a fair arrangement. But otherwise I don't expect to be hounding them. God knows I don't wanna ring them up and hear one of them pick up the phone all out of breath," she said with an awkward laugh, then cleared her throat and swiftly moved on from the topic. "...You didn't have to go all out to get into the same school I went to just to see me. Honestly, if you just said you wanted to move in here after high school it probably would have worked out just the same. Don't get me wrong though, I'm happy you got it. You deserve it. I think you'll find out really quickly that what you see as nothing special is going to be very much above the standards of your peers. Not to say there won't be gifted people you meet in school - the standards of the university are still high. But there's still gonna be people who got in on nepotism who are totally clueless. A lot more than you'd imagine," she said with an eyeroll that spoke of experience. "As for fun? You describe fun pretty well with all that. I know that there have been some times I've been preparing a bunch of food and thinking about allllll the things I could make with the ingredients and just keep grabbing peppers and onions and the like while I have the energy and suddenly I have six containers of prepped veggies and an hour and half has disappeared while I was lost in my imagination." She shrugged. "Sounds like passion to me."


Elissa Frost
"Ahh... yeah..." Rather than share her awkward laugh the pinkness of her hair just extended down to her cheeks now. "It's kinda weird... two girls feels more normal than a girl and a guy. Even though it's kinda... not." As for going all out just being told she could have simply asked to move here felt almost like the rug being pulled out from under her. All that effort, soul searching, stress and trepidation... it was practically meaningless! She had an incredulous look on her face as she was made aware of this. God why did she do this to herself? "Ahh... uh... I..." A huff left her as she desperately searched for a way to reconcile this to herself. The fact she had potentially changed her life for the better by taking the hard way didn't even seem to go registered. After all she hadn't done this to better herself she'd done it to see her sister again. Everything else was a by-product of that. "...w-well you wouldn't want me just mooching here for no reason right? I should still have a good reason for inconveniencing everyone." This wasn't self depreciation this time, this was trying to not feel like a giant idiot in her own strange logic. Her expression reflected that. As for the nepotism she gave an idle nod. "I guess... but like, if you can get in that way I think they'd want to go to like a directing or producer's course right? I don't think anyone's ever gotten famous being the special effects girl." At least she hopes not. "...though I guess I'll probably have to do what they say in school. Great..." They're gonna bully her, she just knows it. "I was kinda surprised actually that you like cooking so much. I mean. I know you liked it back when we were little kids, but I figured you just liked helping mom like I did." She rubbed at the back of her head. "Guess I didn't really understand you too well. I mean... I was like nine at the time. Still..."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:18pm] Ophelia rose a brow at Elissa saying two girls feels more normal. But, she moved on from that without a word, though she certainly was anything but bothered by this implication, going by her expression. "Like I said, I'm proud of you for what you did. You wouldn't be allowed to mooch, no," she said with a giggle. "You'd need a job in that hypothetical. But there's a big entertainment presence here, so with the degree you're getting you'll have a way easier time getting a job in that field versus just being a high school grad. You'll also be spared the nightmare of fast food or retail. I did both part time during school. Ugh," she said with a shudder. "The only time I ever considered prostrating myself before our parents." Another giggle. "Make no mistake, if you can make some great effects and productions, you'll be one of those super well paid people that nobody outside the industry has ever heard of. Just like aside from celebrity chefs I hope to one day be one of those names that my peers associate with greatness in the kitchen. Maybe even have my own Michelin star places someday," she said with a smile. "Grand dreams. But still a long way off. It started as just wanting to help out but...You do something, you feel good about it, you feel like you can do it well, it just...Clicks. And then it just snowballs and suddenly it's your career. Not to say that's guaranteed what is going on for you but, if it is? Then I am so glad to be supporting you through that next step towards it." A warm smile followed. "Whatever it is, I'll just say again that I'm happy to have you here. I'd take any excuse to have my little sister here with me again."


Elissa Frost
The brow did pause her to pause briefly. She did say it was weird herself but even her sister found it odd? She gave a nod at the mention of a job. "I kinda wanna get one anyway... well I don't. People suck and are scary but... I wanna be useful. Even if you say I don't need to do that." Of course how she'd feel about being a bread winner when she's neck deep in studies was another matter. Her sister mentioning the two worst professions did have her shake her head and loose a sigh. "I'm sorry..." She liked to think that she was okay as a customer. She only ever visited thrift shops in person and struggled to string a sentence together but the older volunteers who worked there always seemed happy to see her. No, it was her former friends that awoke to her just how awful people could be to service staff. "Hopefully you didn't have too many Paulas." Ophelia might not have remembered Lissy's friends, they didn't often intermix outside of when her sister came to pick her up from school. Even back then Paula was loud and entitled. Her friends, Lissy included, treated more like servants and with the tone she used it was clear that trait had only worsened with age. She'd become the Karen-Prime. Blight of malls everywhere. "I don't really know what I'd do with a ton of money... will you help me spend it when the time comes, you me and our moms?" Another rare smile on her lips at the offer, and one that remained when her sister spoke of her own dream. "I'd like to treat others to your cooking too, I'll promise to bring all my, uh, film crew? Bring them with me to your place. So everyone can be jealous at what I enjoy back home." Bit by bit she was feeling more optimistic, her path still felt entirely out of her control. Like unseen forces were dragging her by the scruff of the neck. But if this was the destination? Well she was okay with that. "No... I think that kinda is. Maybe a little ahead of where I actually am. I'm not sure this wasn't all just a fluke but... I'd like it to be true." As for being back with her sister, that comment did get her a touch misty eyed as she nodded. "Thanks, Ophelia. It means a lot to know you feel the same."


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:20pm] Ophelia shook her head. "You really don't," she countered, looking at her sister sympathetically. "I know you wanna be useful, but I'd rather you put that energy into just helping around the house when you're not focused on your schoolwork. Besides, those part time jobs pay nothing. Not that a couple extra hundred couldn't find a purpose, but really. It's more energy than it's worth in this case. If you wanna give back with money, then how's about this: once you are done school and have an awesome job, you can treat me to dinner at a super fancy restaurant?" Ophelia giggled. "You know, the sort that can live up to my standards." A big-sisterly smile played upon her lips. The sort that made clear she was understanding Elissa's desires by giving them a promise, but truly cared more about supporting them right now instead of worrying about Elissa pulling their weight money-wise. Chores were still a thing they could do that were presented as far more of a reasonable middle ground. "Ugh, please tell me you're not friends with Paula anymore," she said with an eyeroll. "I'll show you all the nice ways to spend money, don't worry. And for the time being you can learn it without complaining about whose money it is." Wink. "Advance warning if you bring more people. I cook to exact portions." She then smiled and stepped forward to hug Elissa. "And of course, Lissy. I love you, you know? I feel terrible in hindsight for how long it's been since I could hug you. So let me be the best big sister in the world for you. Please?~"


Elissa Frost
She did expect that response, and well, she may have rationalized it away as simply listening to her sister's experience in such affairs she didn't really want to be working her evenings and weekends away in a fast food joint. That time was better spent on Ophelia. So she dropped the issue of paying remarkably easily. "Mhm... alright." Though she still tried to make it sound like she was reluctant. "Not like you are struggling with how nice your place is I guess." As for Paula she shook her head a little. "I... don't really have friends any more. I think some of them are still together but I kinda drifted away and I don't think they really noticed me leaving, heh." Her sister's wink was met with a flat little stare through half lidded eyes at the prospect of becoming comfortable spending someone else's money. "Don't ask the impossible." She drew close to Ophelia and when they said they felt terrible she did reach out to lay her hand on theirs as she gave a little squeeze. Her head soon coming to rest on their shoulder. "Hey, I don't blame you for that so don't blame you either. Isn't that what you'd say to me?" She lifted her head from that shoulder to give them a smile before going back in to cuddle against them. "I love you too. 'n you're already the best, you never stopped. Even when you were far away."
	

Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:22pm] Ophelia closed her eyes and gently stroked Elissa's back. "I'll always be your best friend," she said quietly. "Paula wasn't really a loss. You deserve better," she added, still tender in her words, then exhaled through her nose. "I guess you're right. That is what I'd say. But you can't feel my warm hugs from all those provinces away. So I ask for forgiveness for how sappy I'm gonna be in these first few weeks you're here with me," she said with a giggle. "I took some time off to make sure you could settle in." She then stepped back, keeping her hands on Elissa's arms. She kept a smile on her lips. "And because I want to take you out shopping with me. Shopping for both of us, of course. Because picking out new outfits is so much more fun when I've got my little sis there to play dress up with me.~ But! let's go along with the rest of the tour, because if nothing stops me I'm just gonna keep hugging you and probably start crying at some point like a sappy doofus."


Elissa Frost
She just melted at the tender touches she hadn't been embraced like this in nearly a decade yet it felt so familiar as if this was something she enjoyed just yesterday. "You're more than my best friend, you're my big sis. Hehe. I could get used to this kind of sappiness to actually..." Though eventually she did pull back once Ophelia did. "Shopping?" Normally she'd pull a face, woman she may be shopping wasn't really something she enjoyed that much. She wasn't a people and crowds person, and always being so frugal she never really associated spending with pleasure, only guilt. Shopping for her was finding what she needed online getting it over and done with as quickly as possible. Plus it was clothes shopping... because of course it was. But it had been years, at this point even going to the dentist together sounded fun. Well, maybe not that far. "You know my fashion sense is like... non existent right?" She gestured to herself A skirt and a simple, unflattering top. Still feminine and she looked neat, just boring. "...so long as you don't make me wear anything too weird ...or showy." No doubt they'd talk her into it anyway, she did like emulating her big sis where possible. "Hey I cried on the doorstep didn't I?" She gave a sight smile looking away before following it up with a nod. "I mean if you're sure, but up there's all your space right?"


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:28pm] Ophelia chuckled. "We'll fix that," she said to the notion of fashion sense and ruffled Elissa's hair. "Some cute tops are a little showy. And besides, you're gorgeous, hon. Not to put any pressure, because you should dress how you feel most comfortable, but if nothing else you should have a few showy outfits to wear at least for those days you are feeling confident. Trust me when I tell you, wearing something that makes you feel pretty does wonders for keeping you smiling. Doubly so if you get compliments on it." Wink. "And yeah, it's my room and stuff, but what, you think I'm gonna pass on the chance to show off my room?" Another chuckle. "Plus, the bathroom down here is fine, but if ever you really wanna relax, there's a super big tub in the upstairs bath, and I would be offended if you didn't get to enjoy that tonight. Plenty of bath bombs to pick from, too. Nothing beats a home spa day and crawling into fresh sheets after a long day." She then nudged with her head. She moved with Lissy to the downstairs bathroom, showing them the space with a vague 'tada' gesture. It was a functional, boring bathroom. But it was part of the tour. So she had to include it. The washer and dryer were pointed out as well before circling back up the stairs. Then around to the front of the house to the staircase that led upstairs. At the top of those stairs was a set of three doors. One on the right that was locked. One directly down the hall. One more on the left, adjacent wall to the stairs. She moved to the left hand door, revealing the much, much more impressive master bathroom, complete with walk in shower, massive tub that could easily fit four people in it at least, heated floors, heated towel racks, and luxurious sinks with a large mirror that spanned the length of the beautiful counter that housed the two sinks. Clearly, this was a bathroom that was built with a rich married couple in mind. "See? I mean I doubt you're gonna wanna climb two flights of stairs for the morning shower, and we gotta make sure the times we wanna use it don't overlap. But I have lived her long enough that anything less than this just doesn't cut it for me these days."


Elissa Frost
"Mnngh... fffine. Maybe I'll wear something showy, for you." It'd take a while before she wasn't too self conscious to dress that way outside the comfort of home. She didn't do crowds as is, let alone dressed in a way that might invite eyes on her. She rolled her shoulders in a slight shrug giving some grunt that sounded a little like 'I dunno'. "I wasn't sure if you wanted some space to yourself, I'm happy having you here but I guess just trying to be respectful?" In truth she had no idea where she was even going with this, being shown around wasn't like she was about to be sharing the same bed. But at least it revealed she was considering this room as her own now. The basement bathroom was perfectly functional and truly that was all she needed. Glancing around and giving a thumbs up gesture so her sister could get to what they clearly wanted to show off. "I mean a shower's fine for me. I don't really do the whole relax in a tub thing... I kinda get bored." Their ascent up the stairs done she was met with that frankly opulent looking bathroom. "Sis... that's a swimming pool." Seriously, the last time she saw a tub that big it was on some reality tv show that had supermodels in bikinis, champagne and a whole lot more questionable things going on. She glanced to Ophelia, briefly imagining them doing the same. Sans the illegal bits. But she could imagine them wine glass in hand soaking here like a rockstar. "How much did this even cost? Was it here before you moved in? It was right?" She might have to reconsider her sister's responsibility with money otherwise. "Huh, oh, yeah. Guess we are a bit old to share a bath, even if this thing is stupid big." She sounded a bit disappointed, soaking and just chatting sounded nice. It'd stop her getting bored anyway. "So uh, is your room as fancy as the bath, or do you just spend every evening stewing in here until bedtime?"


Sisterly Bliss
[June 20th, 8:35pm] Ophelia shrugged. "Bathing suits exist. It has a jacuzzi mode. If you wanna, we could relax together and chat sometime. And yeah, of course it was there when I moved in," she said with a giggle. "Like I am hooked on it now, but I was definitely of the same mindset as you initially. Just a shower was fine. But, ahh, you'll just have to experience it I think. It's not quuuiiite big enough to swim in, but it sure takes a heck of a long time to fill. Thankfully, it has a thing," she said, vaguely gesturing at the corner of the tub that looked like it had a touchscreen. "Sensors or something, I don't know. I just know you press the fill button and set the temp and it can rotate the knobs automatically and stops when it's full. Saves me from starting a bath and then forgetting it to come back up to a flooded bathroom, though it's another one of those things I would have found way too expensive and unnecessary if I was choosing to buy something like this. Which I wouldn't have, because it's just...Too much. But, mom and mum in their infinite wisdom picked this place and made sure to joke all about how much they were going to use it. And then have yet to spend more than ten minutes in this house," she said with a chuckle. "My room is comfy. I'll show you," she said, closing the door and moving to her room, which was the door at the end of the hall. Her room had a pretty queen size bed with a plush comforter neatly made up, with a mound of pillows not unlike Lissy's. Light blue bedding with white accents. A powerful, sleek computer with two monitors on a similarly stylish white desk with a large desk mat that depicted a pretty blue bird in flight, with wispy white and blue lines. Mechanical light up keyboard with a similar light blue backlight and pastel blue mouse. It was all very...Cute, though still modern in its design. A television, and matching furniture to hold clothes rounded out the room. Nothing out of expectation. But Ophelia did lead them along to the walk in closet, proudly throwing it open to reveal a long row of dresses hanging on silk-coated hangars, a wide selection of heels, and some neatly packed accessories like scarves and long gloves mixed in. The dresses were tasteful, but certainly there were more than a few showy options. Whether it be a low cut that would show off shoulder and cleavage plenty or a slid on the leg (or both), Ophelia certainly had her share of...Mature clothing. The sort that would be either for a formal event, or a date. "You're about the same body type as me, so I mean. The ankle length ones might drag on the floor, but some of the shorter ones might fit you nicely. You think we're the same shoe size?" She asked, looking down at their feet. Was it possible for heels to be loud? Because Elissa's ominous future of ankle pains was looming.


Elissa Frost
"Ah, yeah... that checks out." Like her sister both of her moms had done well for themselves. They weren't the one percent by any stretch but a lifetime of quiet success and working together left them in a state where an indulgence like this fancy tub, or a round the world second honeymoon, were comfortable splurges. All the modcons being listed out didn't really surprise. With how big and expensive this was she half expected the thing to mix cocktails for you as well. No, her attention was taken up by uttering the words that would seal her immediate fate now she knew her sister's desires... "I uh, don't have any swimwear though, I'll have to get some first." Of course she knew that Ophelia would probably insist on "helping" there and have her try on half the store... but well, it had been nine years. She figured she could let them have this. Okay, and yes because going on her own would be daunting. Moving swiftly on, her sister's bedroom was... impressive. Spacious and cute, she could certainly understand a little better why Ophelia considered her new room barren in comparison even if she herself didn't share the sentiment. Would her space end up looking like this? Well... probably not. It was very cute but maybe a little too much for her personally. Everything being on theme felt just a little bit twee. It was very Ophelia though, even if she had no idea this was their house she'd have felt this was their room. It just screamed that. "Wow..." Though that sound of awe did not come from the fine furnishings, cute décor or stocked wardrobe. It was from that computer. Compared to the one she had brought from home, an old prebuilt? Well it was night and day. Certainly it was glowing enough for that. "Ehe... I was gonna be fine not ever intruding but, uh, I may wanna borrow that sometime." It would be novel to play games that weren't older than she was for a change. However it seemed that her sister had an ulterior motive beyond just showing off as she was led over to their wardrobe. So many dresses and outfits. No way she had worn all of these yet. Just look how many there were! A fair portion were of course modest and mundane but... well having all the more showy options clumped together like that did make them stand out a whole lot more. This was a side of Ophelia she hadn't remembered, because likely it didn't even exist back then. Looking at these... mature outfits, then back to her sister before mumbling. "How do you not have..?" She shook her head. She practically flinched however when hey pointed out the pair of them had loosely the same proportions. Indeed, they did. She was a bit shorter but their... measurements, were pretty close. Shoe size too. "Oh no. No... no nooo." She held up her arms in an X before her. "Have mercy."
