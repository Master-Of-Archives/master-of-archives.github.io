<p>Hello, traveller. If you've stumbled across this archive, you likely are familiar with one of the realms of the typist's creation. Or perhaps you're curious. In either case, in this portal you'll find expanded setting information, pieces of lore, template codes for RPC profiles, and tidbits of insanity. You know, fun things.</p>
