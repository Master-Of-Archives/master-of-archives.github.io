<h2>
  The Shining Star Order
  </h2>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MBiCswc.jpg" style="float: right; width: 30%; height: auto; margin-left: 3vw; margin-bottom: 2vh;">
  <p>The Shining Star Order, often just the Shining Star, or SSO, is a force for peace, for good, and for lawfulness within Aetheria. Established and headquartered - a place known as the Resplendent Halls - in the Lightsworn capital of Deningrad, its members are known for their white armour which bears the symbol of the Shining Star (Pictured: right). The Shining Star began initially as a band of holy warriors fighting in the name of Crystellia, once known as 'Crystellia's Shining Stars'. Over time this collective grew, and the loyal supporters of Crystellia's will became numerous enough that a hierarchy needed to be established. Thus, the order was removed from Crystellia's namesake and granted independence, though they do still answer to her as all Lightsworn people do. Now, at the top of the Shining Star sit two leaders: Battlemaster Odric, a human man with an unmatched wit on the battlefield, and Knight-Commander Aurora, a human woman whose battle prowess and inspiring leadership has made her the face of the Shining Star, and a celebrity among most all Lightsworn people.</p>
  
  <p>In the current day, admission to the Shining Star Order has expanded to any Aetherian-born person who wishes to oversee law. Though it remains open to other nations, however, there is yet to be any who have joined from another nation. Most adventurers who aim to do good tend to do so of their own accord, not wishing to willingly impose the bureaucracy of the SSO onto themselves just to do good. Those that do wish to join are directed to admissions officer Lloyd Swiftblade, who resides in Deningrad and operates out of the Resplendent Halls. Admission to the Shining Star requires not only physical fitness and magical aptitude for both combat and healing, but also tests one's moral compass by presenting situations wherein initiates are required to display their ability to act selflessly and altruistically; their ability to do all they can to save the innocent up to and including sacrificing themselves is a requirement for initiation. Once inducted as an initiate, they swear into a binding, magical oath to give everything they have to the greater good of the people. To slay evil where it must be slain, to temper justice with restraint and wisdom where evil need not be slain, to defend the weak and embolden others to do the same, to act with compassion and kindness, to live for others, and to live so that all others will feel comfort in their presence. Truly, it is the goal of the Shining Star that all good and lawful people who see their symbol charging forward are filled with confidence that they will be saved from the fear within their hearts to instead swell with comfort and confidence they will be safe; that each member be a hero in the eyes of the common folk.</p>
  
  <h2>Rank</h2>
  
  <p>The Shining Star Order uses its own ranking system which is primarily linear, with some notable exceptions, as depicted below. Note, while ranks may come with certain pieces of equipment, it is also possible for anyone within the SSO to be given equipment that may be deemed needed, or otherwise deserved. Anyone in the SSO may also pay their own gold to facilitate the services of the smiths that the SSO employs, for new weapons, armour, enchantments, or anything of the like. Thus, years of service under the SSO do tend to translate reliably to those more seasoned having better equipment.</p>
  
  <h3>Rankless</h3>
  
  <h2>Initiate</h2>
  <p>An initiate is someone freshly inducted into the Shining Star, who has completed training for their duties. If they do not already have their own set of armor, they are given scale mail which bears the symbol of the Shining Star upon its back. An initiate often travels in a group with a few other initiates and a Knight to learn, but are free to act independently if they so choose.</p>
  
  <h2>Ranked Soldiers</h2>
  
  <p>After the 90 day period of being an initiate, assuming the inductee survives, they are granted a soldier's rank. Soldiers in the SSO are frontline infantry, often used to do tasks most easily solved by a sword. It is not expected they have exceptional magical skill outside of the standard set forth by the SSO, and many of a soldier's tasks are physical in nature and delegated to them by a member of the Knight's Collective.
  
    <h3>Companion-At-Arms</h3>
  <p>A rank given to an initiate regardless of their performance after three months. They are identified by a magical stamp of rank being applied to their pauldrons which has a single, down-facing chevron. They are considered the lowest official rank, as initiates are viewed as being rankless, and as such hold no authority. Companion-At-Arms have authority over initiates only, and only insofar as their orders do not conflict with orders from a higher rank.</p>
  
    <h3>Corporal</h3>
  <p>A rank given to a Companion-At-Arms if they display a good attitude, initiative, and prove themselves able to help others. It may also be granted to an initiate if said initiate shows exemplary performance. their rank displays two downward facing chevrons imbued in their pauldrons.</p>
  
    <h3>Sergeant </h3>
  <p>A rank given to a Corporal if they display valor and leadership, quick thinking and adaptability, and embrace the values of the Shining Star fully. A Sergeant has a rank of thee chevrons, and is the highest rank a soldier can achieve. They typically are responsible for leading a group of two corporals and five Companion-At-Arms, leading to the standard group of eight soldiers per unit.</p>
  
  <h2>Knight's Collective</h2>
  
    <h3>Knight</h3>
  <p>A knight of the SSO is more exemplary of what the SSO embodies. They must fulfil all the duties of a soldier, showcase consistently they are capable and have a strong moral compass, and may even have their integrity tested intentionally by the SSO to ensure they are trustworthy. At this rank, they are given their own set of Half-Plate armor, which carries the SSO symbol on the back and bears the holy symbol of Crystellia sitting atop the SSO emblem on their pauldrons to indicate their rank. This emblem is known as the Knight's Mark, and is their symbol of rank. They are responsible for guiding initiates on top of their regular duties, and often act independently, or in leadership of a unit of eight soldiers.</p>
  
    <h3>Knight-Lieutenant</h3>
  <p>A rank above Knight, a Knight-Lieutenant bears one straight bar under their Knight's Mark, and have authority over other Knights. They are given their rank upon display of exceptional leadership above their station and are tasked with oversight of multiple Knight-led units, on top of their regular duties. A knight achieves this rank based on their leadership, and is expected to be given orders from their commanding officer and execute without oversight.</p>
  
    <h3>Knight-Captain</h3>
  <p>Usually the highest rank a Knight can attain, with two straight bars under their Knight's Mark, the Knight-Captains of the SSO generally receive orders either from officers, or from Aurora herself, as the Knight-Commander. A Knight-Captain is appointed by the Knight-Commander based on showcasing everything that is exemplified by the SSO in every facet of their duties and personal lives. A Knight-Captain is expected to take to the front lines in situations so dire that even soldiers of the SSO are told to retreat. To lay their lives on the line in the face of impossible odds is the duty of Knight-Captains, and as such like all Knights are feared throughout the land of Aetheria by those who live outside the law. A Knight-Captain is granted their own personal suit of full plate armour if they do not already own one.</p>
  
    <h3>Knight-Commander</h3>
  <p>The highest rank of the Knight's Collective, this rank can only have one person take its title, and the Knight Commander operates as the leader of the Knight's Collective and Soldier branches of the Shining Star Order. The Knight-Commander is appointed by Crystellia herself, and is expected to be unmatched in battle while being the ideal form of the Shining Star - what every other person in the Order should strive to be. The Knight-Commander is given the Holy Avenger - the powerful blade of righteousness that cuts through any evil - to execute their duties. With combat prowess already refined by years of combat, and the Holy Avenger in hand, the sight of the Knight-Commander is the last sight any evil-doer will see. They are given complete autonomy, and answer only to Crystellia.</p>
  
  <h2>Officer's Collective</h2>
  
    <h3>Marshall</h3>
  <p>A Marshall is the first of the officer ranks. Their Officer's Mark is a depiction of the holy artifact known as the Book of Exalted Deeds etched into their pauldrons, with Crystellia's holy symbol above it. Any member of the SSO may become a Marshall, and in doing so is not expected to accomplish the work outlined in missions of the SSO through the world. Instead, they are tasked with administrative work, deployed to areas to oversee branches of administration of the SSO in other nations. A Marshall may be the highest ranking SSO member in an SSO outpost, and passes orders primarily to sergeants and their units, or to the leading Knight if one exists for that unit. Though they are an officier, their authority is not absolute, and can be overruled by a Knight-Lieutennant if needed.</p>
  
    <h3>High Marshall</h3>
  <p>A High Marshall acts from the Lightsworn lands, receiving reports from multiple Marshalls in different lands, and reporting on things as situations evolve. A High Marshall is appointed by a Grand Marshall upon showcasing their leadership skills and demonstrable proof that their skills are best utilized closer to the administrative centre of the SSO, and undergo special training and mentorship under the Grand Marshalls to better their tactical understanding and magical abilities. Despite having an officier's rank, they are still expected to act as something of a royal guard, so regular training and the semi-regular foray into the field to keep their skills sharp remain part of their duties. Their Officer's Mark has one solid bar below it. </p>
  
  <h3>Grand Marshall</h3>
  <p>The Grand Marshalls of the SSO are the tactical overseers of all the operations within the SSO. Where there is logistical need, they will oversee. Their officer's mark has two solid bars below it, and is one of the most esteemed ranks within the SSO. The Grand Marshalls are expected to have learned an immense amount about the world, about combat, about criminals, about magic, and about the people below them in their time in the SSO, and so tend to be older. Their older age is belied by their apparent youth, which is blessed upon them by Crystellia. They must lead with an astute mind, a powerful soul resonant with magic, and ensure they collectively outwit any threat that is posed to the SSO in all the land.</p>
  
  <h3>Battlemaster</h3>
  <p>The Shining Star Order's Battlemaster is the administrative equal to the Knight Collective's Knight-Commander. There can be only one, who is appointed by Crystellia, and is tasked with exemplifying all the SSO strives to be, while also being a master of all tactics and military strategies. The current Battlemaster, Odric Sunsong, is a man who has never lost a game of strategy. He outsmarts every opponent he meets, often earning a surrender where he has broken his opponent's will without a single swing of his sword by simply positioning himself such that it becomes clear to his enemies that defeat is all but certain. However, should he need to fight, he is a man of immense magical strength, and at his command is the might of a nation that would rally behind him, just as they would for Aurora. He is a quiet man, observing twice as often as he speaks, but when he does speak is charismatic and kind; that, combined with how often he spends in his war room, makes it a frequent occurrence that people don't really know who he is when he speaks to initiates, and sometimes leaves impressions upon them that he is but just some Knight or Marshall, which he prefers to ensure that his words are taken to heart for their verisimilitude rather than for his rank.</p>
  
  <h2>Auxillery Ranks</h2>
  <p>The majority of administrative structure places SSO members in one of the listed ranks, but once in a while there is need for a specific alternative rank for someone who has a particular role within the SSO. These ranks typically carry similar authority to a Knight, with bars under their mark of rank indicating seniority in line with the ranks of similar prestige within the Knight's Collective. They are still referred to by their appropriate Knight title, but bear a slightly modified mark of rank. For example, a Knight-Captain who was given the rank of Spellbreaker would be refferred to as Spellbreaker-Knight-Captain. 
  
  <h3>Spellbreaker-Knight</h3>
  <p>The Spellbreakers in the SSO are a group of knights specifically experienced in subduing or killing mages. With magic so very common in Aetheria, great magical threats present at times. Spellbreakers train specifically with the ability to learn to interrupt casting of others, or make use of traps that temporarily disrupt the Aether in a given area so they can swiftly do what is necessary to subdue their target. At the discretion of the most seasoned Spellbreakers, a criminal may have their tongue cut out and hands chopped off if they are deemed too dangerous to allow to practice magic again, but are not to be put to death, should they, for example, have an enchantment that would cause ill effects to another person or people upon their death. They also work in studying magic, and develop new artifacts that are used to combat magic. Their mark of rank is an etching of a broken staff.</p>
  
  <h3>Lightbringer-Knights</h3>
  <p>Lightbringers are knights within the SSO that specialize more in their magic than in their martial prowess. They may brandish a staff, but do keep a longsword and dagger on their belts all the same. They also continue to don heavy armour, which requires special training in a discipline called War Casting to do effectively despite the restrictive nature of metal armour. Lightbringers employ primarily light-based spells, such as Faerie Fire and Guiding Bolt, but practice in varied disciplines of magic to ensure they are best able to handle any threat. Their mark of rank is a wand bearing Crystellia's holy symbol.</p>
  
  <h3>Lifegiver-Knights</h3>
  <p>Lifegivers are, as their name suggests, focused on healing and resurrection. They typically do not engage in combat, instead focusing on curing wounds, acting as a medic on the front lines, and in general healing the sick. They still wear armour and a weapon as any knight would, but typically do not use it unless needed. If they do need to, they are just as proficient with their blade and offensive magic as any Knight would be. Their mark of rank is a staff with two wings below Crystellia's shining star holy symbol.</p>
  
  <h3>Dragonrider-Knights</h3>
  <p>As the name suggests, these knights specialize in riding dragons. Naturally they can fight for themselves, but typically it is the dragon that is the more dangerous of the two. They are required to speak draconic, and are taught to ride a dragon's harness and be able to fight from dragon-back with spells. They establish a pair-bond with their dragon, and are usually deployed at times where an aerial threat approaches, or a particularly dangerous location requires siege. Their mark of rank is an armoured dragon's head facing straight with Crystellia's mark on the forehead armour plate of the depiction of the dragon.</p>
