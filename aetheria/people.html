  People
  </h2>
  
  <p>The annuls of history in Aetheria are filled with great people. Below, you'll find names of prominant characters broken down by their attunement. These names will also have an indication of their renown. Not every name here will be known to every person, even in their appropriate circles. Below you'll find names of public figures, as well as lesser known people whose name might leave the lips of many and might be known from growing up in the appropriate circle.
    
    <h2>
      Lightsworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Crystellia
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>Crystallia is the goddess of the Lightsworn people. She is a dragon of pure white scales, bright blue eyes, and a soothing, motherly voice, and typically also dons light armour with large sheets of gossamer on her body, mostly for ceremony. Like all of the Gods and Goddesses of the realm, she occasionally will turn to a human form. While it can differ based upon her will, her most known and preferred human form is a blonde woman, standing just under six foot, with bright blue eyes that remain strikingly draconic; she prefers to dress in gossamer robes, and remains very modest with her dress, despite her overwhelming beauty. She is depicted in paintings and stained glass portraits in either of her two forms. Those who wish to pray to her often visit the Monument of Light which sits outside the Crystal Palace, and pray and provide offerings to it. </p>
  
  <h3>
    Odric Sunsong
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: Most Lightsworn, anyone who is familiar with the Shining Star</p>
  
  <p>Odric Sunsong, often known as Battlemaster Odric, or Commander Odric, is the tactical mastermind behind the Shining Star Order. A tall human male who answers only to Crystellia herself, he is a genius tactician. He spends most of his time in Deningrad in the high offices of the Shining Star Order's headquarters, delegating orders to his generals. He is known to himself be a master of the longsword, as well as the light-based magic he weilds. He is a pious and devoted man, humble despite his rank, and embodies what the Shining Star strives to be.</p>
  
  <h3>
    Aurora Ser'ith
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: Most Lightsworn, anyone who is familiar with the Shining Star, feared by all criminals</p>
  
  <p>Aurora Ser'ith, Knight-Commander of the Shining Star Order, is an invaluable ally to have, and a death sentence of an enemy to make. She has made a name for herself among the Lightsworn as the face of the Shining Star Order. With her Holy Avenger in hand, she is ruthless and unmatched on the battlefield. Legions of monsters cower before her near godly might at the mere sight of her. She has been given many opportunities to act more as a general of the Shining Star, barking orders all day from horseback, and while she does do that, she also acts on the front lines. She does not fear anyone or anything, and leads her own personal group of fighters, known as Aurora's Chosen, into battles. Tales of her feats are sung by bards all around Aetheria, the truth of each tale up for debate. Aurora is known to be a humble woman who, despite her lifetime of accomplishment, does not place herself above the common folk. Wherever she goes, if there are people to help or evils to slay, she will never hesitate. Naturally, given she is not protected in the walls of a guarded city most of the time, assassins have long tried to make a name for themselves in claiming her head, but whether it be poison in her water or her throat slit in the night, legends tell of innumerable attempts that were thwarted without a scratch on the woman's beautiful face.</p>

  
  <h2>
      Firesworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Vythus
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>A dragon god who embodies fire in both spirit and body, his scales and eyes are a blazing red and the fire he breathes is known to replace desert sands with sheets of glass, liquefy obsidian, and leave those who oppose him reduced to ash; some even say that his mystical fire is enough to overcome magic designed to specifically combat flame, and as well has been said to be too hot even for infernal creatures who would typically be considered immune to flame. Of course, the truth of this matter isn't up for debate, as anyone who dares question the might of Vythus is quick to become a laughing stock of the entire nation. Ravith, the Tidesworn god dragon, is his brother. And it is believed that that is the only reason the two nations are not constantly at war with one another; those who follow Vythus' teachings know that family must always be one's closest allies, and to die protecting one's own family or brothers in arms is a hero's death, and those who die this way are carried to the great Monument of Flame to have their ashes added to the mausoleum of champions where they would earn a warrior's rest. </p>
  
  <h3>
    The Cerberus Royal Family
  </h3>
  <p>Lord Maxamillian Cerberus, Lady Elizabeth Cerberus, and Prince Theodore Cerberus. The Lord a human man who wears a red cape with golden lion pauldrons. The lady, a human vixen in a sleek red dress. The prince, a young human man eager to prove himself. The Cerberus royal family does not at all get along with the Vyra royal family. The two families clash on most every political issue, and though tentative peace remains between the two nations, as there's no real reason for their rivalry to create needless war even if it is occasionally threatened. Among their own nation, however, the Cerberus royal family has a bloodline that has been respected for ten generations. Though they administer law, that typically manifests as sending royal guards to seize a person who has wronged a Firesworn so the two may settle their dispute, often in a public forum. When the royal family intervenes, they will listen to both stories, and will then adjudicate appropriate restitution. Often, this leads to the offended party stating their demands for approval. Whether approved outright or adjusted, the demands are submitted to the wrong-doer, and if the condition - usually surrender of a sum of gold supplemented by their material possessions if they do not have enough coin - is met, then it is resolved. Else, if the wronged party remains unsatisfied, they are permitted to demand a duel, usually not permissible to be to the death unless it is egregious. To refuse this duel is punishable by imprisonment, or sometimes death; the Cerberus royal family delights in the spectacle of people fighting in this way, and it is a regular spectator event in Fyrn. The only exceptions to this are (sometimes) made for people traveling from other nations. Imposition of Firesworn law is still done, but typically this would see a demand of gold paid or the person imprisoned, rather than a duel.
  
  <h3>
    Magmiir Ironheart
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: Most Firesworn Smiths, many other blacksmiths through the land</p>
  
  <p>Magmiir is a dwarven man whose beard and hair is said to be naturally brown, but was stained black by the soot of the forge until it permenantly became so. Any who practice blacksmithing are likely to hear his name at least once. The leader of a lesser guild known as the Brothers of the Forge, he has produced innumerable masterworks. Talk of him carries word that he has grown bored of his trade, not able to find a challenge left for him. He still practices his craft, but any weapon he makes sells for what most smiths would consider a fortune, even those unenchanted. He usually is the smith hired by the House of Champions when a new Keyrune Holder requires work done on their weapons or armor, or if a new item entirely is to be made. No stranger to combat himself, he favours a greataxe in battle, and is known to don a set of full plate mail made out of an enchanted alloy of Mithril and Adamantine that makes mundane weapons shatter on impact with it.</p>

  
    <h2>
      Skysworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Avira
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>A bubbly, friendly and oftentimes silly goddess, Avira is known primarily for her blinding speed. Like the winds, she is able to soar through the air with impossible speed. Her body is a pale blueish-white, and she is comparatively diminutive to many other dragons. Her eyes are a bright cerulean, and carry a sympathetic comfort that brings great happiness to many Skysworns who interact with her. She can often be found lounging with other citizens, sleeping, or being playfully mischievous; in the unlikely event she is confronted, she often enjoys playing with her opponent, and may not even deliver a killing blow if she gets bored of the fight. Some describe her as playfully aloof, others as the little sister of the world. Regardless, she is known to take human (or elven, dwarven, etc) form more than any other of the god dragons for the express purpose of pulling pranks. Thankfully, she's notoriously bad at keeping secrets, and the pranks she does successfully pull off are usually out of the good spirit of the to-be-pranked, believing it all to be in good fun, as it always is when it comes to Avira. </p>
  
  <h3>
    The Vyra Royal Family
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Skysworn, any politically aware Aetherians</p>
  
  <p>King Allus Vyra, Queen Talia Vyra, Princess Azura Vyra. Each of them kind and generous, ruling over the Skysworn people for nearly thirty years in the current generation, with a bloodline stretching back several hundred years. All human, and masters of air-aligned magics. Allus is a slightly rotund man, jolly and easy to please, and while lenient on many has been known to crack down on people he believes harbour ill will. Despite many feeling in the company of a friend among him, he rules with no hesitance for punishing the wicked. Talia, queen of the people, is motherly and aristocratic. Very fine in taste, she is an artist whose works are coveted by all Skysworn people. To own an original of hers is a mark of significant status in the artistic community. She weighs in on the rule of law, but primarily as it concerns the more social aspects of the kingdom, such as how much of the royal treasury is given to pay for the construction of monuments, or what ceremonies are appropriate for Skysworn holidays, even dictating rules on who is permitted to handle cultivation of the nation's national flower - the Sky Rose. Azura, the princess, was known to be a happy, pleasant child that enjoyed playing with the common folk. Humble and sweet, she was beloved by all she met. However, in recent years, her disposition has turned sour. Since her sixteenth birthday, she has steadily receded into the castle, and for the two years since her eighteenth birthday, has refused to leave the castle for any reason, with rumours saying she even goes months without leaving her room at all. Where she might have once appeared regularly at ceremony, it has become common to guess at what justification Allus gives for her absence each time. Be it illness, other obligation, or some other excuse, it's been clear to many for a long time that the king lies about these excuses quite poorly, though people have stopped questioning it in general.
  

  
    <h2>
      Earthsworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Grygonith
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>To say Grygonith is the strong silent type is a grave understatement. A dragon of brown scales that sit below a rocky, earthen shell, he never speaks to the denizens of his lands. He listens, and he acts, showing that he does understand those who speak to him, but it is believed that only the other god dragons and Eria are able to get him to speak. He has an 'older brother' style relationship with Avira, despite there being no blood ties, and by extension it is known that any military threat against the Skysworn is a military threat against the Earthsworn. Grygonith is able to shake and crack the earth below him with only his footfalls if he so desires, and can will himself to sizes that make even colossal beasts look like rats below him. His draconic bellows can be heard throughout the entirety of the realm, and those that seek to disturb nature will earn his ire. It's also rumoured that he allows Earthsworns to rest on him so long as they remain respectfully quiet, but despite this rumour, nobody claims to have actually done so. </p>
  
  <h3>
    Eria
  </h3>
  
  <p>Known among: All Earthsworn, a fair percentage of other Aetherians</p>
  
  <p>Eria, the Earth Mother, sometimes called the Matriarch, is the defacto leader of the Earthsworn below Grygonith, said to be the only one who can speak to him. She is a beautiful Wood Elf, said to be well over six hundred years old, and is a master of all earth-aligned magic. It is said that flowers bloom at her feet where she walks, and a single touch can purify even the most putrid swampwaters. She seeks to preserve all beauty that nature provides, and executes the will of Grygonith. Skeptics say she acts in her own interest and misrepresents what Grygonith says, being the only one who can speak to him - which some believe to also be a false claim - but others say that if she were misleading the Earthsworn people so, that Grygonith would crush her under the might of his fist without hesitation. Thus, most believe the truth is that she truly is altruistic, and seeks the best for all Earthsworn people.</p>

      Tidesworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Ravith
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>Ravith, blood brother to Vythus, the Firesworn God, is a dragon with vibrant blue scales and icy blue eyes, has little patience for ineptitude, and can often be heard (reluctantly) discussing with less intelligent creatures in a dismissive, sarcastic, and condescending manner. Granted, it's often witty and done with enough subtlety that the offending party doesn't often realize they are being mocked, but it's almost a pastime for scholars to gather when Ravith decides to humour someone who truly has no business speaking to him. As much as such a reputation might make him sound like a ill-tempered person, he to the contrary quite calm and pleasant. His mind does not offer much emotional sympathy, however, and instead operates on a very pragmatic track. He rewards those who discover new things in the arcane with an absurd amount of wealth and whatever else they might desire, being that he as a god cares little for material possessions, and even those who become clerics or paladins in his name often bolster themselves with arcane spells more than anything else. An adept mage with a full spellbook is his ideal follower, and he makes time for all else only because he understands the need for those more physically adept (until whatever it is they are needed for can be solved with magic, anyway). On the whole, he is kind natured, but not someone one should ever complain to without demonstrable proof of need for his intervention in some way. (Otherwise, of course, they should have bothered someone else.)</p>

  
    <h2>
      Thundersworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Syvian
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>Syvian, self-proclaimed leader of the group of the seven dragon deities of Aetheria, is a charismatic and charming being who spends much of her time among her people. She takes pride in seeing nobody left behind, and seeks to empower those who lack confidence or are less fortunate to claim their own destiny, believing strongly that a world full of strong-willed and intelligent people will shape the world into a utopia by the natural order of things. It hasn't worked out as expected thus far, but she is nothing if not persistent. Not a great deal is known about her, primarily because many nations don't deal with Thundersworns as a general rule, and Thundersworns in general have little to offer tourists. Syvian also has not officially recognized any guilds (what few there have been) as a House within her lands, and so they remain the only nation without one. </p>
  
  <h3>
    Novus
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Thundersworn, many politics-conscious Aetherians</p>
  
  <p>Emporor Novus is an enigma of a man. Always appearing in public wearing garb that fully conceals him, he makes public declarations from the safety of his castle. Typically, he appears only to address matters of public interest that have remained unresolved, throwing out an authoritative hand to the nation to have the final say and put to rest the squabbles to try and achieve unity among the people. Though he carries the title of emporor, and indeed is the face of authority to other nations, he interacts (or interferes, as some would characterize it) little with the people. Rumours about him suggest he has disfiguring wounds all over his face, which is why he keeps himself concealed. Others say he lives among the people, but can't allow himself to be recognized, lest he be target of assassination. Others still say he's just...Weird. Regardless of rumour, he has displayed his mastery of lightning magic in the past, and none question his skill with a rapier.</p>
  

  
    <h2>
      Shadowsworn
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Rythern
  </h3>
  <p>Known among: All Aetherians </p>
  <p>Rythern is just as cryptic as her followers, and often elects to remain silent when dealing with most anyone until they realize she isn't going to tell them whatever it is they want to know, unless of course she wants to share, or cares so little that it matters not if she shares. She enjoys her solitude, but welcomes any who seek her shelter. Disturbing her, or threatening her followers, will easily see one's own brain melted out their ears courtesy of a magical brain-punch or perhaps a more robust 'Power Word: Kill'. She cares little about objections from others - regardless of status - regarding the practise, creation and furthering of taboo magics. She believes firmly that to advance into the future, one must understand the mistakes of the past. The First Era is one of her primary concerns, but before that she seeks to provide sanctuary for all her followers and ensure their well-being, even going so far as to patrol streets of populated cities when the clocks approach midnight to round people up and bring them somewhere safe so they will not fall pray to the dangers of the night. Her followers universally adore her, and she in kind cherishes them greatly.</p>
