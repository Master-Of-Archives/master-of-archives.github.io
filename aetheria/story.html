<h2>
  The Story So Far
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Prologue
  </h3>
  <p>Aetheria was once a plane entirely isolated from other planes in the multiverse. It could not be accessed by any gate, any portal, any dimensional rift. It was sequestered in its own little corner of the multiverse. But one day as average as any other, something changed, and suddenly people from within the realm were able to leave the realm, and people outside the realm started finding ways in. Whether they were thrust there without intending to arrive, arrived by accident, or had seen the presence of a new place in exploring the multiverse, people began to arrive from other places. Significant time has passed since that event, lending to the initial shock of people coming to the realm - usually referred to as 'outsiders' or 'outlanders' - subsiding. People still have their opinions about outsiders - some good, some bad. But life has gone on. It has risen to a rise in more mixed races, though the prominant races - Human, Elf, Half-elf, Dwarf, Halfling - remain the dominant races through the world, though mixed races always had existed as a rarity.</p>
  
  <p>Now, in present-day Aetheria, there exist 'nodes' where outsiders arrive, which have had teleportation gates crafted around them, and are constantly guarded by members of the Shining Star Order. They answer questions new arrivals might have, and generally assess if the people arriving are well-meaning or not as best as one can. There certainly have been more than a few who present pleasantly at first only to go on to commit crimes after arrival, just as any Aetherian-born criminal would. Life goes on, the gods of the realm continue to preside over their nations, and study resumes on this extraplanar magic.</p>
