  <h2>
    Attunement
  </h2>
  <p>When a baby is born in Aetheria, they are born into a world of magic. From the moment of birth, the Aether suffuses them, though it does not unlock their magical 'spark' by itself. There is a rite that all Aetherian-born people undergo at the age of sixteen known as 'Attunement'. Usually conducted by a cleric or acolyte of the specific diety, it is as much a religious ceremony as it is a practical one. When someone decides to which god(dess) they wish to worship, often but not always in line with that of their parents, they are brought to a temple of that god(dess). The rite is performed differently for each nation, but the primary effects are that it will ignite the magical spark of the Aetherian if theirs is not already ignited, and will fill their soul with the mana of the chosen diety. For most people, this doesn't affect their magic, or their day to day lives much, and serves as a primarily religious significance. The holy symbol of their diety is a common sight to see people wearing on their clothes, pendants, armor, or the like.</p>
  
  <p>What this means is that even those who do not study magic - fighters, monks, smiths, caravaneers, wanderers - can still be expected to have some control over magic. For many fighters, this is typically manifested in them being able to infuse their weapons or armor with their specific type of mana. Firesworns might set their sword ablaze, or a Tidesworn might harden their plate mail with magical ice that resists the bite of steel, or a Skysworn might send surges of airy mana through their clothes to make their motions more fluid and expedient. More specific details for each type are listed below.</p>
  
  <p>Note, that which is listed below typically only manifests at greater 'depths' of attunement, which is typical only for those most devoted to their specific element / diety. It is left intentionally vague as to let each writer decide to what degree their character's natural affinity presents in these changes. All characters have an aura, but to see it requires the character cast a very specific spell, which is <b>not widely known</b>.</p>
  

 
  <h2>Lightsworn</h2>
  Goddess: Crystellia<br>
  Aura colour: White<br>
  Holy Symbol: A golden, four-pointed star oriented straight, not diagonally.<br><br>
  
 
<p>Lightsworns gain a slight boon to healing they cast. Crystellia's magic is potent, and courses through the soul of the caster, making their healing slightly more prominent than that of other attunements, all things equal. Moreover, spells that create or produce light come more naturally, and particularly powerful Lightsworn beings can channel their aura to shed light around them that dispels illusions near them and has effects to frighten and turn undead. On the inverse, Lightsworns have a greater difficulty using magic that creates undead (though, RESSURECTION magic comes more naturally, even if it remains something that is only possible for the most powerful of Lightsworns in the first place) and find it maddeningly difficult to create magical darkness, in general.</p>
 
  <h2>Firesworn</h2>
  God: Vythus<br>
  Aura colour: Red<br>
  Holy Symbol: A red orb with a stylized symbol of flame within; the orb is occasionally depicted as a sun.<br><br>
 
<p>Firesworns are, of course, adept at all fire magic. Their flames burn hotter, and it comes naturally for many to imbue their blades with flames by just channelling the magic of their aura into their weapon. The magic of their attunement makes them harder to keep down, and they typically have a higher pain threshold for physical wounds as their aura grows stronger. Moreover, if one achieves the highest levels of attunement to their fiery aura, spells of other elements will manifest as being flames instead. Cone of Cold, for example, would become a cone of flames instead. Likewise, it tends to make those with higher depth more resilient to flames of all kinds, and even people newly inducted to the Firesworn attunement find themselves able to tolerate much higher temperatures, while growing cold much more easily. An aptitude for fire magic tends to make the cold easy enough to stave off, however.</p>
 
  <h2>Skysworn</h2>
  Goddess: Avira<br>
  Aura colour: Cyan<br>
  Holy Symbol: The silhouette of a bird with its wings spread in an upward curve, talons usually not depicted<br><br>
  
 
<p>Skysworns have a natural adeptness to motion. As one's depth into the Skysworn attunement grows, they find it easier to channel magic into their movements to run faster, leap higher, and in general achieve feats of acrobatic dexterity that would - and indeed does - astound audiences. Controlling themselves in midair is second-nature, and spells that align with the winds become much more easy to control and handle as they grow in attunement to Avira's magic. This can on semi-rare occasions make Skysworns, regardless of depth, feel a little restless, and it's not uncommon to see Skysworn people running together for fun. Spells that restrict movement, paralyse or otherwise go against this nature of being free and swift do not come as easily to a Skysworn, so spells like Hold Person are often not found in the spellbooks of Skysworn mages.</p>
 
 
  <h2>Earthsworn</h2>
  God: Grygonith<br>
  Aura colour: Green<br>
  Holy Symbol: A green orb with the silhouette of a tree.<br><br>
 
<p>Earthsworns promote growth and harmony. Spells that align with the creation of food, harmony with animals and nature, and taking on aspects of nature (such as Polymorph and Speak with Animals) become easier for Earthsworns to master. Their skin tends to harden against injury as they grow deeper into their attunement, and scaling or descending from natural formations becomes easier; their grip tends to get more secure, and their ability to carry heavy loads increases. Spells that conjure or move earth and stone come more easily, while spells aligned with flame or decay become harder to grasp, and are often frowned upon anyway.</p>
 
  <h2>Tidesworn</h2>
  God: Ravith<br>
  Aura colour: Blue<br>
  Holy Symbol: A blue orb with a snowflake depicted within<br><br>
 
<p>Tidesworns have a natural aptitude towards a great deal of magic. Wizardry and Sorcery come more naturally to them, and logic and numbers make more sense than they would for many others. They are better able to withstand lower temperatures, while higher ones make them fatigued more quickly. At great depths, spells that align to other elements take on either a water or ice element to them, but as with all changes to spell natures, this only presents at the utmost harmony with one's attunement. Fireballs become explosions of cold air and shards of ice, lightning bolts become instantaneous bolts of ice suffused with cold, arcane energy, and so on. They are more adept at holding their breath, and find water does not impede their motion quite as much. As well, the practises of Divination (seeing the future through visions, scrying, etc) come more naturally to a Tidesworn.</p>
 
  <h2>Thundersworn</h2>
  Goddess: Syvian<br>
  Aura colour: Violet<br>
  Holy Symbol: Two golden crossed swords<br><br>
 
<p>Thundersworns have an aptitude for magic that strikes quickly. Teleportation, lightning and thunder-based spells come more easily, and they themselves can become conduits for lightning. They do not become immune to lightning, but their own conjured lightning can pass through them without harm quite soon after attuning to Syvian's mana. Their reflexes are also improved, and Monks of the Thundersworn monasteries often practise a mastery of missile-snaring (that is, catching arrows and the like out of mid-air). When completely attuned, spells of other elements often take on electrical elements in place of their natural one. Fireballs become a explosive, volatile sphere of electrical energy. Things normally inert like Wind Wall gain a biting electrical field, and spells like Thunderclap and Thunderous Smite become that much more deafening.</p>
 
  <h2>Shadowsworn</h2>
  Goddess: Rythern<br>
  Aura colour: Black<br>
  Holy Symbol: A black ankh<br><br>
 
<p>Shadowsworns have an aptitude for creating shadows, concealing themselves, and vanishing. Illusions are more natural for them, and most everyone who is Shadowsworn has keen low-light vision. This means that blinding lights affect them more, but it usually isn't strong enough of a difference to matter. They are able to cloak themselves in shadows effortlessly at higher attunements, and Shadowsworn mages have developed healing rituals and spells that heal more effectively in complete darkness. Moreover, they are able to perform many magical feats with their own blood, and blood in general is a sacred thing to many Shadowsworns. They also develop 'blindsense' at great depths of attunement, allowing them to perceive beings near them without sight or sound, though this range is typically very limited, and those that can do it often can't extend their blindsense beyond a handful of feet. Finally, at higher depths, they gain the ability to pass near instantly from one shadow to the next (though doing so excessively will tire them quickly) with naught but a few wispy lines of shadow to dictate their passing.</p>
