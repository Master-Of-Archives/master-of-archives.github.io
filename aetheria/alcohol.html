<h2>
  Getting Drunk!
  </h2>
  
  <p>Who doesn't love getting totally wasted in a tavern and breaking out into a bar-brawl? Civil folk, that's who!</p>
  
  <p>Below is a list of common and nation-specific brews of alcohol for all to enjoy. Do note that common drinks are typically the same price no matter where you get them, but almost every inn and tavern has their own set of special wares. Prices generally cater to buying single cups or drinks, with some drinks being available in bottles of various sizes that often incur a premium price, as they are intended to be taken home rather than enjoyed within the inn or tavern.</p>
 
 <p>If you need a refresher on what coinage is used:</p>
 
CP = Copper Piece<br>
SP = Silver Piece<br>
GP = Gold Piece<br>
PP = Platinum Piece<br>
 <br>
10 cp = 1sp<br>
10 sp = 1gp<br>
10gp = 1pp<br>
 
<h2>Common Fare</h2>
 
<h3>Ale</h3>
[Gallon] - 2sp<br>
[Mug] - 4cp<br>
Your standard ale. Bottoms up! Strength varies by region, but not by much.<br>
 
<h3>Wine, common</h3>
[Pitcher] - 2sp<br>
[Glass] - 5cp<br>
Common wine. Fruity with a local flavour. Typically not aged for much more than a year. Served in a pitcher<br>
 
<h3>Rice Wine</h3> 
[Bottle] - 4sp<br>
Wine fermented from rice grains. A decent bit stronger than regular grape wine, with a stronger kick.<br>
 
<h3>Elven Wine</h3> 
[Bottle] - 10gp<br>
[Glass] - 4gp<br>
Wine brewed specifically among elvish circles using carefully cultivated grapes and often aged for a long period of time in excess of ten years; given the long lifespan of elves, an elf could see to the growth, bottling and ageing of wines that exceed even as much as 500 years, with a more full flavour embodying the wine with age thanks to the careful attention to it.<br>
 
<h3>Mead </h3>
[Mug] - 5cp<br>
[Gallon] - 2gp<br>
Honey-wine. Commonly distributed and made wherever people are thirsty.<br>
 
<h3>Dwarven Firewater </h3>
[Mug] - 3sp<br>
[Bottle] - 10gp<br>
A strong, purified alcohol, flavoured and distilled to provide an intense burn, which gives it its name. Is a favourite among dwarves who are looking to get drunk quickly, but can be enjoyed casually as well, as the usual ale will often fill their gullets before they get too tipsy.<br>
 
<h3>Rum</h3> 
[Mug] - 1sp<br>
[Bottle] - 8gp<br>
Your standard rum, often distilled from sugarcane molasses, and barrel-aged for a year or two.<br>
 
<h3>Tea</h3> 
[Common, cup] - 2cp<br>
[Common, pot] - 8cp<br>
A common drink made with herbal leaves soaked in near-boiling water then cooled briefly. Can be served hot or cold. Non-alcoholic.<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>Nation Specific Wares</h2>
 
<p>A list of drinks common to specific nations, denoted in the brackets. Be aware that the drinks CAN be found elsewhere, but would have to be in a place that imports or otherwise receives trade from the land in question.</p>
 
 
<h3>[Tidesworn] Wizard's Brew </h3>
[Cup] - 1sp<br>
<p>A brew of very slightly alcoholic spirits and liqueurs that is fermented in an enchanted wooden barrel. Has a crisp hint of ginger. While it is a little expensive, it is very popular as it is known to be very swift at relieving headaches and can be enjoyed in large quantities without impairing one's judgement. It also improves mental clarity in small doses, but paradoxically, the drink without the alcohol has been proven to be far less effective. Often served chilled, and has a mystical white mist that persists at the top of the cup.<p>
 
 
<h3>[Tidesworn, Skysworn] Pixie Punch </h3>
[Cup] - 5cp<br>
A fruity, non-alcoholic drink that is named after the small fey creatures of the forest. It has a very rich taste, but is a staple at parties for those who prefer not throwing up but are still very thirsty. Bubbly, with layers of different fruits, it is often also used as a mixer for hard spirits for those who DO want to throw up after drinking all night.
 
<h3>[Firesworn] Dragon Breath Ale </h3>
[Mug] - 4sp

<p>An ale specific to the Firesworn, it is an ale that is brewed with the extract of a magical flower known as the Dragon Plume. It has a heavy froth, and a thick texture. It also is powerful enough to knock people out if they aren't prepared, and brings new meaning to the word 'burn' when drinking. As with many things in Firesworn culture, it is often the subject of pride to quaff an entire stein of this ale in one breath and not succumb to what has often been described as 'liquid fire'. The average Firesworn will be drunk after two mugs of this, if they can stomach it (which most can't). Popular with drinking contests, as every consecutive stein gets worse and worse, to the point people either retch, pass out, or, in semi-rare occasions, succumb to violent seizures. Almost never fatal, however, unless speaking of the imbiber's ego.</p>

 
<h3>[Earthsworn, Shadowsworn, Tidesworn, Skysworn] Midnight Absinthe </h3>
[Cup] - 5sp<br>
<p>A potent beverage, it is uncommon to be bought but does tend to be kept in stock in most taverns in the regions it is made. Causes the imbiber to hallucinate when they drink any significant amount, with the intensity increasing as the imbiber grows more and more inebriated.</p>
 
<h3>[Lightsworn] Brightwater</h3>
[Glass] - 1sp<br>
[Bottle] - 12gp<br>
<p>An alcoholic drink that is very slightly medicinal in its properties. It has a very soft and soothing taste, and many who drink this find themselves asleep before drunk. Said to be impossible to get a hangover from it, it contains the oil of the Shimmeroot plant that only grows in regions with a large excess of light mana. In absence of proper healing means, it's been rumoured that this drink can be just medicinal enough to sterilise and stabilize war wounds, as well as calm the wounded person if applied directly to a wound. Despite these rumours, it is not advised by anyone with a shred of sanity to be used this way unless there is no other choice.</p>
 
<h3>[Thundersworn, Firesworn, Skysworn] Gambler's Grog </h3>
[Mug] - 5sp<br>
<p>A smooth and tasty combination of a mixture of alcohols, it is a favourite among gamblers - hence its name. It is said to increase somenoe's luck, but that is widely understood as being entirely absurd. Still, the superstition persists and it is served wherever cards and dice are housed.</p>
 
 
<h3>[Firesworn, Skysworn] Siegward's Secret Top-Shelf Ale </h3>
[Mug] - 1gp<br>
<p>Often times called Siegward's ale to save the time of it's needlessly long name, Siegward's ale is a recipe that was passed down by a brewmaster by the same name who was a Firesworn man that loved a good toast. Its taste is second-to-none for those who enjoy their ale, but is extremely pricey for it. Typically only enjoyed by nobles, it is a sign of a rich party-host to have this on offer for their party guests. Smooth and impossible to get ill or regret drinking the next morning, it isn't called 'top shelf' for nothing.</p>
 
<h3>[Thundersworn] Thunderbrew </h3>
[Mug] - 8sp<br>
<p>A drink popular among Thundersworn, it is an energizing drink that has a slight hit of alcohol. Drink of choice for soldiers or those looking to forget their worries, it's very commonly drank by those who are training or would rather get right back to life after an exhausting journey, rather than sleeping it off.</p>
 
<h3>[Skysworn, Lightsworn] Golden Dragon Gin </h3>
[Mug] - 5sp<br>
<p>A golden berry spirit, it has a strong kick and is a staple for middle-class folk. Often mixed with one's non-alcoholic drink of choice. Enjoyed in much larger quantities in the Skysworn lands than in the Lightsworn.</p>

 
<h3>[Earthsworn] Blossom Spirits </h3>
[Bottle] - 15gp<br>
<p>A red liqueur brewed specifically in the Earthsworn lands, it is potent and quite bitter if drunken straight. Concocted with rare plants that grow only in lush and verdant groves far removed from civilization, it is an additive to other drinks that imbue an extremely potent sense of relaxation. Many brewmasters will create their own house drinks with blossom spirits. Said to let someone fall into a trance that lets them commune with nature, it is not kind on the wallet for any drink that has a proper mix of blossom spirits but something people are happy to pay if they seek an escape and remedy for their mortal woes.</p>
 
<h3>[Skysworn] Tea of the Mists</h3>
[Cup] - 10gp<br>
[Pot] - 50gp<br>
<p>A tea favoured by the Vyra royal family, often requested as a 'cup of mist', it is a collection of delicate floral and herbal components with a dash of magical powders. Something that excites all of the most delectable taste-centres of the palette, it is often bought by wealthly nobles for special occasions like birthdays. Cultivation is nigh impossible for all but the most skilled botanists and even more difficult to gather into sachets in the perfect proportions so that it is made properly - with too much or too little of any one ingredient throwing off the whole flavour. As such, it is almost exclusively prepared by masters of both mixing and botany who tend to be employed by the royal family, or other lords and ladies of higher prominence. Common folk almost never hear of this drink, let alone drink it.</p>
