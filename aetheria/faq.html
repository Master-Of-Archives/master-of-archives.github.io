    FAQ
  </h2>
  
  <p>This page is dedicated to making character creation as straight-forward as possible. Below, you'll find profile templates to use on RPC, as well as answers to questions that might arise during creation to help be aligned with other characters. They may be phrased more as questions to ask yourself than direct answers, but should help keep everyone on around the same page.</p>

  <h2>
    Do I have to use the templates?
  </h2>
  
  <p>No. They are there for your convenience. You are free to make your own profile to participate. You can contact the master profile if you want to include any lore-appropriate symbols or images in your own work.</p>
  
    <h2>
    What does 'Attunement' mean?
  </h2>
  
  <p>See <a href="attunement.html">[here]</a> </p>
  
    <h2>
    Does my character have to be born in Aetheria to participate and/or be attuned?
  </h2>
  
  <p>No, outsider characters who fit a fantasy setting are welcome, but those who are looking to power-trip are not. Characters joining should be looking to adventure, which means that they should be on the lower end of the spectrum for character power. Magic is abundant in Aetheria, and your character will be magical, and they certainly will be stronger than common folk, but all characters should start out their adventuring career as an average adventurer. In D&D terms, this would place a character around levels 1 - 7 at most, with preference towards lower levels. If a character has nothing to do, no way to grow, then they won't have any reason to do anything, and might as well not exist at all. Give your character a reason to adventure. Give them weakness. Give them a speicalty, a combat style, but keep let's all experience their ascent to a hero of the realm together, instead of in a lore-dump.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can my character start as part of a guild/House?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Yes, but only as an initiate or guildmage at most. It also may be more interesting to start outside the guild, and make joining part of their story that we all can enjoy. More info on guilds <a href="guilds.html">[here]</a></p>
  
    <h2>
    I don't know D&D lore. Can I still participate?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Of course! The setting is adapted from D&D, but is by and large in line with the usual high-fantasy genre. You can find out anything you'd need to know by reading through the expanded lore, or asking questions. </p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I play one of the gods? Or just any god? Or some super important character in established lore?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Gods: No. The seven god(dess)s are played by the master profile. They have very specific nuance to their character, and what they choose to do and when to interfere is very much something that must remain tightly controlled. Their general unavailability most of the time is due to their godly status. While many people may meet their own god, plenty others have never. Other characters in lore, however, may be permitted to be written by other characters, but only once it's clear the writer has a firm grasp on the lore and can play the specific character appropriately without derailing the story.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Is there an overarching story?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Very much so. It will be told through many different adventures, though not all adventures will necessarily be part of the main story. Sometimes you just want to kill an evil wizard to say you've done that.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I play an evil character?
  </h2>
  
  <p>It would be preferrable not to, though there is no hard 'no' to be found here.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I fight with other characters? Is there a standard combat system?
  </h2>
  
  <p>The combat system preferred is most in line with <a href="https://theunofficialofficialrulesofroleplay.weebly.com/terminology-t1-t2-t3.html">[T1 style]</a> outlined on that link, which is what most people are used to. Each character takes a turn in the round, and gets to do whatever is reasonable in what would be considered a reasonable time frame for an action, usually restricted to one attack per post. However, keep in mind that this is not intended to be restrictive, and more of a guideline. Killing other characters is very highly discouraged, and should only be done with explicit permission from the writer. Fighting to the point one party goes unconscious or retreats and is declared the loser is more in line with what player vs. player interactions should look like. Death is very much a reality in the world, however, but for the sake of keeping things respectful and civil between all players, deadly scenarios should always be either as part of an adventure, or with clear understanding from all participants that death is a potential outcome. In the event of any uncertainty, err on the side of non-lethal outcomes, and respect the other writers.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Aetheria is a big world. How do we know where everyone else is?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Reading posts would be the best way, but it also makes sense to put where your character is generally in your status.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Why don't the gods just fix all the problems people have if they live among them?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Gods are powerful beings, but their position of power comes with a responsibility. An invading army of evil, otherworldly beings would certainly be met with godly wrath. But the local raiders pillaging a city? There are more important things on a god's radar. Most of the time, the gods are nowhere to be found. Special events may see one or more of them arriving at a certain place, or they may be found at random, but despite living among the people they aren't all that much easier to contact than a regular god outside of, as mentioned, random chance or specific events where their presence is pre-planned.</p>
