    FAQ
  </h2>
  
  <p>This page is dedicated to making character creation as straight-forward as possible. Below, you'll find profile templates to use on RPC, as well as answers to questions that might arise during creation to help be aligned with other characters. They may be phrased more as questions to ask yourself than direct answers, but should help keep everyone on around the same page.</p>

  <h2>
    Do I have to use the templates?
  </h2>
  
  <p>No. They are there for your convenience. You are free to make your own profile to participate. You can contact the master profile if you want to include any lore-appropriate symbols or images in your own work.</p>
  
  <h2>Is there some XP system?</h2>
  
  <p>Not any that is tracked. This is not a D&D game. However, it is understood that as a character adventures, they get stronger. Using their magic makes them able to use stronger magic. Practice with a sword makes them more adept. Pilfering hoards of treasure gives them access to greater weapons and armour, usually by way of being able to pay for a well-reknowned artisan or smith to make it for them, or by finding it among the treasures of a dungeon. Instead, decide how your character grows after each adventure. It should be a steady, logical progression. There should be no rush to become crazy strong - because at that point, your character might as well retire. Treat learning new spells or abilities not as a way to min-max your character, but as stepping stones in their journey, important memories to be formed, and wonderful or tragic RP moments in the making.</p>
  
  <p>If you wish to track something related to character progression, consider tracking their material possessions and/or known spells and abilities. It makes for a well-fleshed out character sheet. When it comes to character power level, try to think more about what memorable moments you can tie to a character's advancement, rather than them advancing for advancement's sake. Not every encounter with a goblin will allow them to learn anything, but standing in an arena and going toe-to-toe with Vythus would certainly leave a character with useful knowledge (and probably several nearly fatal wounds) to better enhance their sword technique.
  
    <h2>
    What does 'Attunement' mean?
  </h2>
  
  <p>See <a href="attunement.html">[here]</a> </p>
  
  <h2>What races exist in Aetheria?</h2>
  
  <p>While there is no major restrictions on race, the most populous races are Humans, Elves, Half-elves, Dwarves, and Halflings. Tieflings, half-Orcs, Dragonborn, Aasimar, Tabaxi, Goliaths, and other exotic races do exist, particularly with outsider arrivals, but are highly uncommon. As well, while Drow exist and may wander among the civil world, they are often outcast for their typical evil natures, and an attuned, civilized Drow would be an extreme rarity, and as such would be met commonly with scorn.  </p>
  
  <h2>
    I don't know D&D lore. Can I still participate?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Of course! The setting is adapted from D&D, but is by and large in line with the usual high-fantasy genre. You can find out anything you'd need to know by reading through the expanded lore, or asking questions. <b>However!</b> Some important things to be aware of, specifically for races:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>For Elves: Elves (not half-elves) do not age at the same rate as other races. They live up to 750 years, and generally accept adulthood for themselves around 100 years old. Elves (not half-elves) also <b>do not sleep</b>, but instead perform a 'trance' for four hours a night, which involves deep meditation. Elves (and half-elves) also have an accepted resiliance to being magically charmed, and cannot magically be put to sleep. Elves and half-elves have a natural ability to see better in the dark, known as 'darkvision'.</li>
    <li>For Dwarves: Like Elves, Dwarves do not age at the same pace. They live to be around 350 years old, and are generally considered mature around 50. They also have natural darkvision, and Dwarves are generally accepted to be resistant to poison.</li>
    <li>For Halflings: Like the others, they live longer. Halflings live to be around 250 years old. They also are generally accepted to be a very small bit luckier than your average person, though it could be easily dismissed as superstition.</li>
    <li><b>Languages</b>: All characters will speak what is known as <b>Common</b>, though with the influence of Outsiders will also accept 'English' as the standard name for the language. <b>Other languages exist</b> in Aetheria, however! Some examples include Dwarvish, Elvish, Halfling, Draconic, and many, many more than can be listed here. When an NPC is speaking in another language, it will be stated in prose. <b>Unless otherwise documented on the character's profile, or dealing with an innate racial language, it is assumed your character can speak Common and no other languages</b>.</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What is the technology level of the world?</h2>
  
  <p>Typical high-fantasy tech levels. Wooden carts, horse-drawn transportation, buildings made usually of wood and stone. Eccentric tinkerers may produce new inventions, like handheld pistols that shoot firebolts using the user's mana, or even go so far as to make something akin to the fabled Apparatus of Kwalish, but these would be extremely exceptional. Characters engaging in room must adhere to a high-fantasy setting.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Does my character have to be born in Aetheria to participate and/or be attuned?
  </h2>
  
  <p>No, outsider characters who fit a fantasy setting are welcome, but those who are looking to power-trip are not. Characters joining should be looking to adventure, which means that they should be on the lower end of the spectrum for character power. Magic is abundant in Aetheria, and your character will be magical, and they certainly will be stronger than common folk, but all characters should start out their adventuring career as an average adventurer. In D&D terms, this would place a character around levels 1 - 7 at most, with preference towards lower levels. If a character has nothing to do, no way to grow, then they won't have any reason to do anything, and might as well not exist at all. Give your character a reason to adventure. Give them weakness. Give them a speicalty, a combat style, but keep let's all experience their ascent to a hero of the realm together, instead of in a lore-dump. In short, if your character is exceptionally strong, or has particularly potent powers, they may not be appropriate for the room. They should be challenged by adventures, not treating them as a chance to show off.</p>
  
  <p>On the notion of attunement, an outsider could become attuned, but would require a long-standing devotion to one of the dieties, and such a commitment would come with an expectation of more permenant residence, so as to act on behalf of their diety. It would require convincing an appropriate cleric or acolyte to perform the rites, and they may be quite stringent on what it will take for devotion to be proven.</p>
  
  <h2>What is the general disposition towards outsiders?</h2>
  
  <p>Outsider characters aren't generally known to be outsiders right away, as not everyone carries a holy symbol openly, or even speaks about it. If someone is discovered to be an outsider, dispositions will vary. Some might be more hostile and prejudiced, while others might not care at all, just as it could be with learning that a character was of any specific attunement.</p>
  
  <h2>Does my character HAVE to be attuned if they were born in Aetheria?</h2>
  
  <p>Attunement is a rite all civil folk undergo. It's common for outlaws, bandits, raiders, people who grow up outside of civil society to not be attuned, which in turn makes them typically non-magical, aside from those specifically seeking such power. To refuse attunement is to accept being outcast from society; even if someone does wish to live among the wilds, or away from cities, most will still choose to be attuned before departing to live on their own. In short, it should be exceptionally uncommon, and any character who is discovered to be this way that was born an Aetherian would likely be considered an outlaw.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can my character start as part of a guild/House?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Yes, but only as an initiate or guildmage at most. It also may be more interesting to start outside the guild, and make joining part of their story that we all can enjoy. More info on guilds <a href="guilds.html">[here]</a></p>
  
    
  
    <h2>
    Can I play one of the gods? Or just any god? Or some super important character in established lore?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Gods: No. The seven god(dess)s are played by the master profile. They have very specific nuance to their character, and what they choose to do and when to interfere is very much something that must remain tightly controlled. Their general unavailability most of the time is due to their godly status. While many people may meet their own god, plenty others have never. Other characters in lore, however, may be permitted to be written by other characters, but only once it's clear the writer has a firm grasp on the lore and can play the specific character appropriately without derailing the story.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Is there an overarching story?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Very much so. It will be told through many different adventures, though not all adventures will necessarily be part of the main story. Sometimes you just want to kill an evil wizard to say you've done that.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I play an evil character?
  </h2>
  
  <p>It would be preferrable not to, though there is no hard 'no' to be found here. Just be respectful of other characters if you choose to go down this path.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I fight with other characters? Is there a standard combat system?
  </h2>
  
  <p>The combat system preferred is most in line with <a href="https://theunofficialofficialrulesofroleplay.weebly.com/terminology-t1-t2-t3.html">[T1 style]</a> outlined on that link, which is what most people are used to. Each character takes a turn in the round, and gets to do whatever is reasonable in what would be considered a reasonable time frame for an action, usually restricted to one (ish) attack per post. However, keep in mind that this is not intended to be restrictive, and more of a guideline. Killing other characters is very highly discouraged, and should only be done with explicit permission from the writer. Fighting to the point one party goes unconscious or retreats and is declared the loser is more in line with what player vs. player interactions should look like. Death is very much a reality in the world, however, but for the sake of keeping things respectful and civil between all players, deadly scenarios should always be either as part of an adventure, or with clear understanding from all participants that death is a potential outcome. In the event of any uncertainty, err on the side of non-lethal outcomes, and respect the other writers.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Aetheria is a big world. How do we know where everyone else is?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Reading posts would be the best way, but it also makes sense to put where your character is generally in your status.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Why don't the gods just fix all the problems people have if they live among them?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Gods are powerful beings, but their position of power comes with a responsibility. An invading army of evil, otherworldly beings would certainly be met with godly wrath. But the local raiders pillaging a city? There are more important things on a god's radar. Most of the time, the gods are nowhere to be found. Special events may see one or more of them arriving at a certain place, or they may be found at random, but despite living among the people they aren't all that much easier to contact than a regular god outside of, as mentioned, random chance or specific events where their presence is pre-planned.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I use my Aetheria character outside of Aetheria?
  </h2>
  
  <p>By all means, though understand that, first, to escape Aetheria into other planes would require some IC reason, as extraplanar travel going in and out of Aetheria is not as simple as it is for other realms, which is important for plot. Second, to leave and have your character suddenly gain access to all manner of powers that can be taken back into Aetheria would be considered RPing in bad faith in terms of RP participation.</p>
  
    <h2>
    What is a reasonable pool of starting resources for a character?
  </h2>
  
  <p>This should be taken generally as a 'be sensible' approach, but to be more specific, an adventurer ought to be expected to start their adventuring career with around 100gp, an appropriate set of inexpensive armor, one to three mundane weapons of average craftsmanship, some adventuring gear including a bedroll, backpack, torch or lantern, tent, mess kit, flint, and a standard 50ft rope coil. It's not mandatory to track resources, but you are welcome to so that challenges that are presented don't involve your character farting out the exact piece of adventuring gear they might need solve a problem. </p>
  
    <h2>
    The politics section makes it seem like lots of people hate each other, is it expected that all people (and characters) would feel so strongly?
  </h2>
  
  <p>No, there are general feelings that one nation's people might have towards another, but they are guidelines at best that are intended to help you understand how many NPCs might feel about your character when entering other lands. Every NPC and character is a free-thinking person, and there certainly exist friendships and even romances and marriages between controversial pairings, like a Lightsworn and Shadowsworn, or Firesworn and Tidesworn. Some people feel strongly, others don't care at all; some hate everyone, others accept everyone. Moreover, while descriptions embody many traits that might be common in any nation, they are also by no means hard rules. A Firesworn need not care for battle; a Skysworn may be born with two left feet; a Shadowsworn may be loud and obnoxious and be terrible at keeping secrets. Going against the grain has social consequences, but may result in more broad acceptance in other nations.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Is there a big bad evil guy?
  </h2>
  
  <p>There will be many antagonists that will come up as the story progresses. Depending on how active things get, there may be time enough for multiple arcs which showcase the rise and fall of heroes and villains alike, with the world changing appropriately.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Can I play a villain?
  </h2>
  
  <p>The likely answer to this is no; it may be permissible in time to have others run specific stories, but at least at the outset it is assumed most will be growing more comfortable with the lore of the world before they would be able to take on such a task.</p>
  
    <h2>
    What is there to do? Can we only participate when the room owner is around?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Not at all! RP is free as it would be in any room. Be respectful of other people posting, do not overflow with OOC chatter. The room admin will run events, but the goal is for everyone to do as they would do in any fantasy room, with additional events happening regularly.</p>
  
    <h2>
    Is smut allowed?
  </h2>
  
  <p>Yes, sexual themes are entirely permissible. Please keep anything generally accepted as unpleasant for most to read (gore, vore, watersports, etc) in private. And while the room has strong adventuring themes, making a common character who is just there for a fantasy slice-of-life that may or may not involve smut is also perfectly acceptable.</p>
  
  <h2>Can I invite others into this?</h2>
  
  <p>By all means! It is open to all, and hopefully this FAQ answers most questions.</p>
  
  <h2>Who are the mods?</h2>
