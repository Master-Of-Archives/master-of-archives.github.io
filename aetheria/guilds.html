<h2>
  Guilds
  </h2>
  
  
 <p> Within Aetheria, there are many guilds. The most prominent guilds, ones whose influence becomes a major impact to the world at large, are known as Houses. To become a House, a guild must collect a large number of members, with the exact number being at the discretion of the God Dragons of Aetheria, as they typically have final say as to whether a guild becomes a House. Every guild, regardless of size, follows the same ranking system as has been tradition for countless years. It helps identify members of significance and gives order and hierarchy to the guilds. The only collection of individuals under a single banner that does not follow this ranking tradition is the Shining Star Order, as they use military ranks, given that they are a primarily military and peacekeeping group.</p>
 
  <h3>Initiate</h3>
 
<p>The basic rank for members who join. They are typically admitted in a state of probation. Those who show disloyalty to the guild at this rank are often cast out and barred from ever being inducted into its ranks again. A group of initiates, typically two to four, often answer to a single Guildmage to seek orders or guidance. This mentorship allows initiates to learn the rules of the guild and acclimate to the way of life while working to become a proper guildmage.</p>
 
  <h3>Guildmage</h3>
 
<p>The most common and numerous rank of any guild, a guildmage is merely a member who has been granted full admittance to the guild. They gain no special rights, but are no longer under probation and have more leeway in answering for any actions. Initiates often advance to Guildmage rather quickly once they have learned the basics of the guild, and are entrusted to act independently. Guildmages who show promise are taken under the mentorship of a Master Guildmage.</p>
 
  <h3>Master Guildmage</h3>
 
<p>A Master Guildmage is a Guildmage who has been either appointed to this rank by a Keyrune Holder or higher rank, or has been taken under the mentorship of a Master Guildmage who will educate and train them to become stronger and take on the goals of the guild more personally; when a Master Guildmage believes their apprentice is worthy of being appointed to a Master Guildmage, they make a case on behalf of the Guildmage to a Keyrune Holder. Upon approval, the Guildmage is advanced to Master Guildmage. Master Guildmages often have special access to libraries, weapons, equipment and other resources not available to lower ranks. They become eligible to become Keyrune Holders at this rank, and often have say in the affairs of greater decisions within the guild.</p>
 
  <h3>Keyrune Holder</h3>
 
<p>A Keyrune Holder is a Master Guildmage who has been chosen specifically by a Signet Mage to be given a Keyrune. Keyrunes are powerful magical artefacts, and so only Houses have the resources to manufacture them. A Keyrune is a staff with the symbol of the guild shaped or engraved upon it, and imbued with potent magic that allows it to act as a key to access sealed areas of guild halls. Moreover, they often have charges that allow for casting of spells through them, even if the bearer of the Keyrune is not the most magically adept; it is universal that a Keyrune acts as a catalyst to teleport the bearer back to the guild hall from anywhere in Aetheria. Keyrune holders are considered the height of rank for most guilds, and have significant say in what happens within the guild. They often act as shining examples of everything lower guild members should strive to be. Keyrune Holders are considered by the other Signet Mages and the leader of the House to advance to a Signet Mage.</p>
 
  <h3>Signet Mage</h3>
 
<p>A Signet Mage is chosen by other Signet Mages and the leader, or Parun, of the House. Signet Mages have a powerful magical signet that they wear that further increases their magical abilities, as well as acts as a symbol of status that would drive away most any combatant to run with their tail between their legs. Only the most accomplished guildmages achieve this rank, and must demonstrate an unfaltering loyalty to the guild, as well as strong leadership skills among other things considered by the House. To see a Signet Mage standing before you as an enemy is a death sentence, but there can be no more than ten Signet Mages per House. There is often only two to six, however, as it is a responsibility and place of status that few are capable of achieving.</p>
 
  <h3>Parun</h3>
 
<p>The leader of a House, the Parun acts until their final days. Upon being inducted, they keep a written will ciphered with magic that dictates their successor, chosen only among Signet Mages of the House. In the event they fall in battle or otherwise perish, the will is deciphered and the named Signet Mage is appointed as Parun. A Parun has no specific boons they receive, but by the point someone is capable of becoming Parun, they are already nearing the peak of magical and/or physical power possible for their mortal forms. That said, they often participate very little in combat, and their lives often become more introverted with the internal affairs of the House, dictating its future thereafter.</p>
