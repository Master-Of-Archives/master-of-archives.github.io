  <h2>
    The Land of Dragons
  </h2>
  <p>Aetheria. The land of dragons. A land of magic. Whether born in its world or arriving from some other place, one will soon understand two things. The first: Dragons thrive. Though still somewhat uncommon to see, dragons have found co-existence with humans in this world. Metallic dragons of brass and silver and copper and beyond trend towards lawful and good, whereas more typically evil chromatic dragons as found in other worlds, like white and red and green dragons, trend towards good as well, though perhaps more chaotic than lawful. This doesn't mean evil dragons do not exist, of course. They remain a bane upon the world, and can even use the world's trust in dragons to hide in plain sight until they are ready to inflict their harm. But beyond the regular class of dragons, there is something greater: Gods. The gods of Aetheria, of which there are seven, live among the people, and are all true dragons by birth, though they may shift their form to humanoid figures to more closely interact with their followers.</p>
  
  <p>The second: Magic is everywhere. The magical force which suffuses the air, the dirt, the trees, the realm entirely is known as the 'Aether', though many magical scholars also use this interchangibly with the more recognizable term: the 'Weave'. The Aether is strong enough that, combined with the blessing every Aetherian-born person receives known as 'attunement', even common folk may know how to use low-level magic. Simple things; a spell to call down something from a high shelf, a spell to clean their clothes, to conjure a morsel of food or water, light a fire, or other simple tasks might be within the reach of more dedicated and intelligent commoners. </p>
