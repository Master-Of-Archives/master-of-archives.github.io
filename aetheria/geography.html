<h2>
  Geography
  </h2>
  
  <p>The world of Aetheria is large, but its magical affinity lends well to getting around. Those with coin to spare can ride by coach, pay to ride mounted on a hippogriff that is trained to ferry people from one place to another, then return, or with a greater sum of money can pay to use a teleportation circle to move instantly from one place to another. But for those who don't wish to spend the coin? Roads and their own two feet remain the staple way to get around.</p>
  
  <p>Aetheria is split into seven nations. In the direct north is the Firesworn lands. East are the Shadowsworn lands. South-East are the Thundersworn lands, which share a border with the Shadowsworn and Earthsworn lands. Stretching from the far South-East to the far South-West is the Earthsworn lands. Due West is the Tidesworn lands, which share a border with the Skysworn lands which are directly North of the Tidesworn, sitting around West-North-West. And directly in the centre of Aetherian continent are the Lightsworn lands. Rivers, springs, mountain ranges and water sources irrigate through the land, but the only access to ocean waters is the extreme Western side of the continent; the extreme North beyond the Firesworn lands house the Mountains of Draconis, a stretch of perilous, craggy mountains from which nobody has returned after exploring. In the extreme East, beyond the Shadowsworn lands, are the Cursed Lands - an expanse of twisted and terrifying lands that house twisted and untamed wild magic that spell swift demise for any who travel beyond it. In the extreme South is the Infinite Forest. Many well-oriented wanderers have tried to pass through the Infinite Forest, only to spend a day's travel proceeding through its perils, find a place to shelter, and wake the next morning at the border of the forest again. And indeed, off the far East is the Endless Ocean. Many a ship has set sail out into the Endless Ocean, only to either be consumed by the rolling tides, or to turn back after a week at sea and arrive back at port within the day, suggesting their sailing into the horizon had all been an illusion. It has long been understood that whatever force keeps Aetheria locked up from the multiverse does so within their own world as well, even if the multiverse lockdown has more recently began to break apart, leading to the influx of outsiders.</p>
  
  <h2>Cities / Towns</h2>
  
  <h2>Lightsworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Deningrad</h3>
  
  <p>The capital city, Deningrad, is home to the Crystal Palace - a beautiful work of archetecture that saw an entire castle blessed with light mana until beautiful crystals form on all the walls, encasing them. Of course, the floors are still normal and walkable, but the way the Crystal Palace shines is breathtaking. Deningrad also houses the Respelendent Halls - the headquarters of the Shining Star Order - as well as the guild house for the House of Sunless Skies, as well as the Monument of Light. Truly, it is the central hub of all the Lightsworn have to offer, and while surrounding settlements can be warm, welcoming, bright, and beautiful, there truly is no comparison, as Deningrad is often considered the most beautiful city in all of Aetheria. The High Council - the parlimentary leaders of the Lightsworn - convene in the Crystal Palace to discuss the affairs of the land.</p>
  
  <h2>Firesworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Fyrn</h3>
  
  <p>Fyrn (pronounced Fe-yearn) is a sweltering city. If it was not bad enough that the flame mana within this city is strong from the presence of the Firesworn Lord, it only gets worse given that it also is home to the House of Champions guild hall, as well as the Firesworn Colosseum, which is a place that Vythus himself likes to visit from time to time to observe the battles which take place. And if that wasn't enough? A handful of kilometers away to the east is Volcano Villude, an active volcano which has been repurposed by a group known as the Brothers of the Forge to use it as, well, a forge. The side of the mountain is carved out, and magical crystals were lowered into the magma chamber which transmit the mana generated from the heat of the magma to receptor crystals that the Brothers of the Forge use to forge their weapons. Placed somewhat close to the border, the capital city is the Firesworn's way of challenging any nation that would like to go to war with them, placing all of their strongest fighters at the frontline. </p>
  
  <h2>Skysworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Zephyr</h3>
  
  <p>Home to Castle Vyra, Zephyr is a masterful display of the stoneworking capabilities of the Skysworn. Some buildings tower some ten stories tall, yet have firm foundations enough to resist even the most torrential storms. Walls enclose the entire capital city, with gates out posted at the cardinal directions. The most used gate is the eastern gate, as it leads to the trails which branch out to head to the Firesworn and Tidesworn lands. It features some of the Skysworn's most talented people, and is a common place for Avira to play light-hearted pranks on her followers. The Royal Sky Rose gardens are here, where most of this delicate flower are grown.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Earthsworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Glimmer</h3>
  
  <p>Glimmer is the home of the Earth Mother, Eria, and her clan of elves. Most Earthsworn settlements reject the titles of 'city' or 'town', worrying instead on the people in them instead of classifying them. Glimmer is home to a large number of people who all commune together, some at the forest floor, others in huts and homes constructed up in the trees, with plenty of ropes and bridges set up to enable moving around between them. Glimmer is also home to the Font of Earth, a hotspring that is sacred to the Earthsworn people, as it is said soaking in it will infuse earthy mana into the one bathing, strengthening an Earthsworn's connetion with the earth itself, along with having potent healing properties - enough to restore lost limbs and cure many common ailments. </p>
  
  <h2>Tidesworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Ulara</h3>
  
  <p>Ulara is a lush and beautiful city, rife with magical abundance. It sports towers all along its walls, each with a teleportation circle powered by mana batteries set under the floor so that wizards are able to teleport from one tower to any other tower at will, assuming there is unoccupied space on the circle. It also connects to a teleportation network that spreads through the city, allowing a wizard to read at Ulara's grand Library of Ages one moment, step onto a circle, and teleport instantly to any other circle in the city. Some circles have magical ciphers on the sigil sequences, making them only accessible to selected persons who have business using them. By and large, Ulara is a city of learning, rife with some of Aetheria's most esoteric knowledge, and is populated largely by arcane scholars and wizardly folk. It is often described as a school one never graduates from, and indeed was selected as the capital only because Ravith said so, and decided it was where he wanted to be most of the time.</p>
  
  <h3>Furni</h3>
  
  <p>Furni, the city of water, is a city that is set on a partially submerged wetland. Magic is used to keep buildings afloat, but those entering the city generally do so by boat. Some buildings are able to affix into the ground with wooden foundations, but even then great care had gone into magical reinforcement and securement to the uneasy foundations. That it has stood for more than a few generations speaks to the attention to detail taken to all the matters of the town's construction. </p>
  
  <h3>Donau</h3>
  
  <p>Donau, the city of flowers, is a garden of a city. Planterboxes line the roads, and everyone who lives in this place tends to them. It is a beautiful place to live, so long as one doesn't mind contributing to the botany, whether that be fetching freshwater from the river that runs nearby, planding the seeds and flowers, or selectively breeding the flowers, or whatever is required. On top of mundane sorts, this place also seeks to create more magical, special sorts of flowers. Magical flowers. All manner of things that ought to belong in an alchemist's lab that come out of the earth.  </p>
  
  <h3>Mallow Hill</h3>
  
  <p>A small settlement just outside of the guild hall of the House of Runes. A place inhabited almost exclusively by spellcasters, though besides an inn, a magical items and general goods store, and a tavern that is used more as a reading place than a place to get drunk, there's not much to see in this small settlement. Indeed, it's mostly used for those who do not wish to live in the guild hall, or perhaps are just visiting for a time, along with housing for those who act in a more clerical capacity for the House of Runes.</p>
  
  <h2>Thundersworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Lohan</h3>
  
  <p>Lohan is a city of commerce. If there is something to be sold, it can be found in Lohan. The fierce competition between vendors leads to very agreeable prices for items that are in high demand, and absolutely absurd prices for things that are one of a kind - of which there aren't many. The city is densely packed, with multi-level buildings being a store on the ground floor, but also having a completely different store on the floor above, accessed by either an internal staircase or a wooden bridge that is affixed to a string of buildings row-on-row and allows people to walk overhead to bypass the foot traffic of the crowded ground level. Lohan also has a stadium for combat and/or performances. Duels are a common sight in Lohan's stadium, with people looking to prove themselves against one another in no short supply.</p>
  
  <h2>Shadowsworn</h2>
  
  <h3>Capital City: Seles</h3>
  
  <p>Seles is a quiet place. It is the capital of the Shadowsworn lands, and where the Silver Eye Collective has its headquarters. It has everything one might need to live comfortably - as much as one can be in the Shadowsworn lands. It also sports many underground silent markets. The people of Seles are generally friendly and accomodating. The SSO patrols the area more than any other place, as it has places for people to take shelter for the night if they are caught out at night hours. As far as Shadowsworn lands go, it is about as noisy as things get, which doesn't mean much; its noise rarely rises above a dull rumble. One can easily hear the drop of a pin if there are few others nearby. It has infrastructure to allow teleportation to other notable locations in the Shadowsworn lands - teleportation is preferred for all Shadowsworn, as one cannot hope to travel some distances in a single night, and risking being outside at night is to risk death. Therefore, many of the teleportation circles between cities are provided free access to the public, as the Shadowsworn care more for the safety of its residents and visitors than they care for gold.</p>
  
  <h3>Neet</h3>
  
  <p>Neet is a city of death. It houses the crematorium that most Shadowsworn have as their final destination where their body is exsanguinated, then cremated, with the blood then transported back to Seles for archival. Because of this practice, Neet very regularly has plumes of ash that spew from its crematorium and rise high into the air, usually depositing around the town. Because of this, it looks often like the city is covered in snow, whereas the soft layer underfoot is the ashes of the dead. Shadowsworn consider blood more true to a person's self than their body or ashes. It is thought to be a more direct connection to the soul, though the body is respected as well. The citizens of Neet are not very talkative; their responsibilities are usually handed down through generations, and their work is important. It's said that they feel more comfortable in the company of the ashes of the dead than among the living.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <h2>Notable Landmarks</h2>
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/78NLNjW.jpg" style="float: right; width: 30%; height: auto; margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 2vh;">
  <h3>The Elemental Monuments</h3>
    
    <p>There exist five elemental monuments in Aetheria. The Monument of Light, located in Deningrad, capital city of the Lightsworn lands. The Monument of Flames, located in the central northern Firesworn lands, slightly west of the guild hall of the House of Dragoons. The Monument of Tides, located on the border between Tidesworn and Skysworn lands, a few kilometers west of the central median of the two lands. The Monument of Earth, located central south in the Earthsworn lands, a few days' walk south from the guild hall of House Gaia. And the Monument of Shadows, located in the central north-eastern area of the Shadowsworn lands. Each of these monuments makes the air around them resonate with mana of their elemental nature. Each of them is massive, standing a few hundred meters tall. Many visit the monuments to pray to their god(dess), though there's nothing specifically sacred about them to the dieties of Aetheria. They are, however, a prominent source of worldly mana, and thought to be at least part of the reason that magic resonates so strongly in Aetheria.
