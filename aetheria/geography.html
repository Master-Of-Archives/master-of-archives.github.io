<h2>
  Geography
  </h2>
  
  <p>The world of Aetheria is large, but its magical affinity lends well to getting around. Those with coin to spare can ride by coach, pay to ride mounted on a hippogriff that is trained to ferry people from one place to another, then return, or with a greater sum of money can pay to use a teleportation circle to move instantly from one place to another. But for those who don't wish to spend the coin? Roads and their own two feet remain the staple way to get around.</p>
  
  <p>Aetheria is split into seven nations. In the direct north is the Firesworn lands. East are the Shadowsworn lands. South-East are the Thundersworn lands, which share a border with the Shadowsworn and Earthsworn lands. Stretching from the far South-East to the far South-West is the Earthsworn lands. Due West is the Tidesworn lands, which share a border with the Skysworn lands which are directly North of the Tidesworn, sitting around West-North-West. And directly in the centre of Aetherian continent are the Lightsworn lands. Rivers, springs, mountain ranges and water sources irrigate through the land, but the only access to ocean waters is the extreme Western side of the continent; the extreme North beyond the Firesworn lands house the Mountains of Draconis, a stretch of perilous, craggy mountains from which nobody has returned after exploring. In the extreme East, beyond the Shadowsworn lands, are the Cursed Lands - an expanse of twisted and terrifying lands that house twisted and untamed wild magic that spell swift demise for any who travel beyond it. In the extreme South is the Infinite Forest. Many well-oriented wanderers have tried to pass through the Infinite Forest, only to spend a day's travel proceeding through its perils, find a place to shelter, and wake the next morning at the border of the forest again. And indeed, off the far East is the Endless Ocean. Many a ship has set sail out into the Endless Ocean, only to either be consumed by the rolling tides, or to turn back after a week at sea and arrive back at port within the day, suggesting their sailing into the horizon had all been an illusion. It has long been understood that whatever force keeps Aetheria locked up from the multiverse does so within their own world as well, even if the multiverse lockdown has more recently began to break apart, leading to the influx of outsiders.</p>

  <h3>The Elemental Monuments</h3>
    
    <p>There exist five elemental monuments in Aetheria. The Monument of Light, located in Deningrad, capital city of the Lightsworn lands. The Monument of Flames, located in the central northern Firesworn lands, slightly west of the guild hall of the House of Dragoons. The Monument of Tides, located on the border between Tidesworn and Skysworn lands, a few kilometers west of the central median of the two lands. The Monument of Earth, located central south in the Earthsworn lands, a few days' walk south from the guild hall of House Gaia. And the Monument of Shadows, located in the central north-eastern area of the Shadowsworn lands. Each of these monuments makes the air around them resonate with mana of their elemental nature. Each of them is massive, standing a few hundred meters tall. Many visit the monuments to pray to their god(dess), though there's nothing specifically sacred about them to the dieties of Aetheria. They are, however, a prominent source of worldly mana, and thought to be at least part of the reason that magic resonates so strongly in Aetheria.
