<h2>
  A Duel for Honour
  </h2>
  
  <h3>Aetheria</h3>
<p>It was a day not unlike many others in the Firesworn capital of Fyrn. There was some celebration going on in the Skysworn capital, and Lord Cerberus really didn't like the idea of loyal subjects being so bored with their daily lives that they thought that the best way to spend their day. So, well in advance, notice was put up of some public events to be held coincidentally on the same day. Two Firesworn men were at odds, clashing with one another over a legal dispute, and the situation had escalated to the matter of a duel. So it was, the date was set, of course by sheer coincidence, on the same day, for them to fight. Unlike most matters like this, the two men had agreed to a fight to the death. Truly, the legal matter, as described on the posted papers, was actually more of a personal one, all concerning the fidelity of a woman. One party - an elven Firesworn man named Haisen Wintersun - was the long-standing lover of the elven Firesworn woman, Iryth Gemblossom. </p>
  
  <p>A human Firesworn man by the name of Morin Swifthammer declared his affections for Iryth and asked the woman for their hand in marriage. Haisen of course declared this an affront to his honour, made all the worse when Morin declared that he and Iryth had already bedded together. The rumours which circulated said that the two men nearly broke into a fight to the death in that very moment, but in abiding by the laws of the Firesworn did Morin declare he would not do so until his case was heard by the courts. When questioned, Iryth denied any involvement with Morin. Rumours still circulated to create doubt, however - first-hand accounts that swear on oath that they had seen Morin and Iryth together, hand in hand. 
    
    <p>The case was heard by the Lord, and it was his decision that a fight over a woman like this could be proven only in battle - the man who loved Iryth most could only be decided by who was willing to die for them. With neither party satisfied - Haisen's honour impugned and Morin's professed love unrequited - the two were told the only option was a duel. Lord Cerberus may have...Heavily suggested that it be appropriate to the death, but it was indeed entirely left up to the men, who did agree. Morin did declare that once he had slain Haisen, he would in doing so free Iryth of the shame of infidelity, declaring in what further impugned Haisen's honour that he had her scared to speak the truth under threat of death, so was declared to him in their bed chambers on many nights. Morin's ears were deaf to Iryth's pleas to end this, so the rumours go, as the man was certain he was in the right. So it was, a day like any other day, the matters of honour between two Firesworn men were to be settled in the Colosseum of Fyrn. The mid-afternoon sun hung in the sky, and the time was fast approaching to see the spectacle unfold.</p>
  
  <h3>Naleana Ruby</h3>
  <p>Naleana had certainly heard of the ongoing event. It wasn't unusual, but uncommon enough that it warranted a visit. If for no other reason than to see a fight, she wandered around Fyrn until the time had come to enter the Colosseum. She marveled up at the structure; no matter how many times she saw it, it was magnificent. A masterwork of stone with metal accents, and fiery mana flowing from it, courtesy of the inlaid crystals placed into the stonework and affixed by metal settings. Just getting close to it, her soul was alight with energy. The tingle of mana in the air always made for an exciting atmosphere. The matter was of the public courts, so there was no charge to enter. Once she did enter, she made her way up to the stands, and found a seat for herself not particularly far from the growing crowds, but enough that she wouldn't be shoulder to shoulder with strangers. Of course, like many others present, she was armed. Her halberd was over her back, affixed to her by a leather strap. Now, all there was to do was watch.</p>

  
  <h3>Amadeus Redgale</h3>
<p>A day not unlike many others in Fyrn naturally meant an overwhelming amount of heat for any outsider. Even as his group approached the city, he could feel the growing warmth promising him an unforgettable first impression in the ways of stains on white clothing. Yet, as much as he would've liked to fashion himself as tge first person to do so, it was unlikely he was even the hundredth Skysworn to manifest a faint, cool breeze to refresh him every so often. But it'd be a shame to visit Fyrn and not do as the Firesworns, so when he was offered a spot in the caravan again in their next stop further into the Firesworn territory he respectfully declined and went on his merryway. Not before buying some apples from his fellow Skysworn travelers, of course.</p>
  
  <p>Sadly, he was missing the celebrations in Zephyr because of his own lacking attention and by the time he returned home they'd be on their final legs so he had to entertain himself in some other way. And that'd come in the crowd gathering in the Colosseum for the duel to death over this romantic strife. Amadeus had heard of how important matters of honor were to this people, but a duel to the death felt rather excessive to him. Nevertheless, he'd keep his thoughts to himself. He was a foreigner after all. So he'd settle himself with going to the Colosseum as fast as he could to get a seat that was both as far away in the front as he could guarantee, and somewhat isolated as to not bother strangers with his arcane air conditioning. After all, he didn't want to be in the sands because of third-grade cooling.</p>
