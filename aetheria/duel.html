<h2>
  A Duel for Honour
  </h2>
  
  <h3>Aetheria</h3>
<p>It was a day not unlike many others in the Firesworn capital of Fyrn. There was some celebration going on in the Skysworn capital, and Lord Cerberus really didn't like the idea of loyal subjects being so bored with their daily lives that they thought that the best way to spend their day. So, well in advance, notice was put up of some public events to be held coincidentally on the same day. Two Firesworn men were at odds, clashing with one another over a legal dispute, and the situation had escalated to the matter of a duel. So it was, the date was set, of course by sheer coincidence, on the same day, for them to fight. Unlike most matters like this, the two men had agreed to a fight to the death. Truly, the legal matter, as described on the posted papers, was actually more of a personal one, all concerning the fidelity of a woman. One party - an elven Firesworn man named Haisen Wintersun - was the long-standing lover of the elven Firesworn woman, Iryth Gemblossom. </p>
  
  <p>A human Firesworn man by the name of Morin Swifthammer declared his affections for Iryth and asked the woman for their hand in marriage. Haisen of course declared this an affront to his honour, made all the worse when Morin declared that he and Iryth had already bedded together. The rumours which circulated said that the two men nearly broke into a fight to the death in that very moment, but in abiding by the laws of the Firesworn did Morin declare he would not do so until his case was heard by the courts. When questioned, Iryth denied any involvement with Morin. Rumours still circulated to create doubt, however - first-hand accounts that swear on oath that they had seen Morin and Iryth together, hand in hand. 
    
    <p>The case was heard by the Lord, and it was his decision that a fight over a woman like this could be proven only in battle - the man who loved Iryth most could only be decided by who was willing to die for them. With neither party satisfied - Haisen's honour impugned and Morin's professed love unrequited - the two were told the only option was a duel. Lord Cerberus may have...Heavily suggested that it be appropriate to the death, but it was indeed entirely left up to the men, who did agree. Morin did declare that once he had slain Haisen, he would in doing so free Iryth of the shame of infidelity, declaring in what further impugned Haisen's honour that he had her scared to speak the truth under threat of death, so was declared to him in their bed chambers on many nights. Morin's ears were deaf to Iryth's pleas to end this, so the rumours go, as the man was certain he was in the right. So it was, a day like any other day, the matters of honour between two Firesworn men were to be settled in the Colosseum of Fyrn. The mid-afternoon sun hung in the sky, and the time was fast approaching to see the spectacle unfold.</p>
