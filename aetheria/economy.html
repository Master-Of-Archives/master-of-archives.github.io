 Economy
  </h2>
    <p>Everyone needs money. It buys shelter, it buys food, it pays for labour, for repairs, and for a new sword when an Ankheg snaps your pretty longsword your father left you in two. Below, you'll find information on what expectations to have with money and how to play it most in line with other characters.</p>
  
  <h2>Coins</h2>
  
  <p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>
  
<p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p>
  
<p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</p>
  
<p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from forgotten times, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions, though it is not entirely uncommon for platinum coins to be used for high-value transactions where the desire is indeed to exchange coins instead of goods of equal value. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p>
  
  <p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p>
  
  <p>Using gold pieces, the following is the exchange rate:</p>
  
  10 Copper Pieces (CP) = 1 Silver Piece (SP)<br>
  100 Copper Pieces (CP) = 1 Gold Piece (GP)<br>
  10 Silver Pieces (SP) = 1 Gold Piece (GP)<br>
  2 Electrum Pieces (EP) = 1 Gold Piece (GP) [EP are Uncommon coins]<br>
  1 Platinum Piece (PP) = 10 Gold Pieces (GP) [Usually, PP is only for the very wealthy]<br>
