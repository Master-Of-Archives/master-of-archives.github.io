<h2>
 Economy
  </h2>
    <p>Everyone needs money. It buys shelter, it buys food, it pays for labour, for repairs, and for a new sword when an Ankheg snaps your pretty longsword your father left you in two. Below, you'll find information on what expectations to have with money and how to play it most in line with other characters.</p>
  
  <h2>Coins</h2>
  
  <p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>
  
<p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p>
  
<p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</p>
  
<p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from forgotten times, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions, though it is not entirely uncommon for platinum coins to be used for high-value transactions where the desire is indeed to exchange coins instead of goods of equal value. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p>
  
  <p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p>
  
  <p>Using gold pieces, the following is the exchange rate:</p>
  
  10 Copper Pieces (CP) = 1 Silver Piece (SP)<br>
  100 Copper Pieces (CP) = 1 Gold Piece (GP)<br>
  10 Silver Pieces (SP) = 1 Gold Piece (GP)<br>
  2 Electrum Pieces (EP) = 1 Gold Piece (GP) [EP are Uncommon coins]<br>
  1 Platinum Piece (PP) = 10 Gold Pieces (GP) [Usually, PP is only for the very wealthy]<br>
  
  
  <h2>
    Cost of Living & Buying Magic Items
  </h2>
  
  <p>The cost of living depends largely on how one chooses to live. It's assumed that all characters in their time not spent actively adventuring are maintaining their lifestyles. What this means is that, in general, characters are expected to remain more or less stagnant outside of active RP. They may encounter good times and hard times financially; if they are a skilled labourer who owns a small business - a smith, for example - in their downtime, they might have an influx of business that keeps them busy and keeps their pockets full, but might also have an unexpected expense in the way of some broken equipment or the wrath of nature enacting justice on their signage. Because of this, if you choose to track resources such as coin, it is understood that outside of active RP a character's resources will remain static.</p>
  
  <p>If your character has a vocation beyond adventuring - a smith, tanner, performer, artisan, etc - then it's assumed this is used to support themselves. While it might realistically contribute to a steadily growing savings, taking the stance that a character's backstory means they have a good paying job so they can afford anything makes for awfully disappointing resolutions to financial challenges that might arise. At times, part of a story might present an opportunity for adventurers to seek coin to pay for something prohibitatively expensive. The ensuing adventure would itself be far more memorable than the character(s) just conveniently having the coin on hand. If coin is not tracked actively, then it's assumed the players will make sensible decisions about what their characters can afford. Even if a character may provide magical services, which would typically be assumed to pay much better, it's assumed paying customers for it are much harder to find, and therefore ought to make equal their financial status relative to other player characters.</p>
  
  <p>When it comes to spoils of adventure, however, a character can be expected to run into a hefty sum of coin along the way. Adventuring, while dangerous, can be very lucrative. So while a day's worth of food in what would equal a middle-class, comfortable living would sit around five silver pieces, something any player character could easily afford, even small consumable pieces of adventuring gear - like a basic Potion of Heaing - would cost fifty gold pieces, which would be more than two month's pay for a skilled (but not exceptional) artisan, who could expect to earn about one gold piece per day, and would be assumed to take an average amount of days for themselves. The costs for items even remotely enchanted would be valued upwards of a thousand gold pieces, which would equal more than two years of comfortable living.</p>
  
  <p>Items of a highly magical nature, even in a highly magical setting such as Aetheria, are simply not within the reach of common, working-class folk. Common items like a Potion of Healing, mildly enchanted ammunition like a fire arrow, or items enchanted to have mundane effects like a set of clothes that magically resist getting wet or dirty might be within the reach of the average person, but would eat a chunk of their saved wealth to purchase. Items like a cloak of invisibility, which would be valued closer to one hundred thousand gold pieces, are just not possible acquisitions for the average person, or even the average adventurer. Legendary items, like the Holy Avenger wielded by Aurora of the Shining Star Order, would push the limits of value. At minimum, such a thing would cost several hundred thousand gold pieces - so prohibitavely expensive that it might as well not have an associated value at all and instead just be considered priceless.</p>
  
  <p>When talking about any item that could be considered 'rare', even if it has an associated value, whomever is selling it may not be looking for an exchange of coin. More likely, there's some other perilous service an adventurer might provide in trade. Though, it does remain possible that someone who might have gained possession of something particularly valuable is looking to sell it at a hefty mark up, and live off the profits for the rest of their lives. Below is a general expectation of what any given might cost given its rarity:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Common: 50-100 gp</li>
    <li>Uncommon: 101-500 gp</li>
    <li>Rare: 501 -5,000 gp</li>
    <li>Very Rare: 5,001 - 50,000 gp</li>
    <li>Legendary: 50,001+ gp, often priceless</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <p>While the exchange of any goods rare and greater would likely take place as part of greater story, these general rules cannot cover every possible scenario. Use your best discretion, and understand that acquision of power or monetary goods ought to take place in service of creating memorable moments in RP, rather than just to be a power player in an RPG. In following those guidelines, what follows in RP should remain acceptable. If ever unsure, always feel free to ask.</p>
