<h2>
  Current Rumours
  </h2>
  
  <p>A man's lips loosen up a little after he's bought a few rounds of ale. He leans in and whispers to the table of adventurers. He's heard things. A shady man catches the eye of a passing adventurer. Curious, the adventurer follows. The shady man has information to barter if the adventurer is willing to part with a fistful of gold. An adventurer with keen hearing listens in on the table next to them in the local tavern. There's a noble who has been spilling secrets to a pretty face. These are the rumours. These are the whisperings that people hear about the world. These are the things people speak of in taverns, back alleys, secret meetings. Information travels, sometimes with a price. These are some of the things adventurers in Aetheria might hear.</p>
  
  <p>For in-game purposes, these rumours can be things your character hears other NPCs talking about if you'd like to flavour them overhearing something going on in the appropriate areas, denoted under each rumour. Else, they will come up from the master profile. Each rumour will have more to it if investigations are done; typically it will be a quest of some sort, but it's also possible that a rumour might just lead to some strings of interactions that eventually conclude the rumour. When something is concluded here, it will be added to the main story's chronicle with its resolution.</p>
  
  <h3>
    The Skysworn Princess
  </h3>
  <p>Rumour local to: Skysworn</p>
  
  <p>Princess Azura Vyra was once beloved by the people. She was friendly, sociable, sweet, kind, and truly embodied the most positive aspects of Skysworn culture. However, once she turned sixteen, things began to change. She became hostile, bitter, cruel, and all manner of bad things. People were heartbroken over it. To this day, people still are. Azura has since become a recluse within the castle - never appearing to the public again since her eighteenth birthday. Rumours buzz about it, some saying she was possessed, others saying she hated the idea of being royalty so much she just snapped, others still saying that secretly Azura had a twin - the real Azura died, and this was the twin that always wanted to stay inside and never be known having to take on her dead twin sister's life! The validity of any claim has nothing for proof, but the rumours still circulate.</p>
  
  <h3>
    Bandits!
  </h3>
  <p>Rumour local to: Tidesworn, Lightsworn</p>
  
  <p>There's been some troublemakers raiding trade routes between the Lightsworn and Tidesworn lands on a road called the Birch Pass. It is one of the main passages of trade between the Tidesworn and Lightsworn lands, so it sees heavy traffic. The Shining Star has taken to escorting caravans where they can. But the sight of armed soldiers keeps bandits at bay, so it remains a problem for any tradespeople who don't have an escort, and may be willing to pay a budding adventurer to walk along the path.</p>
 
  
  <h3>
    Metal Beasts
  </h3>
  <p>Rumour local to: Skysworn, Lightsworn, Firesworn</p>
  
  <p>Word has been passed around in taverns of adventurers and civilians who were robbed by 'metal beasts'. The rumours suggest they are either as small as a halfling or as big as a hill giant, lending to this rumour likely being little more than people thinking up stories. Still, the fact that it sprung up in different, unconnected places lends credibility to it.</p>
