<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Through Ellesandra's travels they had doubtlessly encountered many faces good and bad; for them to hear the commotion of banditry in progress might be as familiar as the pleasant birdsong of a morning in these forested lands. "Oi! Get back here, girly! We ain't done wit'cha yet!" came the gruff voice of one man, dulled through the trees. Another voice cackled alongside the first. "Kekekeh, what'ssamatter? We ain't gonna hurt'cha, s'long as ya giz all your coin!" Then, a third voice. A womanly yelp. It was close by, but difficult to see through the tree-line. The main road did not have a clear path, so dashing through the underbrush was the most direct route. No other people could be seen along the road as it stretched north-south; the yelp of a woman in peril came from the east. Another voice then echoed. Male, like the other gruff ones: "A-ta-ta-ta, easy, girlie, ain't getting away that easy! We got'cha now, so why dun'ya give up nice and easy. We'll also be takin' that pretty silk dress o' yours, o'course.."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was aimless. She was wandering, following road to town then another road to another town. Usually she picked up a job on the way, but no one in particular was travelling this way so this time, she was alone. Armor plated feet made that particular metallic noise upon each step down the dirt path, her eyes ahead and taking in the sights of the roads. Might as well enjoy the environment on her trip, right? That was, until she heard voices off in the distance, in the trees to the side of the road. Ellesandra came up to a stop, head tilting and listening. The voice of a few men, seeming to be trying to encourage someone to give them coin filtered through the trees. Despite this, Ellesandra didn't start moving, not into the sound of a womanly yelp came out. Ellesandra's left hand moved to rest on the rapier hilt on her right hip, taking a few steps forwards towards the trees and the underbrush. A glance was given down both directions of the road, and the other side of the road behind her; a cursory scan to ensure that this wasn't some ploy to trap her or get her surrounded or distracted. Not that anyone had reason to target her, but it wasn't unheard of for bandits to use the idea of a damsel in distress to trap someone else, too. Confirming that there was no immediate danger behind her, she eyed the right places to step and quickly moved through the underbrush, taking long strides that skipped as much ground as possible with intentionally placed steps to ensure that she didn't step on any traps that may have been left and hidden within the obscured brush. She ignored the pricks of foliage that brushed against her, stepping through into the small clearing that the bandits, and the woman, was. At least three men, and then the apparent damsel. Ellesandra didn't look particularly imposing, height wise. She was short at 5'1, though wearing an ornate looking white breastplate with carvings and designs on it, abnormal for someone to wear if they ever expected to get hit in it. A plate skirt, matched this, going down to mid thigh where it met long, gauntleted boots to protect the remainder of her legs. Black tights were worn beneath, both to cover the skin open to the air and prevent the metal from resting against it directly. Long, white hair was currently hanging down to her mid back, natural waves and curls in it. Typically if she were expecting a fight it would be worn up in a ponytail, though she hadn't been about to stop to put it up before stepping in. Blue eyes stood out from a pale skinned face, quickly taking in the situation. She did not immediately draw her blade, but would take a few steps to circle the situation, steps that would take her closer to the woman, but not quite in-between them yet. "Gentlemen, any chance I can persuade you to depart with your lives?" Words were spoken coldly, and straight to the point, with a stoic face that took years of practice to master. She looked almost bored, as if she didn't truly care about the outcome of this encounter. Her eyes reflected the dead feelings inside of her, but there were so many feelings that weren't being shown. Guilt was overwhelming, one that almost encompassed the rest of them and made them hard to feel. The guilt alone was pressing down the sadness, grief, depression. The only feeling that competed with the guilt was anger, though this was partially directed at herself so the anger and guilt blended together in many aspects. Rising up to the surface, the caution and suspicion at her current predicament, paranoia that this was a trap, and also irritation at these bandits for even making this an issue if it were a real situation. Preying on a lone traveler was weak and cowardly, and the irritation was making itself known.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Checking their surroundings, Ellesandra found nothing but empty road and a midday horizon greeting them in both directions. Unless the stray squirrel they spied on the tree behind them was secretly an evil-doer posing as a woodland critter, there was no trap to be found. Indeed, as they stepped through the underbrush, they came to find the situation exactly as it would be expected as they stepped into a clearing amidst the trees that sported trodden earth and patchy grass. Three bandits, each sporting red bandanas, scruffy beards, and less-than-pristine scimitars that had bitten the wood of ship decks as much as they had their pray. Pirates, it seemed, standing at various heights hovering around six feet, and all looking decently conditioned by their pirate lifestyle. Striped white and red sea-fairing shirts with suspender-bearing pants that were tattered and torn from the life at sea. A nearby port town to the north-east explained their presence here, though that remained a town yet to be visited by the knight. The three of them turned to look at the knightly woman when they arrived. They stood in a triangular formation, surrounding another woman. This woman looked entirely out of place among these ruffians, which was likely what led to this situation in the first place. A bit taller than Ellesandra at five-five. Long, flowing white hair pure as an untrodden snowfall. Bright, vibrant blue eyes that were as if the sky and the sea brought to bear their vastness to express the gentle soul of the woman they belonged to. Almost mesmerizing in their striking beauty, or they might be if not for the distracting red wound on the woman's cheek. A gash, likely from one of the pirate blades. It looks to have clotted, but the red streaks down her cheek were fresh and slowly drying. Further evidence of this wound could be seen on Star's dress. A bright, beautiful white and light-blue garment with exuberant frills and feathery adornments along the rim of its brassiere, with sheer fabric visible below the flowy skirt. A dress fit for a princess, even if Star was anything but. Star, despite being surrounded by these evil-doers, did not look exceptionally fearful. Adrenaline was clearly working through her. But it was not the face of an entirely helpless damsel. Just a woman who, even if they did know how to fight, was still very much in danger. The three pirates turned to the knight, the two that were facing Star turned their backs to her to face Ellesandra. The other was already facing them. "Ey? What's this, little lady? C'mon, now, no need for you t' get mixed up in all 'is, then, is there? Move along, we's just seeing to escortin' this 'ere lass to our, ah, protective custody, yeah?" said the first pirate, wearing a grin that showcased some dreadfully rotten and cavitated teeth. "Yeah," chimed in the second. "We'd uh, 'ate to have ta', you know...Get'cha all mixed up in this 'ere...Perfectly legal and legitimate transaction, eh?" he said, wearing a shit-eating grin for his attempt at deception. Star met eyes with Ellesandra when they observed her; she could see the crushing, overwhelming guilt upon them, as well as the anger boiling just under their calm exterior. Star dare not escalate the situation by striking, but...There was a calm readiness in her eyes. A silent signal that she would follow their lead. Star very obviously also did not have a weapon, so one might wonder just what she might have up her sleeve. If she had sleeves, at least. She did not.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra eyed the men who seemed to have ignored that she was well armored and dressed. She carried herself with a practiced, cautious ease. If these men were smart, they would have recognized that she was no mere traveler who just happened to be armed. She'd seen combat; plenty of it. When Ellesandra's eyes met that of the woman, and saw the blood there and along a gown, the irritation turned quickly into anger. It was too similar, seeing this woman on her knees, injured and surrounded by enemies. Her eyes had widened slightly when she looked at the woman, and saw her previous charge, instead. Not literally, of course, but the similarities were enough that her guilt ridden mind easily made a connection, and it took a moment of blinking her image away to reinstate the reality of their current situation. This woman wasn't her Princess, but it did not matter. She had been injured, and Ellesandra was not going to listen to these men's flimsy explanations. With a glance back at the nearest man, her left hand drew her rapier quickly. Her right raised and a light yellow light poured out of it, quickly covering her own body in an enchantment. There were no words spoken for the magic, though it became obvious why she didn't utilize a shield or anything with her rapier, as her right hand had drawn an invisible sigil in the air as the spell took form. Haste, a low powered one currently as these pirates didn't seem like they needed the full extent of the spell and the stronger it was, the bigger the toll it would take on Ellesandra's body. Just enough of a boost to ensure that as she struck, the pirates wouldn't be able to get to their captive. The captive woman looked plenty ready to fight back herself, but Ellesandra wasn't going to risk her own attack causing them to decide to kill the woman instead. With the speed that seemed supernatural to any normal warrior or bandit, her rapier shot out straight for the first man's throat. Ellesandra didn't hold back the killing blow, but whether or not it struck home the rest of her body was moving - grabbing his shirt and hauling him to the side as she stepped in to stand closer to the woman. Close enough that she could defend her if any of the men decided to step in towards her, but wanting to give her enough space to do whatever she had in mind; Ellesandra knew better than to step in between someone about to cast magic or make their own attack and accidentally ruin it or cause them to injure themselves.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirates shifted their stances when the other's weapon was drawn. A fight was inevitable, it seemed. And it was the arrogance of the outlaws that made them all too ill-prepared for what, or rather who, was about to strike them. The magic gave them pause, striking a mild fear into them. But one pirate saw fit to close the distance to try and stop the spell before Ellesandra could weave it. His reaction too slow, the distance too great, and his lifetime of fighting other unskilled pirates did not prepare him for the lethal precision Ellesandra employed. His sword was high, neck exposed as he charged with a battlecry at the knight. His life ended nigh instantly as Ellesandra's rapier pierced his neck, bulging his eyes as his hands grasped with futility at the wound and choked gurgles served as his final words before his lifeless body was discarded, leaving Ellesandra's rapier dripping with his crimson essence. The other two pirates remained too slow to react as Ellesandra took position near Star. Star, then, took the initiative to secure this fight for her knightly protector; she had been swelling magic within her chest while the conversation went on. Time enough for her to be ready upon a hair trigger to do what she planned. Her plan? She shot up to her feet beside Ellesandra, arms thrusting out to either side. A bright blue aura enveloped her as, in that split second of her shooting up, mana exploded outwards from her in the form of a blinding, brilliant light. As bright as the sun, yet Ellesandra would not find the light painful to their eyes. Instead, it was soft. Soothing. A residual white mist lingered around Star and spread out a handful of meters from her to make a swiftly dissipating fog in the aftermath of the spell; breathing deep within this mist would bring with it an emboldening, restorative sensation within Ellesandra, firmly suggesting Star to be the sort of magic user that focused on support and healing as the empowering mist filled Ellesandra's lungs. And, of course, while it empowered Ellesandra? The two remaining pirates were sent reeling back, free hands clutching palms over their eyes as they screamed in agony and blood poured out between their fingers over their eyes. Further evidence that the effect of the blinding flash was selective, given that to the knight it was little more strenuous than walking out into a sunny afternoon field. Wild, aimless swings of their scimitars found nothing as they tried to fight off the knight they knew was...Somewhere near them, ready to end them. Their blindness might be temporary, but given it was on the order of days it truly seemed Ellesandra would hardly have needed to use any magic at all to fell these fools. Doubly so with an ally like Star, though it stood to reason that it was only thanks to Ellesandra's distraction that Star could produce such magic, else she likely would not have ended up trapped in the first place.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had guessed the woman would be using magic of some kind, but she had not expected a brilliant light to appear out of nowhere. Our of instinct, Ellesandra turned her head away from the light and readjusted her position so that she was partially facing the woman, unsure if the woman was fully on her side or not. Still, the light wasn't actually painful to her eyes - something she didn't realize until a moment later - and instead it seemed...soothing. Energizing, really. Yet when she looked up to the pirates, it had obviously hit them differently, unpleasantly based on them seeming to be blinded. The caution and surprise almost filled her emotions, until it was roughly pushed down. Ellesandra could take time later to process what just happened and ask the woman about it. Right now, she was going to take advantage of the situation given. With the two men blinded and swinging their scimitars wildly, it was easy for Ellesandra to step up into range of them and avoid their aimless swings, her still enhanced speed being used to provide them both with a quick end. She could have kept them alive, but the risk of them doing something like this to someone else was too high. So, each of them received the same treatment the first one did; her blade straight through the center of their throat, pulled slightly to the side to ensure it cut into the artery. A quick kill, both depriving of oxygen and a quick bleed out. Not immediate, but close enough. Ellesandra waved her right hand and the haste spell ended on herself even as she turned to look at the woman, blade still drawn. The lethargy from the spell didn't hit as hard this time, considering the restorative magic that had surrounded her from the mage. Not to mention, even as the haste spell ended she could feel the energy from the mage's spell flowing into her in a way the mage probably hadn't expected; the mana of it itself replacing that which Ellesandra had used for her own spell. Ellesandra flicked the tip of her rapier to the side to get rid of most of the blood on it, eyes still on the apparent 'damsel'. She reached back, slipping her hand into a pocket on her bag and pulling out a dirty cloth rag and cleaning the rest of the blood off of the blade, but not speaking. She wanted to see how the woman responded to the men having been killed; she wasn't sure if she would need to defend herself from the mage or not.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The two pirates stood no chance. They had been debilitated. Mercy was an option, but none had shown any degree of remorse in what they were about to do. It was very likely indeed that they would be chasing another to steal from them before long, had they not met their ends. The grass and dirt below was now spattered with sprays and pools of blood. The mana that lingered in the air from Star's spell did very much to soothe and restore the knight before her. With all done, Star's reaction shifted from one of survival, of alert, adrenaline-widened eyes, to...Tears. She slid her arms around her own torso to give herself a self-hug. She bent forward slightly, head slightly hung as she bit her lower lip to try and fight back tears. Small trembles were visible in her frame. Eyes were shut tight. She tried to stifle her sniffles and choked, high-pitched sobs to some degree of success, but whatever was troubling her was still clearly too much for her to bear. Was it just shock? It certainly didn't seem like the first time she'd been in such a situation. So it did beg the question of what could produce such visceral and obvious sorrow in the woman.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra finished cleaning her rapier, eyes still on the woman now...crying. She wasn't quite sure how to approach or make the woman feel better; comforting a stranger was both not something she was comfortable with, or good at. Not to mention, suspicion was still heavily apparent. This could still very well be a trap, a way to ease her into thinking the woman was harmless. After that magic, Ellesandra wasn't going to let her guard down around the woman, at least not entirely. Sliding the rapier back into it's sheath, she stepped back to drag the men to the side and out of sight of the woman at least, since the death of others was likely to be a traumatizing factor if this woman hadn't seen death before. Staring at their dead bodies wouldn't help. It wasn't until after they were moved to the side that Ellesandra stepped back up towards the woman, and spoke. "You're safe now, miss. Did they injure you badly, anywhere?" There had been blood on the woman, though Ellesandra hadn't been able to get a good enough read on how injured she might have been. "I have some medical supplies in my pack, if you need them, but it also seems like you may be able to take care of the injuries via magic if that's easier for you?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had been quietly seeking her center while the knightly woman saw to putting the bodies out of the way in the nearby bushes. The vultures would certainly be along in the days to come if nobody found the corpses to deal with them. Nearby townsfolk would be unlikely to care enough to give these lawless bandits any proper rites. As Star cried, a soft blue aura slowly came over her. It was difficult to discern what the aura signified, but it was similar to the one she had when she attacked prior. Except...It swiftly shifted from its usual azure colour to a tumultuous mix of darker blues, reds, and purples. The colours certainly seemed to hold some sort of meaning, but...To an untrained eye it was little more than just what it was - a multicoloured aura. But as the bodies were tended to, as Star was given time, the colours slowly returned to a steady, azure blue. This coincided with Star's sobs and tears subsiding quite directly, to the point that when the aura was again one uniform colour, she had returned to steady breaths. She wiped at her eyes, taking measured breaths through her mouth to keep herself steady, then looked at Ellesandra when they spoke to her. She managed a half-smile and a nod at the notion of being safe, then a shake of the head at the question of being injured badly. "Just caught my cheek with their blade," she said, finally speaking. She had a gentle voice. Feminine and sweet, though still very subtly shaken. "That's very kind of you to offer. I can handle this small wound myself, though, you're right," she said, then moved one hand up to her own cheek. The tips of her fingers touched the wound, briefly glowing with soft white light once touching the wound. A few seconds of this passed, and when her fingers then removed again from the wound, it had ceased to be, leaving the skin unblemished and without so much as a mark to speak of. The streaks of red, the reminder of where the wound once was, remained, however. There was little sense wasting mana on what a wet cloth could accomplish, in her mind. She then moved her hands to her dress skirt, in all its feathery frills, and pinched either side with either hand to lift as she bowed in a pleasant curtsy to Ellesandra. "Thank you, as well, for coming to my aide. My name is Star Lumina. I typically travel with someone else who acts as my guardian, but..." She raised from the curtsy, then looked away from the other woman as discomfort overtook her face. "They are, erm...Indisposed...For the foreseeable future. I must admit I may have grown too comfortable with the safety that guardianship had afforded me, and thus complacent about how dangerous the realms can be." She returned her gaze to Ellesandra, a tiny blush coming over her cheeks at her honest admission. Despite having clearly powerful magic, she was, without a doubt, out of her depth.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had eyed the magical aura around Star cautiously, but hadn't made a move to stop whatever it was. When she watched the woman seem to gather herself and heard the sweet, feminine voice there was a momentary gut wrenching flashback. Guilt, pain, and grief hit her once again, hard enough that she actively took a step back from Star. Her jaw clenched and she fought it down, reminded herself that this was not the same. This woman - Star, she'd called herself - was not dying. If anything, she was more just traumatized by the experience, most likely. Taking a deep breath to help center her own emotions, Ellesandra nodded.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star noticed the reaction. She had noticed the distrust initially. She noticed it all. She couldn't understand the cause, only that her voice, something about her words, had caused a reaction. The shift of Elesandra's aura, the sudden pulse of heavy matte greys that bore down on them like a boulder. It evoked a sympathetic expression, though such expression would not give away that she could see more than the knight knew she could. "...I might have been able to, I just..." she blushed again, hands folded before her as she looked at the ground before her in...Shame? "I hesitated. Even though those men would have hurt me, I had hoped to get away without causing them harm." She gently shook her head with a sad chuckle. "I must sound pathetic," she said, looking back up to Ellesandra. "I could never ask to burden you with my protection, Miss Rhinelander. But I must...Also concede that it would be a great boon to me." She then pointed past Ellesandra, to the north-east. "...I was heading to Cloverport, just an hour's walk north-east from here, when these pirates intercepted me on the road. The main road just west of here will lead there. Though, erm...That is just a single stop in my journey." She lowered her arm, then took a deep breath and looked at Ellesandra more directly again. "...Perhaps it is foolhardy of me, but...The journey I am undertaking is one that I cannot abandon, no matter the perils I may face. So...Whatever aide you offer to me, I will only be able to selfishly accept." Some guilt, an emotion Ellesandra clearly knew well, overtook Star at that admission. A bold, assertive claim; for better or worse, she would not give up on whatever this quest of hers was.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The woman seemed to blush a lot. Was that attraction, or embarrassment? Ellesandra would assume the latter. Crossing her arms, she stood with her feet wide and looking up slightly at the woman, head tilted to the side. Her eyes were narrowed in what looked like a suspicious gaze, though the suspicion was much lower than it had been when she first encountered the pirates and Star. "I am not sorry for killing them, though I am sorry if my doing so caused you distress, Miss Lumina." The fact Star had hesitated because she hadn't wanted to kill the men was foolish, but Ellesandra fully understood that some people just didn't have it in them - especially some soft mages, like this woman seemed to be. Ellesandra had never seen magic like Star's, but that wasn't surprising; there were many kinds of magic in the world. After Star had commented on her current destination, and implied that it was only one stop on the journey, Ellesandra frowned. "First of all, it is not pathetic to require or admit you need help." A lesson that Ellesandra herself could learn from, but it was easier to give advice than follow it. "Foolish to try not to harm them. Even should you have succeeded in escaping, you would have simply left their next victim to it instead, but that would not have been your fault; only theirs." They turned to look in the direction Star had pointed, north-east, then back to her. "I will accompany you to Cloverport should you have my company, Miss Lumina. From there, I am open to be hired, or you may find another guard to hire on your journey should you prefer it. I would not recommend continuing whatever journey you are on alone."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently shook her head at the notion that the killing distressed her. "You have nothing to apologize for, truly," she said, then lowered her head as the brief lecture took place. Her face was that of a woman who understood all that Ellesandra said, but held a heart that stubbornly resisted the wisdom on offer. "You speak the truth. I know that fools who speak only in violence and refuse to hear reason must be spoken to with equal violence." She sighed, moving one hand to rub at her cheek. Understanding the truth was clearly no problem for her. Acting on it? Well, the intuition that some didn't have it in them was surely only reinforced by her reaction. She reset her posture and nodded to Ellesandra. "I...Am not exactly flush with coin. Hardly able to afford a brilliant knight as yourself, but...I appreciate your kindness in escorting me at least that far." She smiled. A quiet fear lingered behind her smile for what the future would bring, but her thankfulness was clear. Indeed, it was...Remarkably easy to discern Star's feelings at just a glance. To say she wore her heart on her sleeve didn't cut it - she held her heart out in both hands for all to see clearly, plainly, without needing to read deeper. Be it happiness, embarrassment, anger, sadness...Her face, her body language, was all unusually animated to the point that this woman had zero hope of ever hiding her true feelings from anyone who paid attention. A grinning, silver-tongued rogue she most certainly was not; such an image was her absolute antithesis.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra huffed softly, closing her eyes and then letting out a resigned sigh. She wouldn't say it, or offer it yet, but the idea of continuing with Star had already come into her head. Could she let this woman go off on her own for whatever misadventure and stubborn ideas she had in mind? It'd be all but letting her die, and it wasn't as if Ellesandra had anywhere else in specific to be. Still, she wasn't going to make that offer now; perhaps after seeing Star to the next town, and getting a better understanding of her and potentially her goal. Wiping her hands off in front of her, a physical attempt to wipe off the thought of killing those men and shrug it off, Ellesandra nodded towards the road. "Well, unless you need anything else here, we might as well get onto the road, Miss Lumina." Ellesandra would motion with a hand for Star to take the lead. "I will be right behind you and will ensure no one else might be around waiting for these three to return." It was possible; if these weren't their own small band of bandits they might have come from some local group that would be looking if they didn't return quickly. Ellesandra still had a stoic, cold look on their face, having not smiled once during their interaction. If anything, she looked tired - though that certainly wasn't a physical exhaustion.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently nodded to the notion that they should leave. She moved back the way she was being chased. Not a fully trodden road, but a wilderness path that had seen some foot traffic regularly enough to stomp down the underbrush to easily passed terrain existed. Nature-walkers likely made frequent passage. The walk along it wasn't terribly long, some ten minutes before they were back on the road properly. No other pirates could be seen passing or coming up behind them, though given the proximity to Cloverport, Ellesandra's vigilance wasn't unwarranted. Star allowed Ellesandra to take either the lead, the side, or behind her, whichever they felt most appropriate for escort. The town of Cloverport was vaguely visible on the horizon; a port-side town connected to a horseshoe-shaped lake that connected outward into the greater ocean. The rounded cove had natural defenses, and smaller encampments with ballistae defenses and guard towers could be seen dotting the edge of the lake. A mercantile hub, one that clearly had the potential to send pirate ships to the bottom of the ocean. So it begged the question of why these pirates had been ignored, to any astute onlooker. That all aside, they had a bit of walking to do, and no company but each other and the nearby woodland critters. Star stole occasional glances at Ellesandra, as if...Studying them. Then, set eyes forward with some pensive look upon her, only to look back at the knight again, once again studying them with curiosity, even if that meant rather obviously looking over her shoulder at them.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had followed along behind while in the woods so as to keep a better eye on Lumina, a duty that she took seriously now that she had agreed to take it on. When they got out to the road, she waited until Lumina began walking in the direction of the town to confirm it was the right direction before moving to fall into step beside Lumina. Ellesandra's caution was still up, especially considering what they'd just encountered; she kept her eye out and glanced around to the surrounding woods, behind them towards where they'd come from, and then down to the port city. If pirates had come from there, either they'd gone under the radar - which would be hard with how they were dressed - or the port city supported them in some way, which would make it quite dangerous as well. She looked over to Star, catching the woman studying her again, and let out a soft sigh. "If you have questions Miss Lumina, ask. There is no reason to to walk in silence if you have things to discuss." While Ellesandra herself was not much of a conversationalist, she also knew that after a situation like what just happened, having a conversation could help distract the woman from the trauma. Not only that, but get to know Ellesandra well enough to trust her with her protection. Ellesandra had just killed three men in front of her; it was entirely possible Star was thinking she was some cold blooded killer. She couldn't do her job well if Star didn't let her in or trust her with accurate information about their goals and destination.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was hardly surprised that she got caught staring. She wasn't being very subtle, after all. She scratched at her cheek, showing another flush of embarrassment for being called out on it. "S-Sorry," she began. "I don't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything, just..." She paused here, focusing on Ellesandra for a short while. Eyes that seemed to peer into Ellesandra's very soul. Indeed, she very well might be. She then shook her head. "I don't wish to pry into your personal matters. So please...Feel free to pretend I've said nothing at all...But I simply cannot ignore the weight I see bearing down on your shoulders. As if a mountain rests upon each of your pauldrons. I know it isn't my place, but...I cannot help that my heart tugs in my chest upon seeing it." She offered a smile at the conclusion of her words. A sympathetic smile. "I'm sure there are a thousand lighter topics to fill the air with as we walk...But the least I can do after being saved by you is offer you my ear, if talking might at all ease the weight. I know things are hardly so simple...But I can't help but extend the offer regardless."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't know what she had expected, but being asked about the 'weight on her shoulders' was not one of them. She'd thought Star was shy and wanted to get to know her, not that she could see through to Ellesandra's soul. Could she? Ellesandra frowned, the defensiveness and caution rising again. She also seemed to pull within herself, walls raising to protect herself from the question. "There is no mountain." Her voice came out in a snap, harsh and discordant. It was unintentional, not having intentionally set out to be rude to Star, but the fact that they had JUST met and she was prying into something she very much did not earn information to? Ellesandra closed herself up, jaw clenching and eyes focused straight forward rather than looking over to Star and seeing how her harsh words might have effected her. "And nothing to lend an ear for. I am here to ensure you get to Cloverport, not to share my life story." She wanted to clench her fists, to cross her arms, to distance herself more from Star, but she restrained that. She didn't want to intimidate the woman into not feeling comfortable with her, and distancing herself didn't make sense when it was her job to ensure she was safe. It was best to stay close for that purpose. She opened her mouth to ask Star a question of her own, just to redirect the topic, but then closed it. She didn't know what to ask, and didn't feel like it was appropriate to do so if she herself had just denied truly answering a question asked of her.

Perhaps surprisingly, Star didn't react poorly to Ellesandra closing off. Her smile remained, and her expression quietly spoke of how the response was expected. Her eyes also showed knowledge that refuted Ellesandra's lies. No mountain, they insisted, as Star saw it plain as day crumbling down upon their shoulders in crashing waves of grey and black, like tar clinging to them and making every movement twice as weighted. "I did say I aimed not to pry, and you were welcome to pretend I'd said nothing," she said, keeping her smile. Her eyes returned forward, then, as she continued. "Allow me, then, to give a bit more context to my journey, so you might have something to listen to as we walk." She kept her eyes forward. Her expression showed a smile, a force of strength. But there was a pain that lingered under that smile, shown with a plain openness that stood a firm foil to Ellesandra's closed off stance. "Humour me for a moment, if you will, and consider what you might know to be the rarest magic you've ever known. Even if you aren't exposed to much of the world of magic, I'm sure a knight like yourself has come to see some things more common than others. A fireball is perhaps the most ubiquitous magic there is. That would fall under the school of 'Evocation'. Evoking the forces of nature, of the elements. Controlling flames, winds, lightning, all things of that sort. Next you might consider more esoteric magics like...Teleportation, revival, necromancy. Still common enough, their power and nature notwithstanding, to be known on the common tongue. Take a step further, and you might get into magic that is known only to a select group of people, like druidic magic. Step further, and you enter the world of mystics. People whose magic starts to become as unique as the individual themselves. And when we arrive into that circle, that's, well...About where you might find me. Where other magic users might have dozens, hundreds of other magi, and thousands of books to reference about others like them that have come before that wielded the same magic as them..." She paused again, taking in a slow breath. "...There's only one other person in the whole world who I've ever known that has the same magic as me. And it is imperative that I find them again, not only to hope to preserve this magic of ours, but also, to a smaller extent, for my own sake. For closure, and for the potential betterment of my own understanding of myself, and my magic. If they are still alive, they are the only person who can guide me on using my magic to its fullest. And if they are dead...Then..." She struggled to form the words that encapsulated her feelings on this matter. "...Then I need to know. Because I cannot move on until I do."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't know what to say as Star pointed out that she could have just ignored the question. It was true, she could have, but her instinct had been to snap back. Push the woman away to make her think asking about that wasn't acceptable. The right thing to do probably would have just been ignoring her, but she was never quite so good at ignoring her emotions in instinct. In time she could repress them, surely, but that just made her angry overall. A deep breath was taken, not looking over at Star or seeing the pain in her eyes at all. In fact, Ellesandra looked everywhere EXCEPT at Star, knowing she'd probably gone too far with the harsh words. Yet, the mage had continued on to explain things as if they hadn't been harsh at all. "I certainly haven't seen magic like yours before." Ellesandra admitted, taking the bone Star had thrown her in regards to the topic change. There being only one other person in the world who had the same type of magic was probably frustrating when it came to learning it, and perhaps they were even family? Didn't unique magic lines tend to run through family blood? It sounded like a lonely journey, if Star was taking this search on her own. "Is this person you are looking for the guardian you mentioned?" She had mentioned having a guardian who was no longer available. The way it had been phrased was suspicious at the time, though if Star didn't know what happened to them and was searching for them that would explain it. She likely wouldn't want to admit the person might be dead, but also didn't want to hope otherwise. That's how Ellesandra would feel, anyways. The tension had reduced a little, listening to Star speak and asking questions in return. She was still more guarded than even when she first saw Star and the pirates, the question having certainly put her guard up, but it was quickly relaxing back to normal again. The soft clunk of her metal boots hitting the dirt beneath them, along with where her breastplate met her skirt, was a familiar accompanying sound to her walking and pacing.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"No, not that guardian I mentioned. That guardian's name is Nina. She's an old friend. And half the reason my first instinct to talk about common magics is fireballs," she said with a giggle. "Nina is a kind soul. And a fiery one. Quite literally. She possesses a soul touched by a powerful phoenix, so when I say she is indisposed, well...I mean to say she was killed. I didn't want to start with that because it sounds grim, but that phoenix within her means that she returned to life from her own ashes. A taxing process, but one she will recover from in due time. Alas, that is time I cannot remain idle, hence you finding me on my lonesome," she said, keeping her tone spirited through her words. Truly, as much as it did mean Star did very much need help for the foreseeable future, it was surely heartening to know that her dear friend wasn't truly gone. "In a year or so, she may be able to serve as my guardian again. But in truth? Part of me wishes to allow her to pursue her own life. I don't wish to shackle her with my woes, much as I'm certain she wouldn't characterize it like that," she said, giggling again. A fondness for this friend was obvious. But the two were far, far apart now. "No, the person I'm looking for is, erm...My mother." Star's tone dropped to a more sorrowful one with those words. She couldn't know how close Ellesandra was to guessing the truth before she said it. But it did certainly explain the struggles Star had with the topic. "Her name is Aurora Lumina, not that I expect anyone here to know that name. We are...Not in the right realm for anyone to know her. In fact, the first step of my journey, before I can even begin to try and find her again is...Finding a way to return home, to where I was born. To where my mother most likely is, whether she still lives or not. A far more difficult task than simply finding the path on a map and walking it, I'm afraid."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra finally glanced back at Star when she mentioned her friend, Nina, had died. Even if she was a phoenix and apparently returning to life, in some form or fashion, losing a friend couldn't be great. "Sorry to hear." Ellesandra's words were soft, spoken with a pain and sympathy of one who has known loss. And unfortunately for Ellesandra, this loss wasn't one that returned to life after a time. Looking back forwards, Ellesandra rested her right hand on the top of her rapier hilt while they walked, thumb and finger lightly tapping into the metal in a tick that she didn't even realize she had, but one that provided comfort for her all the same. "I've not heard of this Mrs. Lumina." Ellesandra confirmed in regards to not knowing the name. The right realm comment made Ellesandra glance sideways to her again before she continued. "So do you have a specific destination in which you will be able to return to your own realm? Also, if I may ask, you mentioned needing to find your mother in order to ensure your magic doesn't die out. Would you not be able to sustain your magic by having kids of your own, or is your magic not passed down via blood?" She paused, then quickly added. "If you don't mind sharing. I understand many mages, especially those of particularly unique blood lines, are sensitive to the secrets their magic may carry. I have no desire to pry into it." Ellesandra herself was a simple spellsword; she was capable of other magics, but not talented at it. The only unique magic she had was that of being able to reutilize the mana, energy within a spell; to absorb it, though she had never known where that particular ability came from.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star sputtered at the notion of her having children. Her face was now emulating the ripest of tomatoes. "W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Well...A-Ah, uhm, you see, I...Uhm...That is...Aaah...Uhm..." This stammering continued for a short while. She tapped her index fingers together, idly spun some of her snow-white hair around one index, and idly fidgeted with her hands in general while trying to answer that question. "...I-It is, well, passed through lineage, s-so, that much is true! B-But the ideal would s-still be that I, erm...H-Have a little guidance on the matter before I go...Thinking about...T-That..." Her words quieted to a whisper by the end of that. There was other matters to discuss, but the notion of children had thrown Star for such a loop that the rest got lost in translation, and now she was just...Silently steaming in her own head while waiting for the knight's reply, still as bright red in the cheeks as could be.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected the notion of kids to fluster the mage so. She looked over and for the briefest of seconds, amusement passed through them. There was even a very small uptick to the corner of their mouth at the sight of Star stammering and going red enough that she looked like steam would come out of her ears. Looking forward, Ellesandra spoke again. "My apologies, Miss Lumina. I did not intend to embarrass you or imply kids were your only option. Many people eschew such things, or are incapable of creating such, and there would be no shame in such." Ellesandra wasn't sure if Star was simply inexperienced and thus flustered at the concept, or if it was embarrassment for a reason such as being unable to. It didn't matter; apparently the topic had been quite intense for Star, so Ellesandra felt the need to apologize. The amusement had faded quickly, only showing briefly, but it did lighten Ellesandra's mood a little. Her guard was still up, but it wasn't being held up firmly; it was more that Ellesandra's natural state was to have it up as she went about her daily life.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star needed a bit of time to recoup from that, but her blush was going to be sustained for a little while as she tried to move those thoughts out of her mind to refocus on other topics. She gently shook her head. "N-No, it's okay. It's not your fault. I-I suppose I just, well, had never really focused on that quite as much. N-Not even so much romantic prospects, l-let alone.." She shook her head again, more vigorously this time. A soft huff followed as she sought composure once more. She wasn't about to go on to say how she was perfectly capable, or so she assumed, or other embarrassing subjects about herself with this woman she'd just met, mostly because it would be a little too much information, so she sought to pivot. "A-Anyway...U-Uhm." Deep breath. "I, er...I want to understand myself, first and foremost, is I suppose the point I'm getting at. Not that I'm...Going to turn away from any romantic prospects that might arise, but for the moment I have a clear direction that has made maintaining long-standing friendships...Difficult. There are many who are not cut out for a vagrant life rife with dangers, and there's no shame in that. I just...Hope to brighten the lives of those I encounter, when I do encounter them, you know?" She asked with a smile. The two were getting closer to the city. The sun was still high in the sky, so there were plenty of hours of daylight left for them to make use of. Another ten or so minutes of walking and they would hit the outskirts.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had to bite back her initial response of calling Star on her...inexperience. Not calling so much, but commenting on it and calling her flustered attitude cute. It wasn't appropriate, or needed from a stranger. Instead, she looked off towards the outskirts of the town, keeping an eye out even as they approached. If those pirates had come from here, it was entirely possible there were more. "It is entirely valid to want to find yourself before finding a partner or considering children. And admirable that you recognize it may not be the best time to actively search, Miss Lumina." Her words had gone back to the formal way of speaking, which for her was a more relaxed situation compared to when she'd snapped at the mage. Still, Ellesandra would change the topic - both for Star to not get too embarrassed, and also to redirect their thoughts to the path ahead. "We are near the city and have daylight to burn. Did you have a plan upon arriving, a ship you were intending to get on? If not, I would recommend finding a place to stay for the night before travelling on to the next location, we're far enough along in the day that starting off now wouldn't be entirely wise, especially considering the attack that already happened on this road."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star showed the appreciation in her face at the change of topic. Some time for her to cool off. She nodded to the question about a plan. "Mmn. There's someone in town I'm meeting. I was told they might have information about how to get to the next leg of my journey. I...Somehow doubt it will be a straight forward affair, and may not be without its cost, but...I will figure something out once I meet them. I was referred to someone named Morrun Dayflower. A high elven scholar who had some information about a lead I was chasing. All sounds very vague, I'm sure, but when we sit down with him I'm sure it'll make more sense. I don't intend on getting on a ship, though, no. Unless the next destination requires it. And I do have enough money for a night at an inn, assuming they are keeping reasonable prices, if we need to stay around. That being said, if the pirates are making this place a home, I might sooner find camp among the trees if there are no storm clouds this night. Not that I don't feel infinitely safer around someone like you, but, I would not shackle you to a night if you have somewhere else to be," she said, offering a genuine smile at Ellesandra. "I'm not one for needless conflict, regardless. The sight of death disturbs me greatly, even if I know in my mind it was righteously done."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was surprised, and considered commenting, on Star's use of 'we'. Was she taking for granted that Ellesandra would accompany her for such? She had only technically agreed to see her to the city safely, though Star had a good point that if the city was overtaken by pirates it might be safer to sleep outside of the city. After listening to the rest, she decided not to call Star out on her assumption that Ellesandra would join her. For now, she would. Instead she ran the name Morrun Dayflower through her mind to figure out if she had heard of them. She hadn't, but she'd met many a mage in one of her last jobs and sometimes had to focus on trying to think of them and who all she met. "What exactly was your plan, if you were to run out of money? Surely you didn't expect to be able to find your mother so quickly on limited funds, if you're at the point of commenting about having enough money to stay the night at an inn." Typically, that was a given for travelers. If Star were so hard up on coin to make that an active consideration, Ellesandra couldn't imagine how she was planning to finish her journey entirely on her own. "And you mentioned a cost from this Morrun for getting you to the right realm as well." They added in consideration for that. Was Star just going on a whim and hoping things fell into place? Ellesandra felt both an irritation at such foolishness, and a protectiveness of the naivety of it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently shook her head. "I've always been able to find work healing. It's just been a long road since I was in a major settlement. I admit there are times I will pass up compensation for what I do when I'm in a squalid town. There's little joy in taking from those who live in houses with roofs in disrepair that catch the rainwater in pots, and have to grovel to the local lords come time for tax collection, even if I myself am hard off. A place like Cloverport is sure to have more work for me; I simply meant to say that extortionist prices aren't worth the comfort when I am well-enough accustomed to life among nature," she said, hoping her correction put things in better perspective. She had coin, she just had to ration it. A mindset for the long term, rather than the immediate. Suffering now for comfort later. "I've been searching for my mother for several years now. Since I was nineteen, in fact. I'm twenty-three now. Before that, I did what I could to find any information about my magics. I'm sure you can imagine with my previous comments how well that went," she said, giving a soft grin at the notion. "As for the cost, well. I don't suspect it will be coin. Often, magi trade in lore, artifacts, or services. I do not know what Morrun will want. Speculation helps me little. The best I can do is step forward, be open and honest, and see where that path will take me. Of course...The years traveling have made me better able to know when that approach is best substituted for a more...Evasive one. But I guess you'll just have to trust me when I tell you I have a pretty infallible eye for when someone has less than pure intentions. I knew from the moment I saw you that I could trust you, after all, even before you challenged the pirates. And I could tell you didn't exactly trust me right away." She kept a smile about her as she spoke so plainly about this. "I don't blame you, of course. I'm a strange woman with strange magic, and these roads can be dangerous to everyone, even someone as stalwart as yourself."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt surprise, and a little bit of shame at how quickly she'd jumped to assumptions about Star. Apparently, she'd thought this out more than she'd thought originally. Nodding along to the explanation Star gave, and the apparent soft heart she had, Ellesandra felt herself thankful that she'd happened upon the bandits ambush in time. Someone like Star seemed to be the type of person this world needed more of, and it would have been quite a shame if those men had decided to kill her. "I apologize, Miss Lumina, for my assumption then. You seem to have prepared and planned for this more than I initially expected." She listened as Star explained how she had a good eye for someone's intentions, and that she could tell Ellesandra had not trusted her. She still didn't trust Star, not entirely anyways. She trusted Star not to randomly attack her, or maybe not to try to steal her purse, but she didn't really trust the mage yet. It would take more than a single conversation on an hour's long walk to get to that. "I mean no offense to you, of course Miss Lumina, for my lack of trust. It's entirely focused on experience, not that you seem untrustworthy." A nod was given to the idea of the strange magic. "And not understanding your magic doesn't help with that. But then again, magic isn't the best way to take me out, considering my own abilities around it." She was vague on purpose, not wanting to make it so that Star would understand enough to be able to work around such abilities.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I did say I don't blame you, didn't I?" she said, smiling at Ellesandra. She clearly took no offense. "You wouldn't be the first person to assume me some naiive, innocent woman. And while I do indeed hold good intentions for any who share those towards me, I am also aware that it has the duality of both...Inviting evil-doers to take advantage, as well as...Lulling those same evil-doers into consistently underestimating me. I do...Very much detest having to use my powers for harm. But I must, at times, as a last resort. Being outnumbered, however is...Still a major disadvantage." She gave another smile. Would she have come out of that okay? Maybe. But the likely scenario was that she took far more grievous wounds in the process. Her minimal injury remained possible thanks to the knight at her side. She took note of how Ellesandra was...Not a prime target for magic, and took note of this in the back of her mind, but did not press the issue. The two had arrived at the city outskirts at this point. The port city was busy, but not overly bustling. Guards at the gate stood in towers with crossbows; a stone perimeter wall surrounded the whole of the city. Things looked to be business as usual. Once inside the gates, the port to the east was the primary attraction, but the north and western faces of the city had plenty of businesses. A tavern, an inn, a smith, a breadmaker, several clothiers that sported sail-related signage that were doubtlessly adept at mending torn ship sails, among several other more niche businesses. But as the two moved through the city, one thing would be clear: The red and white striped shirts of the pirates featured on many others within the city. No ship in the port was flying the Jolly Roger flag, but...These pirates had gotten into the city, and were pervasive through it. They appeared to be keeping lawful, though some less than subtle cat-calls were made at Ellesandra and Star from the periphery. Star chose to ignore them and step onwards, aiming to head towards The Salty Salmon tavern, which appeared to be quite the main attraction at the center of the city. But if the knight saw fit to cause a scene, Star would stick by their side through it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra knew Star had said she didn't blame her, but that didn't mean she shouldn't be polite and apologize for such an expectation. She continued walking while listening to Star's explanation, feeling their gut tighten at the thought. "If only everyone had expectations of said duality." The words were mumbled to herself, not necessarily intended for Star to hear. The guilt intensified, fully wrapping around a core of sorrow that settled deep in her gut. She took a deep breath, and the emotions bundled up and were pushed down, being well and truly ignored once again. She'd gotten quite good at that. As they made their way into the city, Ellesandra became more on guard. They made sure to walk a bit closer to Star, ensuring any onlookers knew they were together and not just walking side by side, and that Star was under Ellesandra's protection. She had to resist the temptation to reach out and touch the small of Star's back, a habit in a similar situation in her past. It was interesting how people who looked similar to the pirates, and how multiple of them seemed to be roaming the city. This realization made Ellesandra walk with her right hand resting on the top of the rapier hilt, though she continued walking forward as if there weren't a problem at all. If there was anything she was good at, it was being on guard without looking like she was paranoid or activley watching everything. "You know the way to this contact of yours, Miss Lumina?" She asked, looking straight forward while keeping an eye on both of their purses as they entered the city with more people here and there. Cat calls were entirely ignored; it would only bring attention to them if they did anything about it prior to the callers getting more aggressive.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I was told to meet them here," she said, gesturing to The Salty Salmon tavern that was soon before them. The bustle of the core of the city could be heard from here, mostly as a dull roar in the background. Closer to the ports sat an open-air market that held most of the congestion of the city. Things of all nature being traded, possibly even less legal things in the darker corners. If the two should have to travel through that space, coin-purses would need near constant supervision, surely. Ignoring that, Star had kept an eye on Ellesandra as much as they kept an eye on everyone else. Star did have a habit of staring, it seemed. Whatever she might be looking at would remain a mystery for the time being, but she certainly seemed to be looking for, or at...Something. That attention stopped when they reached the tavern and pushed inside. The interior was decently busy. Not too many free tables, and the happy jaunt of a bard strumming a lute somewhere on the left side of the interior could be heard. A sea shanty, it seemed, as the lyrics waxed on about woes of a life at sea, hungry bellies and wet clothes in chasing a golden payday. Star took a rather direct route through the tavern to the right and towards the back. Seemed she had been given a precise meeting place. She joined a lone elven man at his table that had room for four. The man eyed Ellesandra, however, with a look that suggested they were an unexpected addition to the meeting. "Morrun?" asked Star. The elven man nodded. In the dull light of the tavern, Morrun's darker, moonlight-toned complexion made the shadows cling tightly to him. He was quite tall, clearly, but quite thin as well. Spectacles made his dull brown eyes larger than they were while looking at him. His brown hair was in a tight ponytail, though his hair wasn't terribly long. "Star, I take it?" asked the man in return. Star nodded. "And this is Ellesandra. She has graciously been my escort to the city," she said, notably keeping the introduction in line with their agreement. To the city, and nothing more. Morrun gave a small hum of acknowledgement. "Right. Well. I heard you were looking for magic that could help you divine a location, and then presumably get there," asked the elven man, his expression rather neutral as the two discussed business. He didn't give away much of anything in the way of what he might be thinking or feeling beyond the initial surprise of Ellesandra's presence, but he quickly accepted that as well. Star nodded to the man's summation. "That's about right. I was told you had information on the matter," Star replied. Morrun nodded. "Aye. I've got a lead for you. Not directly the magic you're looking for, but...A nugget. A trail you can follow that will get you closer to it," he said, then drew in a swift sniff. He eased back in his chair, crossing his arms. His arms, like the rest of him, were thin. The frame of a scholar, not a fighter. He had a pack by his feet which presumably contained some of his materials; the wooden ends of a scroll were visible poking out of the top if one leaned to look under the table to spy it. "...But I've got two conditions." He struck a stern expression as he said this. Preparing for pushback on the notion, perhaps, and ready to meet it firmly. Star didn't respond immediately, instead...Eyeing the man in a way that was vaguely similar to the way she studied Ellesandra along the way to the city. Just looking at him, as if she saw something. Whatever the case, it gave a pause in the conversation, if Ellesandra had anything to add.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt relieved when they reached their destination. Being inside a tavern might not be entirely safe either, but at the very least she wouldn't have to keep an eye on all the crowd. Normally this wasn't as bit of an issue, but with the pirates and the encounter Star had previously had with them already Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable with any of them. She did notice Star watching her, but didn't think anything of it, assuming this was simply Star being cautious about her as well, or finding something interesting. Perhaps her armor, or her demeanor or something? There were even some people who were interested in the color of her hair at a young age, though based on Star's own hair that was unlikely. She nodded, and let Star lead them into the tavern with a glance at the sign and name hanging before them. Salty Salmon seemed like a perfect name for a tavern in a port city, playing up to the fisherman or pirate customers. She followed Star in and did a quick sweep of the room, eyes scanning different doors and potential exits other than the front door just in case anything went down that required a quick escape. The fact they walked to the back corner of the room made Ellesandra uncomfortable, as it was likely going to put their backs to the rest of the room. She made no attempt to hide her perusal of the man sitting, also eyeing her. A quick assessment of any weapons that were obvious on his form, and then only giving him a brief nod when Star introduced her. As the two began to discuss business, Ellesandra stepped around the table, to the side. This put her a bit further from Star, but it allowed her the ability to keep an eye both on the room and on this man, Morrun, without having to constantly turn her head or look behind her. It also placed her back to one of the walls, which was ideal. Her arms crossed, listening into the conversation while taking up a practiced bodyguard's unseeing stare past Star. An illusion of privacy, as if Ellesandra wasn't there listening even if she was. Her lips were pressed into a thin line at the conditions comment, though no response given. This was Star's business to deal with.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pause in conversation lasted a few moments, Star and the elven man eyeing one another closely. Star eventually nodded. "Very well, what are they?" she asked, her voice more or less unchanged. She had mentioned expecting this, so it was likely little surprise how calmly she received it. Morrun gave a terse nod, then laid out his conditions: "First, five thousand gold pieces. Upfront. Non-negotiable," he said, his voice firm. Considering that a skilled bodyguard like Ellesandra could expect between one and at most five gold pieces per day for their services as a very well accomplished knight, and that a night's stay at the local inn was only eight silver - with ten silver to one gold - a price of five thousand gold was laughable. Absurd. A small fortune, and for what? Vague information? Despite the absurdity, Star said nothing, allowing the man to continue. "...And the other is that if your exploration of my valuable information bears fruit, I require a full report of your findings for my own study." By contrast, a far more reasonable request, though still arguably pompous on the man's part. Star gave another pause. She then tilted her head slightly. "What do you need the gold for?" she inquired simply. The man's brows knit and he leaned forward on the table, supported on his elbows. "The information I have is worth as much! It's none of your business what I use it for," he scoffed back, indignant. Star remained calm and composed in the face of this. She then lowered her voice to a volume that would make it so only the man and Ellesandra would be able to overhear: "...Why are you lying?" she asked, causing the man to grit his teeth and leer at Star. "Wh...What are you talking about? I've said no word of a lie!" he insisted, his tone hushing to match hers. His eyes then began to dart around, looking at some of the other patrons in the bar. Those patrons in question didn't seem to take notice of the discussion, though with Ellesandra's watch, it would be easy to pick up on some...Wandering eyes. Certain folk in the tavern were carrying on about their business with their tablemates, but also occasionally did look over at the table with Star and Morrun. Not directly spying, but...Seemed their meeting had some interest to certain folk present, who were trying - and failing - to be subtle about it. At least failing under the scrutiny of the experienced knight, that is. Nobody was standing up. Nobody was encroaching. But people were watching. Possibly listening. But there'd be no listening in on the current hushed voices. "You are lying," said Star, still hushed. "You grew nervous talking about the condition of gold. You were calm talking about the second condition, however. And when I asked you what the gold was for, you had a very large rise in anxiety. And now as I'm explaining to you how I know you're lying, your anxieties are getting stronger. You're...Scared about something. Guilty, as well," she went on to explain, her voice still kind as ever, even as she dissected the man's heart like it was laying on the table. If Ellesandra had been observing the man, they would not have been able to notice any clear tells about anything Star was saying. Perhaps Star was just bluffing? Morrun looked visibly shaken by this, however. "W-What are you doing? Reading my mind or something?!" he asked, keeping his voice low despite his clear anxiety. Star smiled and shook her head. "No. But that does say rather plainly that I am right, doesn't it?" she replied, still smiling. "If you'd just be honest, then perhaps I can help you. Because I certainly don't have five thousand gold to my name." Another pause in the conversation appeared, as the man was sent reeling and deliberating. His nervous demeanor, however, had earned the scrutiny of a pirate-looking fellow at another table. A suspicious eye trained on Morrun, suggesting some manner of...Investment in the elven man's dealings.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Was Star able to read people? not minds, Ellesandra didn't expect that was possible if she'd gotten into the position she'd been in before. She could have used that against the pirates if so, or maybe not even have gotten caught. But some people were just empaths, able to easily read someone's body language and tell how they were feeling. Was that why Star had kept looking at her during their walk? Could she tell that Ellesandra was working through her guilt at the memories Star brought up? Her jaw clenched at the thought, glancing towards Morrun for a moment to ensure that he didn't respond poorly at being called out, then back out into the tavern room. The pirate looking fellow keeping a suspicious eye on Morrun had her guard up, and though she obviously looked at him once when she first noticed him, she didn't keep an eye directly on him. Doing so would only alert him that she'd caught him staring with too much interest. Instead, she began looking at other tables, both to keep him in peripheral vision and also to see if there were any others that were looking towards the pirate man, or also looking towards their table. She did lean down briefly to whisper to Star, completely ignoring Morrun. "Heads up, Miss Lumina, your contact here has the active interest of at least one pirate in the tavern." It was a validation of what Lumina was saying, as well as encouraging Morrun to put his cards on the table. He couldn't exactly deny it at this point, not with how well Star had read him and that Ellesandra had called out he was being actively watched. Whether or not he actually did so would be up to him, but most would understand that sharing that information would be beneficial to getting any actual business done.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A brief time passed as Morrun weighed his options. Star leaned into the whisper that Morrun was certainly intended to hear as well, and nodded. She looked at him, once more studying him. Eventually, his conviction broke, and he sighed. "...Look," he began, quiet as he could be while still being audible. "The pirates. They took my wife. They tried to extort me, and when I said I didn't have the gold, they took her as...Collateral," he said, nearly spitting the final word. "They want five thousand gold as ransom, or who knows what they'll do. Who knows what they've already done," he said, moving his left hand up to push through his hair. A golden wedding band with green etching depicting an elvish phrase was on his ring finger. Not immediately obvious in the dim light, but visible if one was looking for it. Star's expression softened dramatically, not that it was ever particularly hard in the first place. Star moved to touch the thin lines of dried blood that were on her cheek, briefly closing her eyes as she did. "Mmn. I'm no stranger to their barbarity. I'm very sorry to hear that has happened to you, Morrun. I will get her free again for you and get her out of the city. So you'll do well to find a way to slip out without attracting attention." Just like that, Star was jumping head-first into what was obviously a dangerous situation. Not counting the deck-hands on the ship itself, the city had plenty more of a pirate presence. Enough to suggest theirs was one of the larger vessels in port. Did Star have a plan? It would be hard to assume she did, given the whole two minutes she had to come up with one. But she'd already proven in the past to be a thoughtful woman...So it would be difficult to know. Naturally, this had Morrun...More than a little skeptical. "Wh- You can't be serious," he said with a chuckle. A chuckle that was asking to be laughed along with. "This is...This is a joke, right?" he continued, looking at Star, then Ellesandra. "L-Look, I obviously want her back, more than anything. But, like...Are ye' blind, woman? Have you not seen how many of them there are? And no offence to either of you, but they've each got as much muscle in their arms as you do in your whole body. And much as your uh, escort there, looks plenty mean...I think you'll be needing about five of her at least to hold your own." Through all of Morrun's doubts, Star never buckled. She maintained an air of serenity and calm about her, as if the danger before her was trivial. It wasn't. She already showed how just three pirates were a danger for her. Was Star truly insane? So determined to do the right thing that she'd carelessly lay down her life just to try? One look at her said very clearly that she wasn't scared, if nothing else..

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced quickly back at Morrun when he mentioned they had taken his wife. A frown creased her face, but that was the only emotion that she displayed for people to see. Displeasure on her face, which could easily have been taken for him making an unreasonable demand. Her eyes narrowed at him for a moment, then looked back out onto the room to keep up guard. It would not, however, be hard for Star to see the anger that burned bright in Ellesandra. There was a desire, briefly, to walk over to the pirate who was keeping an eye on Morrun and just slam his head into the table. She would never do this, of course. She was too well trained and restrained to start something like this, but the desire to do so was there. She hadn't considered how she was going to respond to the situation when Star apparently volunteered to help save the woman. Ellesandra looked back at Star with alarm. "Miss Lumina" She said in protest, placing a hand on the table and partially leaning over it to mask her mouth movements as she spoke. "While I can empathize with wishing to help rescue this man's wife, that is a very dangerous activity to take on." For once, she actually agreed with this Morrun fellow; this had to be a joke. Ellesandra could take on a handful of pirates without magic surely, but a whole ship of them, potentially more? "If they are trained like the ones in the woods I can take on four or five together without magic I think, but a whole ship is pushing it even with magic, Miss Lumina." Nowhere in this had Star volunteered Ellesandra to help with this, but there was an unspoken expectation that Ellesandra was not letting Star do that alone.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had looked at Ellesandra briefly when the flash of anger rose up within them. Something that might be a little too coincidental. But it was brief and subtle enough to be overshadowed by other things. The tag-team of the elven man and the knight trying to talk her out of this had Star smiling even wider. To the point of giggling under her breath. Her bright, positive outlook was immune in that moment. "Well, there you both go assuming I had planned to fight. I did tell you I'm not so much a fan of doing that, didn't I, Miss. Rhinelander?" she said, mysterious as she was chipper about it all. "I know you're just as angry inside about this situation as I am," she continued, speaking to Ellesandra. "So you can rest just as easy as Morrun here. I'll take care of it. You've already saved me from danger once, so I'll do my absolute utmost to ensure it needn't be twice in one day, all right?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't notice the coincidental glance in time with their anger, but they did notice how Star seemed to call her anger out. Her eyebrows knitted in confusion for a moment, wondering if her anger had really been that noticeable on her face. She was usually better at keeping her anger in check on jobs, since it was a pretty important thing to make your client happy with you and if you were expressing anger at them they would feel uncomfortable. Taking a deep breath to work the anger down and mentally scold themselves for being so readable, they looked over to Morrun, then back out into the tavern. "Well, what exactly is your plan then, Miss Lumina? We've had but a few minutes of learning this, don't know what ship they're on or if she's even on the ship." Maybe Ellesandra was jumping to conclusions right now. Perhaps Star only really planned to do some information gathering, not actually go on a rescue mission. That would make more sense. Still, Star was giggling - did she not understand the danger she'd be in if the pirates caught her, based on how many they seem to have seen in town? Sure if so many were in town there might be a chance fewer were on the ship, but they had no idea what numbers they might be looking at.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star took note of the breath. The internal revision. The self-scolding. While Star couldn't know what precisely was going on in the woman's head, she knew enough about emotional patterns to take a solid guess. So it was, Star was left with a knowing, sympathetic smile on her lips. She didn't say a word about it, but looking at her, she certainly seemed to know...Something. But how could she? Had Ellesandra been so plain? Morrun similarly had been quite stalwart in hiding any emotion, and yet Star sniffed it out with only a few moments of that...Curious, studious gaze. How strange, indeed. With all said, Star looked at Morrun. "Can you point out which ship is theirs?" she asked. Morrun hastily nodded. "They've a few in port, but the primary galleon of their fleet is where she's being held," he said, keeping a hush about him to prevent unwanted listeners. "I saw them take her aboard. Couldn't tell you where inside, but...The captain's probably on the ship, too, an' he's a mean fucker. Are you...Sure you know what you're doing? He's not really one to be persuaded by anything but gold," Morrun went on to say. Star gently shook her head. "I wouldn't try to reason with them. Or rather...I already did try to do that, and it didn't work out so well," she said, offering a nervous giggle as she once more called reference back to Ellesandra's intervention. "So? What are you going to do?" he asked, looking at Ellesandra briefly as he echoed their request to know what Star was planning. Star took a moment to collect her thoughts, then nodded to herself. "I'm going to board the ship, find your wife, and take her to the outskirts of the city. The only part I still need to figure out is...How to get you, Morrun, out of the city without raising suspicion. All the pirates in the tavern here are on edge, likely expecting a big payday. They're undoubtedly going to have questions about how our meeting went. So we'll need to have something convincing that keeps them from thinking something is amiss. It might help if we make a louder announcement of agreement, to make it seem like I'm going to abide by the initial terms of payment." While it seemed Star had put a good deal of thought into this, the arguably most important part - the rescue - was something she seemed quite content to just leave at her just...Walking aboard and taking a prisoner away, as if she expected the pirates to be perfectly content with this plan of hers. Once more, Morrun was looking with exceptional uncertainty at Ellesandra, as if seeking confirmation from the knight as to whether Star was sane or not.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was similarly disappointed with Star's current plan of just walking on board this pirate ship and getting the prisoner. She crossed her arms, her face all but in a permanent frown during this conversation. Ellesandra was also concerned about this supposed captain on board. It took every ounce of her willpower not to ask Star if she had lost her mind, but she had to assume the woman had some sort of plan, right? She didn't seem to be suicidal, considering her mission and determination to find her mother. A glance was given to Morrun, all but meeting his eye and agreeing with him in regards to Star being crazy. Ellesandra considered whether or not she should just walk away. A glance towards the door was given and the thought crossed her mind, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Not only would that likely be condemning the man's wife, but even Star for whatever foolish plan she was going with. "I strongly disagree with this course of action, Miss Lumina. It isn't worth this." Her voice was loud enough to be heard this time. Her words were true, but she also knew that saying such out loud would make the listening in pirates think that Star was planning to actually pay the 5000 gold to Morrun, not that Star was planning to rescue his wife.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
And without missing a beat, Star was right alongside Ellesandra's lead, speaking aloud. "You might disagree with the price of a life, Miss. Rhinelander. But it's obvious. They have all the power, all the control. We'll have to find a way to gather up the money and pay the ransom," she said, smiling a knowing smile at Ellesandra. She then spoke quietly. Quietly enough for just Ellesandra to hear: "Please...Trust me. I won't be dying today," she said, then drew in a slow breath. "Hopefully, nobody else has to die today. I know I have already asked much of you, but...You're much more likely able to defend Morrun if it comes to that. Would I...Be able to rely on you to escort him beyond the city limits, into the northern forests?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well, Ellesandra wouldn't have gone so far as to talk about the ransom out loud. Maybe just agreeing to the terms about paying the 5,000 for this service. Still, Ellesandra didn't SHOW the surprise on her face, even if she felt it. And a little bit of irritation and worry directed at Star for being so upfront about it. The pirates might not be happy that Morrun had spoken to them of the ransom, rather than just requesting the money from them. A glance was given his way, then back to Star. "I will not let you go face whatever you are doing alone. Not without hearing your plan." And honestly, not likely with that. She wasn't going to let a charge walk into a trap or a dangerous situation, and lose her. Not again. The guilt and sorrow started to bubble up, but it was pushed down again. She couldn't let past mistakes effect her focus now, but she also couldn't help but learn from them. She wouldn't let Star go be reckless on her own.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The word 'ransom' did very much perk up the attention of a few pirates. But where any civil city would hear a crime in the midst and call to the guards...It only seemed to embolden the pirates in the Salty Salmon. Chuckles resounded from a few of them. Beer steins clinked together. Hearing 'all the power, all the control' had the pirates donning wide smirks, and even managed to identify a few patrons who broke into grins over the words who were not wearing the same colours. Sympathizers? Undercover agents? It was hard to say. But one thing was certain: The bartender was horrified. Scared for his life as he shakily wiped clean a beer stein. A few clues that one might be able to use to discern that threats and violence had beaten this city into submission. It was, once again, another of Star's appeal to emotion. An attempt to make the pirates feel more secure. The way they had appealed to Ellesandra in the forest, the cocky, arrogant way with which they described their obviously illegal actions, making a mockery of Ellesandra's integrity by exerting force of their presence over those who dared to stand up to them was likely far more effective against those not clad in Ellesandra's knightly attire. Star listened to Ellesandra's request, and it caused Star to don a briefly...Complicated expression. She was studying them again. A bit of wetness then appeared in Star's eyes. Too hard for any but Ellesandra to see given the dim light. But it was there. The start of tears. But Star blinked them away, steadying herself. "Not here," she said, keeping a whisper. "Announce that you have to take me some place to secure the money. Make up something believable, and lucrative. Just something that can buy us time to get somewhere private. I can explain everything there where other ears aren't listening."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She took a deep breath, pushing down again on the irritation and concern. She shouldn't be letting those be so visible, even though to anyone but Star they didn't seem to be. Still, Star could seemingly read her face well enough to recognize that Ellesandra was getting more emotional about this than she should. At least, based on the expression Star had given her, Ellesandra assumed that. "Fine." The word came out harshly, as if she were angry at a young child being petulant. That emotion was actually behind it, but Ellesandra wasn't a half-bad actor. "If you insist on throwing your money away for this project, lets at least go and secure the coin so we can ensure it gets into the right hands and isn't pickpocketed on the street. It may not be MY gold, but I'll be damned if I let some two-bit pickpocket make off with it instead of securing our transaction. I know you don't like blood, so I'll warn you now any scoundrel who tries will have my sword through their palm and pinning it to their eye." Okay, that was grotesque, and Ellesandra would not do that. She was not quite so gruesome or ruthless, but pirates respected such threats, didn't they? While Ellesandra was okay with killing someone if she deemed it necessary in a situation, she would never go out of her way to make a scene of it or make it any more painful than it had to be. Well - with one scenario's exception, but she was NOT thinking about that. Stepping back, she looked through the tavern and motioned for Star to get up and lead the way out, keeping up her angry persona with a set jaw and furious eyes that dared anyone in the tavern to reach for either of them.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star lightly winced at the harsh, admonishing words. Her intent was never to upset Ellesandra, and seeing that she did so had clearly affected her. Ellesandra might hide all their pain and emotion as well as they could, but Star continued to do anything but, and took the insight of a five-year-old to determine what she was feeling in most moments. Was she capable of hiding her emotion? Perhaps. She had showed some subtlety when under duress when Ellesandra first happened upon her. And she clearly knew how to tie together a ruse. Was Ellesandra right to hold sincere doubts about Star? To hold back trust? She was hardly a simple woman to figure out. "Keep comfy here, Morrun. We'll come back to find you," she said to the elf. As she stood to join Ellesandra, the effects of the knight's words was clear on the tavern. Pirates specifically avoided making eye contact, chuckling to themselves as the threat hunger over the room. "Oooh, tough girl and her princess, eh?" came one muttering as the two passed by. "Ey, should let cap'n know to double the price. Girlie's got such nice clothes, she obviously can afford it," said another to his comrades. Laughs and chuckling was had at the expense of the two. Star ignored it all, as she presumed Ellesandra would, too. She kept an eye on them, however. Just watching them. Studying them, as she continued to be. Nobody dared reach for or try to stop the two, content to hide behind petty comments. If the two broke away, a some ten minute walk would see them able to reach the north edge of the city, and another five to rise up a lazy hill path to a forested edge, making it look for any onlookers that the two were well and truly departing to some other place to secure the coin. If all went well, she sought out a secure space concealed by the trees, an offshoot from the main path that led to a small pond that gave good concealment among the trees, then turned to Ellesandra to hear their concerns and answer their questions. Of course, if the knight's emotions got the better of them before then and a fight broke out, then Star would have some improvising to do.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had been acting in her anger for the most part, at least for the last bit there. She had been irritated at, and concerned for Star for putting herself in this situation, and there was anxiety in regards to whether this would turn out similarly to past situations like this. However, that anger ignited for real as soon as she'd begun to follow Star out and someone commented on them being a Knight and her Princess. It took every ounce of Ellesandra's willpower not to lash out. The anger and pain that comment had brought up wasn't something most people would be able to tell, of course. It flared in them, the ball of pain fueling the anger at such a comment, at how it cut much, much deeper than Ellesandra would ever admit out loud. Her left hand moved to rest on the rapier upon her right hip, casually threatening to draw it if needed, and squeezing tightly to the hilt in an attempt to keep it busy from just striking one of them on their way to the door. Getting out of the tavern was a breath of fresh air, even if they were still surrounded by potential enemies. Ellesandra didn't let her guard down even as they crested the hill, glancing down below them for a good view of if they had been followed at all. She scanned the area for a moment, taking that time to collect herself and bottle emotions tighter. Star was too similar to Ellesandra's past; as soon as this job was done she needed to move on or this would just keep coming up. Turning, she nodded to Star to begin her explanation.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Indeed, they had not been followed. Star hat noticed very swiftly the correlation between the comment and Ellesandra's anger. She saw it flare up around them like an inferno engulfing them. She held trust in them to keep it under wraps, but the final moments walking out of the tavern were...Tense. It showed on Star once they were in the clear. She was visibly concerned as she looked at Ellesandra. But, an explanation had to come first. She drew in a slow, steadying breath. She then closed her eyes. She extended an arm. A blue aura possessed her arm, slowly shifting around it with wispy lines of mana. Then, she slowly closed her hand into a fist. The aura, once a soft, sky blue, became a shimmering beacon of scintillating colours. A rainbow, kaleidoscopically shimmering with a trillion different colours. It covered from her fingertips to her shoulder. She was clearly concentrating on this. Her eyes opened, looking at Ellesandra. "...Strike my arm, Miss. Rhinelander. Hard as you can." She paused, smiling. "...Trust me."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
On the way, Ellesandra was too distracted with her emotions and keeping an eye out for any trouble to notice how Star was looking at her. On top of that, she had used the time spent getting to their location to help filter out her anger. It was still there when they stopped, but deep conscientious breathing had helped to reduce the intensity of it. When Star began summoning some sort of blue light, then a rainbow around her arm brought curiosity to the front. Was Star displaying some form of her ability to Ellesandra, as explanation for the plan? However, when she was asked to strike Star as hard as she can, she snorted. She didn't respond verbally, but she also had no plan to actually strike Star as hard as she could. She'd known this mage for what, three hours at this point, maybe less? She didn't trust Star yet; trust was not something Ellesandra gave easily. Reaching out, Ellesandra did strike Star's arm with an open palm, about as hard as a sibling might punch one another in a friendly jesting way. Not intended to really damage, but if whatever she was doing didn't block any of the impact it would be sore. That would be enough for her to identify what exactly was happening and how sturdy Star's magic might be. She did have to make an active effort not to draw Star's magic into herself when making contact with it, however. If this was supposed to be a test to how Star would hold up against the pirates, it would not do to use her own unique abilities on it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star remained still as Ellesandra struck her arm. Or rather, attempted to. Ellesandra instead struck something that felt solid as adamantine. Star's arm did not move in the slightest. If either of them would be sore, it would be the knight, but as much was unlikely given their less than enthusiastic strike. Star just smiled. "If that's as hard as you can hit, I will have to wonder who it was aided me against the pirates a few short hours ago," she said with a giggle. "...Your blade, much less those of the pirates, cannot harm me if I have time, mana, and focus enough to employ this strength of my gift. I encourage you to truly strike my arm, so you can hold confidence in more than my words that I will be safe." She kept her smile. "...I do keep asking you to trust me, but...I understand that that doubts I see in you will remain. I hope only that I can prove in time that I have aimed to be trustworthy at every step. You did save me, after all. I'd not wish to return to that initial scenario in which you found to me to test fate and see if my magic would have guided me from harm. I owe you at least my honesty for that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shouldn't have been surprised. She'd made the attack expecting magic to have somehow strengthened Star's arm, but it being as completely solid as it felt still made her raise an eyebrow. "To be fair, Miss Lumina." She said, frowning at the comment about the pirates. "I hardly struck the pirates with any strength. Three quick stabs was all that was needed, none of which required strength behind them." It was true; between them having been blinded and her own haste spell, which in hindsight wasn't necessary but Ellesandra hadn't known how inexperienced the pirates were at first, it had been simple to get past their guard and simply shove a sharp blade into fleshy skin. When invited to truly strike Lumina's arm though, she had shaken her head in refusal. "If I were to not hold back, Miss Lumina, I would absorb the magic effecting your arm, and strike through it. Or enchant my rapier to strike through." Why was she saying this? Because it got her away from the topic of Star risking herself for this woman. Not that Ellesandra thought the woman's life wasn't worth risking for, but STAR being the one to risk it wasn't what she wanted. "So, what is your plan then? To coat yourself in magic and simply walk in there, take her, and walk out?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a difficult smile at Ellesandra's words. On one hand, knowing they hardly even had to try made her feel a bit better that they hadn't been in danger. On the other, it made her wish the pirates would have seen sense all the more. Either way, she undid the magic on her arm, letting it disperse, then moved to the pond to cup some water her in her hand that she used to wipe the blood of her face, finally, before turning to her companion again. "I somehow doubt that is true, but I won't tempt fate by trying it if that is how it is," she said, clearly confident in her own abilities, but also wise enough to not let her desire to reassure Ellesandra take things to an extreme that might see her hurt. Apparently Star was capable of assessing risk after all. "Well, a little more than that. That part is just to ensure they can't hurt me. But if everything does go to plan, then I won't have to worry about anyone taking a swing at me in the first place." She realized she would need to justify those statements more, something she couldn't do in the meeting. She drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. "My magic is something called Auramancy. There have been some other magics by similar or identical names I've found in my travels, which I'm sure you can understand is frustrating. But mine, specifically, is concerned with the manipulation of auras, insofar as that applies to the energies that surround and permeate all living things. It's...Very difficult to make it all make sense in words. But with a little subtlety on my side, the hope is to sneak onto the ship with some discretion and use my powers to influence anyone on board into passivity. It's not very easy to do that if someone is already hostile, but...I am confident I can take a subtle approach that can avoid suspicion long enough to get to where Morrun's wife is being held. I know an arcane spell called Knock that will allow me to get her out of her cell, and once I have her, another spell called Dimension Door will carry us from the ship to the edge of the forest in an instant. That's why I was hoping you could be here, to ensure the landing space was safe. To ensure that we could have an expeditious getaway if there was an alarm. To...Deal with any pirates who swiftly ascended to challenge Morrun." Again, she seemed to have difficulty talking about the notion of killing, necessary as it might be. "A frontal assault is suicide, I know. But I can maintain my chromatic aura long enough to keep me safe if things go south, long enough to get me to his wife and out. It...does mean I imagine that sleeping at the inn no longer being an option is a foregone conclusion. But I am fine to sleep among the trees if it means saving an innocent woman. And I will know where she is held simply because I will be able to...See her distress." Well, that certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense at face value, now would it?

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned deeply at the explanation being provided. Even should Star be able to influence others that way, it was dangerous. And on that topic, was Star influencing her? Was that why her emotions were so reactive around Star? No, no Star had no idea about how her appearance and mannerisms effected her. Or how the Princess and Knight comment had effected her. At least, not WHY it had effected her. Ellesandra crossed her arms, eyeing Star for a moment. "That would explain your apparent empathy, I guess." If she could sense someone's aura, she could probably tell if someone was lying, couldn't she? It would probably make it particularly easy for her to be insightful, too. No wonder she'd been able to read Morrun like a book. Was that why she had kept looking at Ellesandra before? With a short nod, Ellesandra took a deep breath and let out a sigh. "Okay, I'll go meet up with Morrun and tell him we are going to get his gold, but want him to come meet us rather than carrying it into the city. I'm sure we'll have one or two people follow but the pirates probably won't assume he's ditching his wife. If any follow I'll take care of them." She glanced around at the woods, planning out where would be a good place to wait in trap, but continued talking while she did so. "Now, what is the plan if for some reason you can't get out? They have an anti-magic field or something?" She had to ask. Things happened, and she really didn't want to have to storm a ship to save Star due to lack of planning.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a soft smile. "I have been described as an empath before, yes. It's not a simple as just being able to know intrinsically if someone is lying to me, or if someone is holding out, or...Well, anything really. An aura is a complex thing. It's taken me a lifetime to be able to make as much sense of it as I can. My mother was leagues beyond my current capabilities, and is undoubtedly ever more so...If she still lives." Another sad smile. "As for the pirate ship, well...I would be able to tell rather swiftly if it was made of sussar bark, or if anti-magic was being used." A nuance to her power that Ellesandra might not yet understand, she surmised, so chose this moment to explain. She did say she owed them her honestly, after all. "You see I...The typical medium for my magic is sight. I see auras. I see emotion. Sometimes, that emotion carries memories. Sometimes, flickers of emotion linger like clouds that I can follow. Intense moments of the heart make the auras of those who experience them spike, and can leave remnants. I looked upon all the ships in port when we entered. I could see the auras of all the individuals on each of the ships, and lingering clouds on those which were abandoned. I would be able to feel the void of anti-magic if it was upon the ship as I approached and give me time and warning to leave earlier than expected. I will say I...don't expect them to have such things, but I admire your forward thinking." Another smile. "It...Means a lot to me that you are willing to support me in this. I already am the one who owes you, and yet you selflessly offer your aide yet again. I...Do not know how I will begin to repay you, but...Should you think of anything, I pledge to do all I can for all you've done and continue to do for me. Thank you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She SAW emotions? Was that why she kept looking at Ellesandra oddly? She hadn't been sure why, chocking it up to gratefulness, curiosity, or maybe even attraction, but seeing her emotions? Ellesandra was a very guarded individual with her emotions, she shared them with no one. The fact that Star could just slip past that guard and see them disturbed her. Not only that, but she thought about the strength of the emotions she'd been feeling in the past couple of hours. How Star reminded her of her Princess, and how that had thrown all of her guarded emotions everywhere. Typically she'd go weeks without letting herself feel them, but it seemed every other conversation with Star they were coming up based on the similarities. Had Star seen the memories associated with those emotions? Distrust sprung up in her and her jaw clenched, physically taking a step back from Star and clenching her fists. Ellesandra looked coiled, ready to spring into a fight or to escape at a moment's notice. She took every emotion she could currently feel and bundled it up, locking it in a box firmly and securely. She reined in every ounce of control she had to repress everything she was feeling, at least everything related to her past. She didn't answer the thanks at all, seemingly turning entirely business-focused. Reaching back into her pack, she slung it forward enough to pull out a hair tie and began pulling her hair up into a warrior's ponytail - how she typically wore it if she expected any chance at combat. "I'll ensure Morrun gets here." Her words were clipped, edging on harsh. There was anger in her tone, but it was being tightly controlled. "Should anything go wrong and you can't get here, make some sort of sign in the sky. I'll look out for it."

Star Lumina
Star was an insightful enough woman to know that what she was admitting might provoke a poor reaction. She wanted to be open an honest, but she knew honesty came with its pitfalls. It was curious that what flicked the switch was her being able to see them, rather than sense them. That was the admission that saw Ellesandra retreat into themselves, at least; Star had long gone beyond finding such things coincidental in her travels. People could wear masks. People could fight their emotions. But even Ellesandra's attempts to embrace the utmost stoicism would prove futile. Emotions were wild and untamed. Uncontrollable at their core. One could resist them. One needn't be ruled by them. But they still clung to the aura. Focusing one's mind on a task had some effect, but Ellesandra's guilt was so overbearing that force of will could not repress it. Not that it changed anything. Star had been seeing it for hours now. She similarly could see the anger, the distrust. That it wounded Star was obvious. Her bright, open, honest self being rejected by this woman who saved her did hurt, and the way her eyes grew heavy and drift to the ground between them made it clear. Ellesandra might fight to keep themselves stoic, but...Star was as easy and plain to read as ever. She said nothing in response. She simply nodded twice to the order, then silently walked past Ellesandra and began back towards the city, leaving the knight to take care of Morrun.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the distance grow between them. Saw the disappointment in Star's eyes and how she'd looked down to the ground. The hurt at Ellesandra's distrust and anger was evident. Why the fuck did she feel guilty over that? She reminded herself that Star had invaded her privacy, it was like reading a mind. Sure maybe Star didn't exactly have an option; Ellesandra didn't know if she could turn the sight off. But it still felt like she'd been betrayed, somehow. That Star had seen past things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone; that her defenses had failed her. Hell, it her defenses were probably all but useless in front of Star's magic. She needed to finish this job - even if she wasn't getting paid, it was a job - and then get away from Star. It was dangerous having someone who could see her emotions like that, emotions Ellesandra hadn't let herself process and had no desire to talk about. There was a moment where Ellesandra watched Star walk off, eyes scanning either side of the road to ensure that there wasn't any danger down Star's path. She waited until she could no longer see Star, to ensure she'd made it that far safely at least, before heading back towards the town herself. She made for a direct path with the tavern again, her real anger being used to glare down anyone who so much as looked her way with interest. Passing those who had catcalled them before, she gave them an icy stare that all but challenged them to try something or say something again. She wanted an outlet for her anger, even if she knew that was stupid, unnecessary, and wouldn't help. She wasn't some reckless boy who got angry and stormed through the town making it everyone else's problem. She was a disciplined, well trained knight and bodyguard. It didn't mean that temptation wasn't there, though. When she made it to the tavern, she did a quick sweep of the patrons again, making note of those who had obviously been part of the pirate group before and where they were located, and then searching for Morrun. Hopefully he hadn't gotten himself in trouble while they'd walked out to make plans.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The two had not been gone long at all. That, in itself, had a few raised eyebrows. Some...Expectant ones. From the catcallers to the tavern-dwellers, they weren't quite smart enough to pick up that something was wrong, but they sure did find it a tiny bit odd. Odd enough to think on it for a few seconds, then return to their steins of ale. It was surely someone else's problem to sort out. Morrun, meanwhile, had collected his things and looked like there was a spring sitting under his seat. The company this tavern provided gave him no delights, and he was eager to be rid of them. Star, meanwhile, moved through the city towards the docks. No signs of distress or alarm could be heard on the air, so, so far everything was going to plan. Morrun looked at Ellesandra with hope, eagerly awaiting instruction.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced once more at the pirates around the tavern, to ensure they weren't about to get up and make any moves or anything foolish. Once she was confident that they were staying out of the way, at least for now, she looked back to Morrun, who seemed over excited. "Come. I'm not foolish enough to carry that type of money into what could have been an elaborate ploy to rob us. You'll meet us and provide the service we are paying exorbitant fees for, and then you can take that money back for this ransom." She dropped her voice, still loud enough for most in the tavern to hear but playing it off as if she were grumbling to herself and it wasn't intended for others to hear. "My Lady apparently has deeper pockets than she does sense." Ellesandra was trying to play up that she knew this was a stupid thing to pay for, and more money than appropriate. That would be suspicious to the pirates, certainly. But if she were playing it as if her employer was simply a bleeding heart rich noble who didn't care about the cost. It would potentially place a target on Star's back later, but if things went according to plan Star wouldn't be here long enough for that to matter. She stepped to the side and motioned Morrun towards the door, not letting him follow behind or anything. "I'll lead you up to where we're camped currently. You'll get to see the gold, but you are not to touch it until you've provided her the service. Understood?"


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Y-Yes, understood, understood!" said Morrun, eagerly jumping up. The pirates had a few laughs at his expense, which he scowled at, but rose above and moved forward to walk towards the entrance. One of the pirates then also stood. One wearing a long black coat. Scimitar was in its sheath, but the handle clearly visible. The man bore a scar over one green eye and had a red bandana over his hair, and was clean shaven unlike most of the others. "I think I'll join you," the man brazenly said. "See about where you're camped. Can't risk our ah...Legitimate business transaction going and walking away from us now can we?" Suspicion hadn't been breached yet, but this man, of seemingly higher rank, but discernibly not the captain of this crew, saw fit to throw his weight around a little. They had clearly operated with impunity thus far, and the brazen confidence that made the other pirates sloppy fighters similarly was making this man - presumably a first mate - feel bold enough to invite himself along for the walk. "Come on lads, two of ya get off your plump asses and take a walk, could use it to sober up a little and get back to work when we get back, eh? Captain's gonna want to haul ass outta 'ere once we have ourselves a little spending spree at the conclusion of this transaction." At his remarks, two of the other pirates rose off their stools, cursing under their breath and just slightly unsteady in their gait, to join the first mate. The first mate then motioned to the door for Ellesandra, wearing the most smug grin he possibly could.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked back towards the pirate, obviously someone of more influence than the base crew, and a frown creased her face. Her eyes narrowed and she looked the man up and down. "You expect me to let you come near my Lady, armed, while she has gold prepared for a transaction? Criminals of your level do not respect honor, so don't give me your word or anything." Her left hand moved over to rest on the hilt of her rapier on her hip. It was a subtle threat, but not one that she was actively making. "If you must come, you will wait back from the camp. You may be within eyesight, but I will not tolerate you approaching." Ellesandra was calling upon every bit of her knightly confidence and authority. She wasn't tall by any means; likely most of those in the tavern would stand much taller than her 5'1 height. However, she had the presence of someone much bigger than she actually was, a confidence of a trained soldier and one that would not be afraid to fight her way out of something. She was drawing what would be considered a normally appropriate boundary for the safety of her Lady, without outright refusing the Pirate. Hopefully, the pirate wouldn't let his confidence push past that.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirate placed his hands on his hips and smirked. "Or wha? You gonna prick me with your needle, pipsqueak? Oughta be a wench servin' up ale in 'ere rather than tryin' t' lay down the law," he said, then nudged his pirate mate with his elbow. "Ey, get a load o' 'iss lass, tryna' tell us how it is, eyy?" he said, sharing a chuckle with his mates as they collectively bathed in their misogyny they found so hilarious. "Pff, whatever you say, 'muh lady'," he said in as mocking a tone as he could. "We won't trample on your pretty posies, just make quick of it, yeah? Any funny business and I'm sure the captain won't have any qualms tripling the er, ah...Protection fee we're charging." His arms crossed over his chest here, sporting a smug stance as he towered over the shorter knight by an entire foot. He wasn't nice about it, but it seemed Ellesandra's demands were being heeded. A need to enforce his pride and power in front of his mates balanced by...Perhaps a desire to not upset the captain by screwing things up, and thus, the concession was given. "Lead on, proud knight, to your little fairy garden with all its shiny little coins, yeah?"


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra ignored the misogyny. All that mattered to her was that he'd agreed to it. The threat about tripling the protection fee was ignored, since they weren't actually going to be paying it anyways. Ellesandra considered encouraging him to go first, rather than turning her back to him and walking through. She didn't want to, but she didn't think he'd go along with that if she demanded it. "As you wish. Unfortunately, my Lady has gold, but not the necessary remove curse spells to fix whatever is going on with your face, if that's what you're hoping to find." With a smirk, she stood to the side as she opened the door, then closed it behind her as she stepped through. He might stop the door from closing, but by then she'd have stepped out, to the side and where she could keep an eye on him while walking forward. There was no attempt to stop him, or the others he'd brought with him, from following. Instead, she motioned for Morrun to continue forward and eyeing the pirates and, as long as they didn't start a fight, would begin leading them out towards the forest where she'd chatted with Star.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The man didn't find the joke funny. It was risky. Getting the jab in nearly had the man luging in response. One of his mates was stepping forward, only to have the first mate plant his hand on the lesser pirate's chest. "Easy lad. We get the money first, then we can show the lil' pipsqueak here what a cursed face looks like. See how inspiring she is in that armor with that ugly mug cut to ribbons, yeah?" he said, quietly to his mate, but loud enough to ensure Ellesandra heard him. Assuming that didn't set the knight off in turn, the men followed. When exiting, Ellesandra would be able to see Star - her dress didn't exactly make her subtle - as she was boarding the ship. Seemed she got past anyone on the docks without a hitch. Some pirates approached Star when she boarded. It was too far to hear anything or make out details, but whatever it was that was said seemed good enough for the deck hands who let her pass. She then disappeared to the bowels of the ship while one of the deck hands made their way to what could be presumed to be the captain's quarters. The first mate and his merry band of drunkards were right behind Ellesandra and Morrun, who at this point looked stressed enough to have a heart attack right in front of the knight. His pack was on his back, and he walked with rigidity to his gait. The group would be able to make it to wherever Ellesandra led them, however there would be some expectation of results once the group arrived from the three pirates.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond to the threat. She shouldn't have made the jab, in all honesty, but there was something about how he'd insulted Star that was still bothering her. When Ellesandra noticed Star getting aboard the pirate ship, she made sure not to watch the ship directly. No, she kept an eye out of her peripheral vision to ensure Star got on without difficulty, but otherwise pointed up towards where they were going to ensure the pirate's attention was on her and their destination, no straying eyes back to potentially see what Star was doing. "We've made camp just over the ridge up there, into the forest. That's our destination." She made her way, not looking at the pirates at all other than keeping them within sight to ensure they didn't try to backstab her or anything. When the crested the ridge and looked into the woods, Ellesandra touched Morrun's arm and motioned to a copse of trees. "We're camped just past those trees. Why don't you go speak with her and start whatever magical detection you're doing while I have a chat with our friends here?" She wanted to ensure morrun was at least a few steps away before any fighting began. She had also been sure to place herself between Morrun and the men when she said this. If they tried to reach for him, they'd have to reach past her first - which even if they thought she was a weak woman would be stupid to do. Her gaze cut to the pirates with a firm look. "As I said before, i don't trust them near my Lady."


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirates seemed more or less indifferent to the goings-on, eager only to get their payday, and not do anything that would mess it up. So, despite some mocking smirks from the first mate, he was content to stuff his hands in his pockets and whistle to himself, rising up to his tip toes and falling back down again. Morrun of course heeded Ellesandra's words and moved away into the forest. Obviously, not finding Star, he understood what was happening and made sure to stay out of sight somewhere nearby. He was ready to start chanting magical nonsense to fool the pirates if needed, but he hoped to simply remain out of sight. Then it was just...A waiting game. The pirates were passive, but expectant. They wouldn't wait forever. And they certainly would know something was up the moment Star showed up, since Star was apparently over with Morrun doing weird magic stuff while Ellesandra stood guard. Star was certainly hard at work...And no signal in the sky just yet. So it was Ellesandra's moment to either bide their time, or make a move.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had no intention of waiting for Star. She wanted these pirates dealt with both in case Star did signal that Ellesandra was needed, and before Star returned so that she wouldn't be in danger during the fight. Ellesandra waited, back to the brushes and facing the pirates passively for a few moments, giving Morrun plenty of time to head in and find somewhere to hide, away from danger. She gave herself to a silent count of thirty before she withdrew her rapier. "You have the option of returning to town now and keeping your lives, or fighting and dying. Your choice." She was sure her drawing her rapier had put them on edge, but she hadn't attacked; not at first. She held the rapier in front of her, right foot going back and sinking down into a proper fighting stance. She didn't use magic, based on how unskilled the previous pirates had been. The two drunk ones she wasn't worried about at all; the more authoritative one might possess some skill, but she wasn't dropping her guard. She could always add magic if needed later.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The moment Ellesandra reached for her rapier, the first mate drew his sword. He had clearly been just as ready for a fight, though that message didn't make it to his two lightly inebriated comrades. They had a few seconds before they joined in the fight as well. The two circled around either of Ellesandra's flanks, leaving them surrounded. A familiar fighting position. "...Way I sees it, there's three of us and one of you," began the first mate. "So I thank 'ye, for giving me the chance I was itchin' for to pay you back for all that holier-than-thou bullshit you carried in on your boots the moment you set foot in our turf," he said, venom dripping from his words. Not that it was any surprise, but they weren't going to pull punches now that they had been given reason to fight. And if Ellesandra hadn't already started the fight, the three of them rushed in all at once, coordinating their attack to all strike from different angles at, more or less, the same time, aiming to chop at any part of Ellesandra not covered by armor.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"I guess I'll do to you what I did to your friends out on the road, then." She had timed the comment specifically to potentially throw them off when they planned to attack, but whether or not it worked she didn't wait to see. As they all began to attack, she quickly pivoted towards one of the drunkards the movement itself dodged two blades, and her own moved up to knock the other away. She went for the same killing blow she'd had on the others, a slice into the throat and pull out. Ellesandras movements were fluid, not stopping whether or not she'd hit. She'd used the movement to create distance between herself and the others, ducking from where she'd been surrounded into where she could face them all, and quickly stepping into the other drunkard with an attempt to do the same to him. They were the easy targets, and she could use fancy footwork to avoid the only sober one of them until his two companions were taken care of. That was her plan, anyways.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The footwork of the knight was far and above the three pirates. The two lackeys had no chance. Their swings were filled with arrogance and confidence, even in the wake of the comment about Ellesandra felling two others. The first ate Ellesandra's rapier in the neck, paralyzed by the attack as he was left to bleed out once the rapier was withdrawn. The distance was too short, however, for the action to keep Ellesandra out of harm's way. The other lackey's sword went wide, but the first mate had clearly seen his share of sorties. Enough that the strike to his underling presented him an opportunity to swing horizontal across Ellesandra's thighs. The metal bit into flesh. Shallow wounds, not enough to impede Ellesandra, but torn fabric and the first droplets of crimson from the knight at the hands of these criminals was spilled. His follow up was to backhand his own other, living lackey, which saved the man's neck from the thrust of the rapier by inches as he reeled back just before Ellesandra could thrust. He might be a criminal, but he clearly had some sense, even if it came with callousness towards his men. He didn't seem fazed that the other died. With the initial engagement sorted, Ellesandra then found the remaining two pirates staring her down. Hesitation, and fear rose in the first mate, as if surprised the knight was...Exactly who they claimed to be. But rather than charge in head on again, the first mate produced a glass bottle of some sort filled with crackling energy and swiftly hurled it at Ellesandra's feet. The bottle shattered on impact, exploding into a cloud of thick smoke that obscured the battlefield. The smoke stung at Ellesandra's eyes and throat, but a knight like her would find the crude trick was not up to the staunch fortitude she possessed. Some coughing and watering eyes aside, it wouldn't be able to daze her as the pirates expected it might; however, it did still obscure vision, and thus needed reliance on sound. The charges were staggered; the lackey first, with the first mate a few steps behind. Given his previous attack, it seemed he might be counting on Ellesandra to attack the first available target, then use the chance to run them through, which is precisely what they would attempt to do if Ellesandra played their game. Of course, the obscuring smoke went both ways. So there was no guarantee Ellesandra was even where they expected her to be in the seconds between the smoke engulfing the battlefield and the charge starting.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had let out a silent curse at feeling the blade slice at her thighs. Perhaps she should have gone ahead and used magic to ensure easy victory. Still, they didn't really enjoy the idea of the lethargy that hit them after using their haste spell, and their other magic was more focused against magic users. Ellesandra was frowning as she faced the remaining two pirates, a little impressed with the first mate slapping his companion out of the way of her strike. Well, that just meant she wouldn't be able to go for the quick, easy death for them then. As the man slammed the bottle onto the ground and smoke pillowed out, Ellesandra quickly backpeddled. No use standing in smoke that was stinging at her eyes and throat, though she did her best to remain silent while doing so and to take careful steps back so she didn't fall backwards. As such, she was not where they believed her to be when attacking. In fact, she had begun circling around, looking for movement as she did so, making her way around where the smoke was billowing. It would start spreading out soon, allowing visibility again, but when it did Ellesandra was standing on the other side of where she had been before. Her free hand was up, partially covering her mouth and nose to filter any of the smoke a little more, and as soon as she could see one of them well enough to strike, she did. The goal was to strike before they got their whereabouts back, whichever one she struck, and this time she was aiming straight at the person's chest.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a calm that fell over the battlefield as Ellesandra retreated and circled the smoke plume. Their attempts to be stealthy were hampered by the heavy armor they wore; the clacking of the metal even when moving slowly made enough noise against the dead quiet of the forest to keep a vague location in mind. From within the smoke, there was nothing at first. Then... "Wh-- Hey! What are you doing ya maddie-- WHOAAAA!" From within the smoke cloud, the lower ranking pirate sailed through the air at Ellesandra, having been thrown at her with quite an impressive toss that had the lackey sailing like a cannonball at the knight. As unconventional as strategies came, and an absolute epitome of pirate tactics. No honour among thieves, and no care for each other's lives either it seemed. But the opening provided was slim, so whether Ellesandra took the bait and killed the man in flight, only to be braced or toppled by the impact, or rolled out of the way, the first mate was right behind, ready to stab clear through his ally to get at the knight, or take advantage of her lowered guard to thrust at whatever space he could see that wasn't armored.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't forgotten the noise she made, but when there was movement and confusion in the smoke, she had been hoping the noise wasn't easy to follow. Still, she had NOT expected one of the pirates to be THROWN at her. She did not take the easy stab it provided, instead dodging to the side, which allowed her to see the first mate coming in behind his companion who had been thrown at her. She stepped up towards him while his companion sailed past to her right, feinting a stab towards his neck like he would expect her to take. She kept her guard up, planning to either reach forward and grab him if he tried to move out of the way, or to quickly stab lower if he moved his blade up to block it.

Star Lumina
Indeed, the lackey sailed past, rolling around as he hit the ground. The first mate reacted, seeing the knight rolled out of the way. Arrogance once more proved to be the man's downfall, however, as he expected to still have the upper hand. By the time Ellesandra had readied their attack, the first mate had already jumped into the air and was ready to descend upon her with a stab at her neck. But in the contest of knight vs first mate, his attack would prove the more easily dodged. A swift adjustment to the side is all Ellesandra would need to do to avoid his thrust, and all she had to do otherwise was hold her rapier out for the man to skewer himself upon.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked up upon the first mate swinging towards her. His attack was extremely choreographed, easily read. She slid beneath his attack, right hand out to catch him and rapier tilted up so that as he fell, he would fall upon her blade. She caught him as he skewered himself, hand gripping onto his chest and shoving him backwards just as soon as he landed upon her sword to avoid him trying to go for any suicidal attacks either. Ellesandra stayed mobile, quickly hopping backwards after shoving him off of her blade, and glancing between him and the pirate he had thrown for any signs of movement or hostility remaining. The sting of the cuts on her thighs increased a little at this movement, but in the adrenaline of a fight it was at the very back of her mind.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra would find the other pirate had worked his way up to his feet, stumbling. The first mate wheezed and coughed up blood as one lung filled with blood where he had been punctured. He would die in the next minute or so. The other pirate, realizing he had been all but sacrificed by his crew, and seeing two of said crew laying dead on the floor, saw no reason to swear fealty to this band of pirates any longer. He kept his weapon on him, but as Ellesandra was throwing the first mate to the ground, he was hurriedly running away into the forest, away from Cloverport, through the trees to the west. She could run after him, and likely catch him with ease. But there was no immediate threat to the plan as he ran. All his allies were back to the south, and if he intended on circling around, it would likely be too little, too late. It was about this time, as well, that a surge of mana appeared in the form of a bright blue archway that opened with crackling energy. Through it, Star and an elven woman shot forward, with a flash of light streaking from the port city to the magical doorway that saw the two of them briefly encased in bright white light before they landed, sure on their feet. Star was fully surrounded by that brilliant, rainbow energy. The sort she said would only be needed if she was in danger, as it would stop any blades from hurting her. So it seemed, not everything went perfectly to plan, and there was cause enough to defend herself. She was, thankfully, in one piece. But she also looked out of breath; doubtlessly, she was pushing herself to the limits of her mana. The radiant, rainbow energy dissipated off her, returning her to her natural state, and she then doubled over, braced on her knees, to catch her breath.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched as the other pirate ran off. She only watched for a few moments, keeping an eye on the direction he was going as well as if he was making any motion to come back and surprise her. Meanwhile she turned her gaze down to the first mate, reaching forward and pushing her rapier through his throat to make his death quicker and easier. No need to have him sputtering on the ground from gut wound; those were never fun. When the magical portal appeared Ellesandra's head snapped up, going into another fighting stance with a brief wince at the cut the pirate had gotten on the back of her thighs. It was apparent that the people coming through it were not pirates though, and after watching to ensure they hadn't been followed or anything, she straightened and leaned down, cleaning the blood off her blade with the pirates shirt. "Your Husband is back in the woods there." She pointed in the direction for the woman that Ellesandra assumed was his wife, sheathing her sword while straightening and looking back to the ladies. There was concern that shot up when seeing Star doubled over breathing heavily, but she didn't approach. There was also a little bit of shame at having let one of the pirates wound her, even if it had been a minor wound, and distrust was still apparent in regards to Star's ability to simply see past her emotional guards. Ellesandra reached for her pack, pulling out the necessary bandages and clothes to begin treating her own wounds. "Were either of you hurt?"

The elven woman was wearing a matching wedding band to her husband, along with an emerald engagement ring to pair with it. She had similar complexion to him and soft black hair that made her bright green eyes stand out against her freckled face. "T-Thank you! Thank you!" she said, on the edge of tears. Red markings adorned the elven woman's wrists in the shape of manacles, and similar red marks from what was likely rope or cloth were on her cheeks in line with her mouth. That she attempted to break free from her captivity was as obvious as the mistreatment she endured. The woman ran in the direction noted, and the two could be heard speaking after a few moments as they came together, inaudible from the distance. Star looked at Ellesandra with concern upon noticing their wounds. Her arms were trembling as she strained to keep herself stable, with sweat visible on her brow. Quite a bit of strain she endured, it seemed. "N-No, the...Captain...Came after me. Definitely tried to kill me, but I was ready for it," she said, offering as reassuring a smile as she could given her fatigue. "I can only assume he will be riling up the pirates left in the city, so we should be...Anywhere that isn't here right now. I'm sorry." She willed herself up to her feet and began to walk, still clearly short of breath. If Star's intuition was correct, the group would have a limited time frame to escape before the wide search party began to track them down. Long enough that they needn't set off sprinting...But not long enough for anyone to truly relax and prepare for the road ahead.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond to the elven woman, letting her go off and reconnect with her husband for a moment. She took that moment to pull out a small flask of alcohol and pour on the cuts she gained, clenching her teeth at the burning feeling, and then quickly beginning to wrap them up and bandage them. They weren't deep or bad enough to need more than that, a simple disinfect and wrap up to help them clot and stop bleeding. When she was done, she straightened up entirely again from the awkward position she'd been leaning to reach her own thighs, looking Star up and down to confirm she was telling the truth in regards to being fine. Nodding to confirm she at least didn't seem injured, just fatigued, Ellesandra walked up and offered her arm, in case Star was so fatigued she needed the support. "You're right. Plus, one of the pirates who followed us here ran off. I don't know that he'll go back and tell his men, but there's a possibility, which means we'll have less time than we thought. Should get your contact and his wife ready to go." Ellesandra wasn't unused to needing to move quickly, especially after a skirmish. She did glance behind her briefly at the town to see if anyone had seen them or were moving directly towards them, but beyond keeping an eye out she was just focused on getting them moving away. Pirates likely didn't have much experience tracking over land, at least she hoped they didn't, and she had plenty of experience disguising tracks. She just needed to get further away from the city to make it worth it.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked at Ellesandra's arm. There was an unexpected moment of...Decision in that. As if there was more to grabbing the offered arm than precisely just that. A flash of pain, or perhaps guilt, came over Star's face. She gave the most polite declining gesture she could, offering a smile along with the raised palm to try and assure them that she was okay. She was unsteady as she began moving to do as asked, so it might seem a peculiar decision to decline the help. Regardless, she moved to the husband and wife. "I'm sorry, both of you, but we had best be clear of this place. We should be going now, and we can talk when we're safe." Her words were not alarmist, just stating the matter at hand. The two nodded. "R-Right," began Morrun. "The elvish settlement I'm from isn't terribly far. A day's walk north-west along the main roads, we could arrive by midnight if we take the forest path," he explained, looking to Star and Ellesandra for a decision on the matter. It seemed simple, but Star still looked at Ellesandra. Obviously the knight couldn't stay here, and finding their way to a new place with a warm bed and armed guards to deter any pirates would be safest. But she also couldn't rule out the fact that Ellesandra might be feeling pushed at this point. First it was saving Star, then just to the city, then roped into helping these two...Star didn't hold judgement in her eyes, and could hardly blame them if they wanted to take this chance to walk their own path.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned when Star refused her help, but then proceeded to walk unsteadily towards the couple. She considered reaching out and taking her arm forcefully to help, but held back from doing so. Star was a grown ass woman and if she decided she didn't want help, Ellesandra was not going to push it on her. She followed behind, glancing towards the Morrun when he confirmed there was an elvish settlement not far from here. The look from Star was ignored; while Ellesandra technically had a choice, she really didn't. She wasn't going to leave these three to go find their own way. "Do the pirates know about this settlement? If they do, they may be expecting you to go that way and already be looking or tracking in that area. We may want to take a roundabout path to avoid such, but if you don't think they know, straight path there is likely the quickest and safest. I can follow a bit behind and throw the trail off." She'd learned in her training how to create false tracks and hide real ones. It was important, knowing how to throw a pursuer or kidnapper off the trail. She'd be a bit behind them so they were more exposed if they did get attacked while she was doing it, but if they waited until they were a safe enough distance away from the town they could cut down on the risk of that happening pretty substantially.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"It's not on any maps, and it is guiled in illusory magic. I doubt they know. It's not...Impossible, but I'd never assume a meat-headed pirate would be capable of finding such a place. But even if they did, the hunters of Lea'taas would see arrows in their eyes long before they reached the walls. It will be safe there, I promise," he said, a look of genuine appreciation on his face. There were few in the world who would be so kind as to do what Star and Ellesandra did, fewer still who would do so after discovering that Morrun's initial intent was to deceive the pair of them into paying an extortionary amount of money for information that was nowhere near worth the amount asked. The gratitude of he and his wife was clear. There was no trace of dishonesty to be found. Star, as well, in all her insight and power, did not signal that she saw anything but honesty in the man. "Besides. We are ahead of them now, and can remain so if we leave immediately. They were all in Cloverport. I heard talk of them sailing out within the week for another city further down the coast. They won't be roaming these wilds; there's nothing of value to thieves like them to be found for miles." Aside from the elven settlement, of course, but as established it was extremely unlikely the pirates even knew that existed unless told about it. With all said, Star nodded to Ellesandra's words. "I'll take the lead with Morrun, then, in case danger comes from the front," said Star, still winded, and taking much longer than one might expect to catch her breath. "I-I...I'll alert you of any danger while y-you...You cover our tracks. But we should...Should move." Still breathing heavily, Star gestured for Morrun to take the lead, following him with his wife keeping close behind the two. Star watched over her shoulder at Ellesandra. Partly just to ensure they were coming, but also just...More of that curious gaze of hers, this time paired with a somewhat worried look in her eyes.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded to what Morrun said. That was enough to convince her heading straight there was the right move. When Star suggested she'd take the lead in case they were attacked from the front, however, Ellesandra frowned. Their gaze raked over Star once again, searching for a wound. Was she simply that winded from keeping her magical armor up and then doing the portal? That would be understandable, especially considering the light magic she'd done just earlier, but that also meant she was probably on her last leg stamina wise. Fighting anyone who came from the front wouldn't be ideal for her. The concern was evident, even without Star being able to see the emotion itself. The concern was directly tethered to the guilt and sorrow, a fear creeping out that the past would be repeated. Ellesandra almost said something, to stop them while she covered tracks, but she held back. She was being ridiculous. She followed behind them for a bit, not immediately parting ways to hide their tracks. The thing was, if the pirates found their initial tracks that would be good; plus they couldn't exactly hide the blood and bodies of the other pirates easily. And if the one who escaped said anything, trying to hide their tracks on that ridge was pointless. No, they needed to start off in their actual direction for a bit, and only after doing so would Ellesandra drop back silently and without comment to begin covering where their tracks actually went, and redirecting them to the road that they had originally come from and where Ellesandra had encountered Star and the pirates originally. She took a branch and swept the dirt and ground to cover where they had walked, then walked in another direction, making multiple sets of tracks using different weight in each step so unless someone really looked closely they wouldn't notice it was the same person.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Whether Ellesandra's methods would be useful at deterring any followers would remain unknown for the immediate future. The only way to know for sure that the deception succeeded was to never hear from the pirates again. A favourable outcome, but there would certainly be that lingering uncertainty that they might harbour a vendetta. It was equally likely they would get drunk, throw up, and forget this ever happened. Time would tell. For now, the forward march began. Star hadn't seemed injured when looking at her. There was blood on her dress, but that was the same blood as what was on her dress from before their rescue mission. The blood from her cheek. Just small dots on the otherwise pristine silks. The concern on Ellesandra's face made Star smile in response. To reassure, or genuinely because she felt happy to know Ellesandra was concerned for her? Difficult to say, but a smile she maintained. "Are you sure you can keep walking? Do you need to stop and rest?" asked Morrun to Star. She shook her head. "Nnh, I can press onward. We can rest when we're safe," came her reply. Despite this, Morrun still offered her his waterskin, which she did accept. Her arms shook slightly when drinking the water, but she clearly needed it from how much she drank from it. Time would pass. Hours of walking, interrupted by short rests now and then. Star did eventually catch her breath in this time, and there was little to do beyond walk the road and the forested path they eventually moved into with an eye for any dangers. Wild animals could be seen, but the prey animals ran and if there were any predator animals? They certainly stayed out of sight. It was a welcome reprieve from the dangers of Cloverport for Star, but despite the rests, despite the water, despite the time...She still had clear exhaustion in her gait. She kept up, but Ellesandra was certainly correct that she was in no shape to fight. She was barely in shape to walk.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The smile did little to reassure Ellesandra that Star was actually okay. She'd seen plenty of people smile through pushing themselves too hard. When Ellesandra rejoined them, her eyes once again scanned Star up and down to see how she was holding up before focusing on their surroundings to look out for a trap or sign anyone had caught up with them. The water was a good thing to be offered to Star, and she had nodded to Morrun in thanks when he had done so. As she stepped up to walk alongside the group, she looked over to the Elven woman, obviously injured. "Will these scouts from the elven encampment have any issue with Miss Lumina or my presence? And Miss-" This time, it was directed at Morrun's wife. "Do you have any injuries they gave you that need treated right now? It would be pointless to get there if you were hiding an infected whip cut or anything that's going to hurt more to wait." She was relatively confident that she'd bought them a little bit of time with her tracks, assuming they were even following them. That wasn't guaranteed, but it was a strong possibility depending on how upset the captain had been. Now, it was just a matter of if they unluckily stumbled across any on the road, like Star had previously.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"A-Ah, I'm Lissana. Lissana Dayflower," said the elven woman, her voice meek but pleasant. "A-And, n-no, just..." she looked at her wrists. "The restraints. Maybe some bruising from when they threw me around," she said, gratitude in her eyes for Ellesandra's concern. "Some of the pirates were making...You know...C-Comments...A-About d-doing..." She cut herself off, one hand grabbing the other arm. A look of fear washed over her; blood drained from her face. "...I-It's good you showed up when you did, let's say," she said, clearly eager to conclude the matter. No tears were visible on her clothing from flogging or similar. Morrun naturally looked plenty disgusted upon hearing his wife recount such things, but he paused in his stride to let her move beside him so he could loop an arm around his beloved. "You're safe now," Morrun said to his wife, earning a nod. Then, another appreciative smile to Ellesandra. It was because of the knight and the mystic that he could say that with confidence, of course. Star didn't interject, but she looked over her shoulder at the exchange. First with sympathetic sorrow at Lissana, obviously holding nothing but dread at what might have been. But then a calm comfort, knowing they were okay. Battered, surely. Scared? Undoubtedly. But the worst was avoided. She could take comfort in having acted without hesitation and preventing tragedy. Though it seemed at this point she was pushing herself too hard; one leg gave out as she stepped, causing her to drop to one knee. She caught herself on her hands planting on the soft earth, then remained in this position for a moment, lightly trembling as she slowly, steadily tried to work back up to her feet.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Anger flashed through Ellesandra at Lissana's words. Her jaw clenched, but she forcibly relaxed it so that she didn't intimidate the elven woman. Rather than saying anything else, she let Morrun move in to comfort her. Best to come from her husband than some strange armored woman, anyways. She heard a shuffle up front and quickly looked back that way to see Star having fallen to one knee. Without a second of hesitation, Ellesandra jaunted forward quickly, ignoring the sting of pain coming from her own wound at the quick and sudden movement. In just a moment she'd found herself leaning over Star, reaching forward and placing a hand on Star's back to ensure she at least had support there. Her other hand was offered to Star to help her back up, a mixture of concern for Star's stamina and irritation at her pushing herself and refusing help coming up. It also pinged some of the grief, a reminder of someone else, but only Star would be able to see that with her ~Special Eyes~. "If you refuse help again, Miss Lumina, you only get one more chance. If you fall again, I will throw you over my shoulder and haul you the rest of the way back." The threat was made with absolute intention. It was a promise more than anything else, an acknowledgment that Star was setting a boundary about not wanting help and that Ellesandra would respect that for now, but if it happened again that boundary wouldn't matter.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The moment Ellesandra placed their hand on Star's back, the reason for her refusal to take Ellesandra's arm prior would come into much greater context. The physical touch evoked a connection. A spark of something that flowed up Ellesandra's arm. Like a wave of serene, beautiful water, it cascaded over Ellesandra's figure, bathing them in calm. In serenity. Inner peace. Of course, this came at odds with Ellesandra's own turmoil. It was not something that controlled or overrode Ellesandra's own emotion. It was simply...Comfort. Like a final exhale after hours-long frustration. Like finally being able to sit after marching for a week straight. It was...Soothing. And with that soothing feeling came an innate understanding. A recognition of the source. It was Star. Her aura touched Ellesandra when they touched her. It was not an unpleasant feeling. Quite the opposite in fact. But whether Ellesandra's hand lingered or removed swiftly would determine what followed. In the instant, at least, Star looked over her shoulder from her lowered position, up at Ellesandra, with worry in her eyes. Worry that she'd see the same closure, the same walls rising, the same...Distance from Ellesandra she saw before, as if Star was ashamed of her powers in the company of the knight.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra seemed to jump at the feeling of calm that poured through the touch. Her jaw clenched and she all but flinched away at first, finally understanding why Star had refused. There was another spike of irritation, but also...acceptance. Ellesandra wasn't going to let Star stumble the rest of the way. There was obvious displeasure, even just on her face, but she reached forward ant took Star's arm, ignoring the calm that came through the touch and working to pull Star into a standing position again. She maintained contact, her arm moving to wrap around Star's back and hold onto her, ensuring that Star could put the majority of her weight on Ellesandra if she needed it. If not, Ellesandra would simply help her balance as she walked. There were no words; she didn't need to say how uncomfortable she was with how Star's power was influencing her emotions. Even with the calming effect, her distrust and displeasure with it seemed to rise at first. Of course, if Star allowed longer contact that would go away, not enough to truly fight against any constant flow of calm, but for now - there was no way Star would miss that Ellesandra wasn't happy, but willing, to maintain contact here.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star didn't, couldn't resist the hold on her arm the helped her up. She desperately needed it. Her weight instinctively leaned upon Ellesandra, clinging to them for support. The sustained hold did bring with it more; the longer the hold remained, the more Ellesandra would be able to feel what Star felt. Star of course was able to see what Ellesandra felt. But the touch seemed to bridge that connection further, to some degree. It wasn't as intense - not that Ellesandra could know - with this passive touch. But Ellesandra would be able to feel Star's exhaustion. Not as their own. But an innate understanding of what Star felt. A knowing that one couldn't put into words. How every step was labourous. How pain shot up her legs with each footfall. Star had pushed herself beyond her limits, as much was obvious. It had physical ramifications. Things she was clearly able to push past...To some degree. That she hadn't been wincing or whining in pain was a miracle; her control over her own emotions was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite significant. But she could not overcome the limits of her body, try as she might. Gratitude welled in her heart for Ellesandra, and Ellesandra could feel it intrinsically. The feelings did not pass onto the knight from within, nor did they require any effort to keep separated from their own emotion. The knight's guilt, their irritation, all of their own emotions remained as their own. And if the knight truly wanted, they would have no issues resisting the bond. Rejecting the sensations that flowed into them. Denying it all from influencing them would be trivial. It was not an invasive feeling. It was simply a calm, affectionate zephyr blowing through a window into Ellesandra's soul; the window would take no effort to close, even if the sensation was novel. Among the other things Star felt, if Ellesandra chose to open their heart and accept them, was...Guilt. Sadness. Loneliness. Longing. Determination. Some happiness, though it was coiled in a tumultuous storm of nuance and more complex feelings. All of this, without a lifetime of experience to decipher it, would be...Troublesome to make much sense of. To follow the threads of emotion and find their roots. The why for any given emotion was a mystery. But that the emotion was there was plain as day. And deeper, beyond this surface acknowledgement and understanding of emotion, was something more. A bridge that could be crossed. A lingering connection left separated. Ellesandra could reach out to it if they sought deeper understanding...But it begged the question whether that would be a two way street. Regardless of all that happened unseen to the two elven lovers, Star managed a much more steady stride while being supported by Ellesandra. Now that it had been forced upon her, she seemed to take it wholly, and completely. A suggestion that she wanted to take it all along...But the fear that she felt was still there. The worry. The shame. And as clear as it was written on her face, Ellesandra wouldn't even need to look at her to understand these things in the moment, so long as their physical touch remained.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected to feel what Star felt. She almost pushed away, her instinctual reaction to break whatever connection there was between them, but she didn't. She frowned down at Star's legs when feeling just how tired and physically exhausted she was. Sighing, she stopped walking, bringing Star to a halt too. She had, indeed, created a solid emotional wall between them once she'd realized she could, mostly for fear of having her own emotions flow to Star like Star's was to her. Ellesandra didn't try to delve into anything they sense in Star, but feeling that physical exhaustion she moved to stand in front of Star instead, leaning down. "On my back." The words were an order - gruff, and still irritated. Start had pushed herself too far, obviously not knowing her limits. She'd pushed herself hard enough for it to be a danger to her, and thus to their survival in getting to this elven encampment. Ellesandra was leaning forward slightly, having removed her pack and set it on the ground next to them to make it easy for Star to lean into her back and wrap arms around Ellesandra's neck or shoulders. She didn't know if Star would do so without fighting, but Ellesandra was in no mood to argue the point. She was angry at Star for not saying something earlier, and there was guilt at not realizing just how bad off Star was. She'd trusted that Star had the remaining stamina, having not known Star enough to be able to tell the signs and how far she could push herself. That had obviously been a mistake.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Feeling the support leave her side, Star nearly stumbled and fell over. But she didn't. She managed to keep her balance, then looked curiously at Ellesandra. The two elves felt it better they not say anything. It seemed this was business between the knight and the mystic. So they stayed quiet as Star lightly flushed in the cheeks. But she didn't fight. She did as asked, moving to Ellesandra's back to lean over them so she could slide her arms around their neck. Her hold was tender and thankful. Her skin was soft around Ellesandra's neck. She rested her head against the back of theirs, and eased her legs into their hold when the time came for her to be carried. Then, the emotions returned. Shame. Guilt. Gratitude. Admiration, even. Conflicting feelings that made for a difficult to unravel ball of emotion that was tightly coiled in Star's heart. But the relief was there. She was able to rest, and with that, the serenity that surrounded her grew stronger. Ellesandra still would easily be able to refute any actual influence her powers had on the other; they might recall Star had said previously that her powers of actual influence only really worked with those who didn't know her, and with how easily Ellesandra could recognize her powers for what they were, it certainly made sense how only someone unaware of who she was could actually be influenced by her against their will. But for what it was worth, Star's influence hardly was like a psychic. It didn't implant thoughts or override feelings. But it would be hard to feel violent against someone whose presence was so...Reassuring. Soothing. Calm. "I'm sorry.." came a quiet whisper into Ellesandra's ear, just for them to hear. "I didn't want you to think me a monster."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra closed her eyes, letting the feel of Star's weight lean in on her back. She hesitated for a moment, feeling all the emotions flow through again, but gritted her teeth and ensured her own barrier was up against the calming influence. Being calmer might theoretically be helpful right now, but she did not want Star's power influencing her or touching her emotions any more than they had to. She took her sack and glanced over to Morrun, tossing the sack at his feet without a word. The order was obvious; while she carried Star, he was to carry her pack. Only after that did she hoop her hands beneath Star's thighs, lean forward a bit more then pushed into a fully standing position. The cuts on her thighs screamed in irritation at the added weight, but Ellesandra kept her jaw clenched and ignored the pain. They were small enough that she knew this wouldn't do any real damage other than irritate them and cause more pain as she walked, which she could deal with. Her head turned to look at Star's sharply when Star admitted her worries. There was surprise, followed by confusion. Who in the world told Star that she was a monster? Just because Ellesandra didn't want someone peering into her emotions or influencing them did not mean she was a monster. Her power was unfortunate, and was one that Ellesandra would prefer not to interact with, but it wasn't monstrous - at least not in what she'd seen so far. "Don't be ridiculous." The words were scolding. She wanted Star to know that her being a monster was a ridiculous concept to Ellesandra. She didn't say more though, not with the two elves following along while Ellesandra began the walk again. The added weight would tire her out quicker, but the good thing was Ellesandra was used to hauling heavy sacks and equipment for long hikes. It wouldn't be a good or fun time, but she would be able to do it - especially because she wasn't experiencing any particular lethargy from haste spells or anything right now.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A few emotions came in response to Ellesandra's words. More shame. Uncertainty. Confusion. A twisted gut that cried out apology for simply existing as she was. She might be able to see Ellesandra's emotions, feel them the way an empath could, but...That didn't give clarity to the reasons for them all. The emotions of someone who was lying were obvious to her. The emotions of someone with ulterior motives almost always gave them away, even those who were stoic and adept at concealing it all. But Ellesandra's emotions were...Complicated, and forced under a pile of rubble shaped as guilt. It made it tricky to know the first thing about them. It made it difficult to know when anger was inwardly focused, or when it was at Star herself. She said nothing further on the matter, electing only to rest and try to sort through her own feelings. She didn't pry into Ellesandra's. But her presence was there, open for Ellesandra to tap into any time, even if it was the most likely scenario that the walls remained up as much as possible between the two for the remainder of the trip. Morrun did manage the pack well, only occasionally needing to stop and rest his shoulder, which would give Ellesandra some time to set Star down and limber up before the march continued. And if the knight saw no further need to speak, there would be little beyond small talk between the husband and wife to fill the air as they walked through the natural path to their ultimate destination. Eventually, Morrun ran ahead a little. A hand rose up, then weaved a glyph in the air in green arcane energy, which opened up a hole in what was otherwise a rock face, revealing a path that cut into more of the forest. It grew more verdant as they walked deeper in. More green, more alive. A subtle mana clung to the air, reinforcing the natural growth in the area. It was pleasant and refreshing, but not very strong. Still, a welcome feeling after walking for so long; the sun had set on them, and it was well into night when they arrived. Morrun kept to the front, knowing they were in safe territory, and waved to unseen archers in trees to signal them that all was well. Nothing could be seen in those trees. A lethal place for any unwelcome visitors. But their safe passage led them to a sturdy wooden gate that had vines crawling up along the adjoining wall. Their approach was met with a raising of the gate, which allowed them into the settlement proper. Given the late hour and fatigue on everyone's bodies, Morrun turned to Ellesandra and Star with his offer: "I invite you both to my home. It isn't much, but I do have a spare bed." Spare bed, singular. "...Though I won't be offended if you'd prefer an inn. I'd happily pay for your rooms, if so, and can take you to it. We don't get many visitors as you can imagine, so its amenities are sparse, but...I don't know about you, but a rock would be a wonderfully soft pillow for me at this point. Whatever the case, I will have business to discuss in the morning with you both. A matter of my thanks, and honouring the original agreement, of course."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra tried her best not to feel or notice Star's emotions. Even as they came across the apparent link, she was doing her best to not only block out her own emotions from being noticed or felt by Star, but the other way around. Just like she felt as if it was invasive for Star to just be able to SEE the things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone, Ellesandra wasn't about to intentionally or actively do the same thing in the other direction. She'd give Star whatever privacy she could to process the emotions she had. When they stopped for a rest with Morrun placing the pack down, Ellesandra sat Star on a nearby rock for easy perching and moved to replace the bandage on her thighs. The walking with the extra weight wasn't helping it heal closed entirely, so she wanted to ensure it got properly taken care of. She also took some time to drink water and hand the waterskin over to Star, if she didn't have her own to drink - and then they were walking again. Ellesandra was quiet, which was normal for her, as they passed through the apparent illusion protecting the elven encampment. She also didn't say anything when Morrun ran up to greet someone, and as they approached even closer her eyes scanned here and there, watching out for an ambush. As much as she could watch out, anyways - elves were notorious for being able to hide in trees well. She was certain she'd missed some scouts at some point, even with her watchfulness. There was a wary caution about her; trusting Morrun not to intentionally lead them into danger, but also recognizing that there might still be danger either way. When they got to the place that was apparently Morrun's home, she glanced back at Star. "Point me to the bed and I'll put Miss Lumina in it. She needs her rest, I'm afraid her mission to rescue your wife took more out of her than she admitted." There was a gentle scolding to her voice again, but it was only partial. There was no need to beat a dead horse, after all. "If it's okay with her, I'll find the Inn and get some food and sleep there. I don't think she's in any particular danger from the two of you, or other elves here, is she?" Ellesandra's eyebrows narrowed as she asked the question, intentionally making it sound like a threat that if she was in danger, they would have to deal with her.



</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was some measure of guilt on the faces of the two elves upon hearing that Star had pushed herself so hard, but it was also plain and obvious that was the case. The two could do nothing but be grateful for what was done for them. "She'll have everything she needs to recuperate, I promise you," said Morrun, earning a smile and a nod of agreement from Lissana. A bed and a few home cooked meals was the least they could provide, though there was some mild and short-lived surprise when Ellesandra opted to take to the inn. Was there perhaps an...Assumption being made about Star and Ellesandra? They didn't comment. "Neither of you will be in any danger. Even if this settlement is for we elves, we shelter others plenty. Nobody will give it a second thought. If someone got in the gates, they are welcome," he said, then gestured down the residential street. The pathways within the settlement were made of wood which gave solid foundation to support over the otherwise soft earth. Through the main street the group came to a central square that branched off in several directions, including two wooden staircases that moved up and into the trees. Looking up, several buildings and presumably residences were built around the trunks of sturdy, tall trees; many of the trees in this grove extended up into the sky like spires. Mighty redwoods left to grow for ages, the most massive of which stood at what was presumably the heart of the city, wide enough in its circumference that it might take a solid half hour to walk a full revolution around the wooden pathways that were build around it. But for the time being, the group was more focused on their grounded section of the grove. Other elves moved around, not paying much attention to Star or Ellesandra, despite those two being the shortest people around, with everyone else reaching near or above six feet tall. It being so late at night did mean the activity was minimal, with only a few other denizens of the grove showing their faces, many of them just night patrol guards donning leather armor and sheathed blades with longbows over their shoulders. It was peaceful, and it seemed there was enough of a martial presence to keep the grove safe. Eventually, the two came to a humble wooden home. Not very large, but stepping inside did bring with it a cozy feeling. A simple, warm place to live. Morrun led Ellesandra through the main living space to a side room that had a guest bed ready and waiting for Star. It was certainly big enough for two with room to spare, supporting why the elves had been taken slightly off guard by the knight's insistence to take to the inn when there was space right there to sleep for them. But no questions were asked; once Star was set to bed, where she more or less fell asleep instantly, Morrun was waiting to meet Ellesandra by the door to the room after kissing his wife goodnight. "Be along shortly, love," he whispered to his wife, then smiled at Ellesandra. First, he handed the woman their pack with a bit of a grunt as he worked it off his shoulder; he'd needed to wear it on one shoulder while his own pack was on his back, and had swapped many times during the trip. "Dunno how you can bear to carry that thing," he said with a soft laugh. "Let me walk you to the inn, make sure you have your bearings so you can find your way back here in the morning."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed Morrun, eyes scanning the trees and the surrounding elves. At first, she had her guard up high, not entirely sure this wasn't some form of trap, but as they got deeper into the settlement and she saw plenty of signs of civilian elves, not just militia or military or anything like that, she began to relax some. She ignored the look between Morrun and his wife and instead eyed the area around the house before going in for the tour. When finding the guest room, she walked around the bed to take a good look at it before turning and lowering down to lightly place the sleepy Star onto the bed directly, encouraging her to relax her hold and fall back onto the bed. Ellesandra's thighs screamed at this, both from the exertion of carrying Star this whole way as well as their wounds. She gritted her teeth, fighting through the pain of that and her muscles reminding her she didn't do the same military drills she had previously to keep in shape. She wasn't entirely surprised Star fell asleep quickly, but Ellesandra did take a moment to ensure she got tucked in and had a pillow and was comfortable. She'd also been sure to remove Star's own pack or anything extra, though she didn't touch Star's clothing. The pack was set to the side, before she turned and followed Morrun out. She took the pack back, throwing it over her shoulders again, and nodding to him. "Years of practice, you get used to it when you carry your life on your back." She didn't remember the last time she'd settled down in any one place for more than maybe a week at a time, unless on a job. And even then, it wasn't often. Her gaze went around the place again while following Morrun to the Inn, waiting for the other shoe to drop and see why he wanted to guide her or if he had something else he needed to say.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The walk to the inn was unremarkable. Morrun looked too tired to hold any sort of conversation. But he did genuinely want the knight to have their bearings in this place. A ways down the road from his home, then a right, then a left after some more walking, and they were closer to the central, massive tree. A few more civilians were about, but most were inside. The inn had clear signage: 'The Sleepy Seldarine'. Knowledge of elvish lore would reveal this to be a nod to an old elven pantheon, but it was little more than a name. Before stepping in, Morrun had but a single piece of business. A coin purse that he held out to Ellesandra. If taken and inspected, Ellesandra would find fifty platinum pieces inside. Each worth ten gold, which meant this was five hundred gold pieces worth of coin. "Please...Take this. For the inn, for food, for provisions, supplies..." Five hundred gold bought all that and a bit more within the first fifty gold, so five hundred was clearly for more than that. "...And as thanks for all you did. I was trying to raise the money myself to pay off the pirates, but as you can tell it was slow going. Too slow. I won't be destitute without this, before you go thinking I'm giving you the shirt off my back. But you deserve that, too. I had taken it on myself to help Star as a favour, a mutually beneficial thing. But in the time it took her to arrive, the pirates rolled in and took over and, well...You know the rest. You both will always be welcome here, but...Since you carry your life on your back, I suspect you'll be on your way before long. You've saved me from having a great tragedy in my life. If parting with a little coin can help spare you the same, then I won't take no for an answer. And something tells me Star isn't the sort to accept the deserved generosity of others." He smiled. "A pure heart like hers is lucky to have a cautious, sensible eye like yours watching over her. The world needs guardians like you. So, please. Lissana and I will be fine, thanks to you both."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along, only glancing at the sign. She didn't know too much about elves, so the name didn't ring a bell to her. When Morrun turned to hand over a bag of coin, she looked down at it, then up to him. One eyebrow raised, having not expected to be paid for this job at all. When he explained that it had been saved up to save his wife and wouldn't be impacting his livelihood itself, she reached forward and took it without a complaint. A quick glance inside to see the platinum made her tilt her head and look back up at him in surprise. This was way more than she would have charged even if she had hired herself out for the job. "I hardly think I should be considered a world guardian." She considered the cut to her thighs and how she'd let just three lowly pirates injure her. She'd underestimated the first mate it had seemed, and his willingness to harm his own crew in order to get her. "I'll be sure to share this with Miss Lumina before we part ways." Or should she consider this her payment to help Star along in her journey? It would still be more than she'd expect from that, not unless Star was hiring her for a long journey. Still, it was an option. "Was there anything else you needed? Otherwise I would like to change my dressings and then settle in for the night, and I'm sure your wife would like your comfort this evening after everything she has been through."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun looked briefly perplexed by the notion of Ellesandra and Star parting ways. But, assumptions were cast aside and he nodded at the following words. "Of course. I don't mean to keep you. Good night, ma'am. Please come by in the morning so we can see you off." With a smile, he left Ellesandra to check into the inn. A simple process, name asked and recorded in the log book, payment of a single gold piece for a night's stay received, and key and directions given to the room. It was a comfortable room. A nice bed, simple amenities, including a magical shower that sprayed water from a blue crystal affixed to the ceiling of the small restroom that Ellesandra could use to wash away they day's woes if they so desired, either before or after sleeping. The room was theirs for the night, and a well-earned rest awaited them. Whenever they did come to find sleep, however...Their dream would find them in a waking, lucid state within it. Clearly understanding they were dreaming, the world around them took the space of a blank, black void initially. After a minute or so, focus came to the realm. A wilderness path. Not the one they had taken to the grove. Not one Ellesandra had seen before. The knight was in their full armor with their weapon at their hip, despite presumably falling asleep without it. The wounds on their legs didn't exist in this dream state. There was nobody around initially...But after looking around for a while in this dream, Ellesandra would spot someone. Or, what was presumably a person. It had a vaguely human shape, but was but a cloud of darkness. Black, smokey lines wafted up and off the figure. They were five-foot-seven, or thereabout. Not immediately identifiable as masculine or feminine in build. A vague black avatar of a person. Featureless. Unarmed. And despite the lack of eyes or anything resembling the same, Ellesandra would be able to know this figure was...Looking at them. Silent, for now, but...Watching expectantly.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra got her room and went to relax. She took good use of the shower, enjoying the water pouring on her head and letting it both wash away the sweat from the walk and the fight but also spending some time working on dealing with the emotions that had arisen that day. She tried to push them all back down into the box where they should have stayed the whole time, not coming out to hit her again at the sight and thought of Star. When she finally did change her dressings and get into bed, she was wearing just underclothes and had her armor and sword to the side, so it was strange waking up in her dream to...being fully armored. And in the wilderness. She looked around, obviously confused. Was this a dream, or something else? It seemed a bit more real than most of her dreams, but she couldn't really tell well. Typically when she dreamed, it was bad dreams; nightmares and memories she'd repressed and that only came up during her subconscious dreams. Now, she found herself staring at a shadowy black figure that she could tell was looking at her, but couldn't make anything else out about them. Her hand moved to rest on the hilt of her sword, prepared to withdraw it if needed, and she took up a more defensive posture in front of this creature. She didn't speak either, just watching it and waiting to see what it did, or if it made any hostile actions. It might not mean harm, but Ellesandra tended to be cautious and assume the worst.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The vague shadow figure didn't show signs of hostility. It simply spoke to Ellesandra, in a voice that didn't quite sound natural. The voice was as androgynous as the shape of the figure. "...She will die," said the voice. "History will repeat itself, as it does on, and on, and on again. Not tomorrow...But soon. To walk beside her in staunch defiance of fate...Or to turn and allow yourself the comfort of not knowing how, or when...I wonder which you will choose." As the voice spoke, a figure appeared before it. It was, quite obviously, Star. Bruised, beaten, bloody...But as they looked up at Ellesandra, their face changed. Shifted. It wasn't Star anymore, but the princess from Ellesandra's past. Tear-filled eyes, fear filling them as death loomed over them. Then, back to Star. Then the princess. Then Star. Shifting, melding together, interchanging with one another with swift flickers; it was a reflection of Ellesandra's subconscious association of the two women. The smoky figure remained still. But Ellesandra would find their legs chained at the ankles, with the chains taut and affixed to a mountain that was miles behind the knight. The knight could walk no closer to the smoky figure and the desperate woman that was on their knees before them. Ten feet separated them, but it was...A distance that could not be closed. Just barely out of reach. "To face the inevitable...Or to walk away..."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was confused at first, when the shadow figure said she will die. Who would die? And then the figure appeared to be Star and Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She clenched her teeth, the rapier coming out of it's sheath as if to strike down the illusionary Star. She began to move to do so when the image changed. The rapier fell to the ground, clattering against the dirt as Star's form changed into that of Marigold's. Bright red hair was combed perfectly down her back, a single braid in a decorative circlet around the front of her head like she always used to wear. The freckles on her cheek standing out against pale skin and bright blue eyes looking down at Ellesandra. A wide smile that lit up her face, eyes that held hope and naivety and pure optimism for the world. Though at this moment, it wasn't that expression. Is the one Ellesandra remembered well. The look of surprise, tears in her eyes as she looked up at her captors, the pain and acceptance on her face as the blade was falling. "Mari!" The name, or nickname, escaped her lips without thought, as if saying it now would prevent the past from happening. Fuck, this was a nightmare, wasn't it? The image changed back to Star. From pure looks alone, they weren't very similar. But their dress, how they held themselves, their pure heart and happiness to help anyone and everyone they could, their stubbornness when they had made up their mind on something; it all struck deep. They may have different physical looks, but they were very close to the same beyond that. With the change back to Star, Ellesandra was broken out of the shock and grief that filled her again. "A dream." She said to herself, trying to stumble back away from the figure and tripping over the chains that had appeared. The normally graceful and poised bodyguard fell on her ass, looking down to see herself chained at the ankles in shock, then back up to the shadow creature that kept switching its appearance. "Get away." There was fear, there. Fear, anguish, guilt. She didn't want to be faced with the same guilt she'd been shoving down for years, and seeing Marigold's face had forced that back up so strongly that Ellesandra didn't have the presence of mind to try to mask her emotions or repress them. "Stop it."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
With Ellesandra falling on their backside, the figure changed back to Marigold. "Please don't leave me," said Marigold, her voice exactly as Ellesandra remembered it. But as soon as those words left Marigold's lips, it was Star again. But the pleading look never left her eyes. "I need you," said Star. But then was back to Marigold. One in the same, the two figures were shifting back and forth at random. The shadowy figure then extended one arm outward. In their hand formed a shadowy, deadly scythe. The tool of the reaper. The intent was obvious. "Run away," said the shadowy figure. "Embrace your cowardice," it continued. "Don't leave me!" screamed Marigold through choked sobs. Or was it...Star? Whichever woman it was, they were sobbing, crying out for Ellesandra. "Pathetic fool." The shadow figure's last words came as it swung its scythe down towards Star. But just before the scythe could strike and kill Star before Ellesandra's eyes, adrenaline spiked in their living, conscious body, and thrust them awake. It had been minutes in the dream...But the sun was rising in the waking world. It was morning.

Ellesandra
Ellesandra stayed on her ass, watching with wide eyes and mouth partially open, up until the scythe was heading towards Star. She threw herself forward, as if trying to block it, but she knew it was too late. She'd been on her ass, just watching, for too long - even if she were able to reach Star or the scythe while chained up. She wouldn't make it in time. Just as she was about to see the scythe split Star, her eyes opened and she shot up in bed into a sitting position. Her breathing was heavy and sweat covered her body. It truly had been a nightmare, one that she was sure she'd tossed and turned in. Had she screamed? She might have screamed there at the end, when Star was about to be killed before her eyes. She put her face in her hands and tried to practice deep breaths to calm her racing heart down. The sight of Marigold wasn't one that she was entirely unused to in her dreams; it wasn't the first time she'd had a nightmare of the day Marigold had died, but she usually hardly remembered the dream - just woke up from the nightmare and couldn't sleep longer. The addition of star, and comparison between the two, bothered Ellesandra. She moved out of bed and took another shower that morning; it was necessary with how much she'd sweat through the night, and to help calm her racing body and emotions. If she was going to go visit Star, she needed to get her emotions in check. There was no need for Star to see the panic and increased guilt at the idea of her leaving Star and Star dying because of it. She slammed the side of her fist into the wall and cursed to her breath. As she got out, she quickly dressed, but she left her armor off. There was no way Star was leaving today, and if Star planned to leave she was going to shove the woman back down into bed to rest, so if Ellesandra were to stay in the realms of the settlement there was no need for armor. As such, she found her way to Morrun's early in the morning wearing basic brown breaches and what would be a typical man's white jerkin, hanging loosely around the small curves she did have. Her rapier did still rest on her right hip, the only bit of her normal attire that she was wearing currently. She knocked softly at the door, wondering if this were too early to check on Star. She needed to, after that dream.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The knock was met with some shuffling and footsteps. The door opened, Lissana waiting to greet the knight with a smile. She opened the door and invited them in. "Please, come in! I was just making breakfast, I'll make some more for you. I hope you like hot cakes," she said, the elven woman clearly in higher spirits after a night's rest. Invited in, the kitchen was at the back of the home, with a dining room a bit before that. A simple table and seating for four. Morrun was nowhere to be seen, presumably up the flight of stairs to the right, possibly still in bed. The door on the left wall that led to the guest room was closed. "If you'd like to check in on Star, I'm sure she'll need a good meal as much as the rest of us. She might still be asleep."
 
</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She waited patiently, and when the door opened to Lissana, Ellesandra lowered her head in a polite greeting. "No need to go out of your way, Miss. I simply wanted to confirm Star was doing well, and then I'll be on my way. I believe the Inn has it's own breakfast too." There was a pause and she glanced past Lissana towards where the kitchen was. "Are you sure you should be up and about cooking already? If you need more rest or time with your husband to help recover, I would be happy to cook something for all of you." As much as Ellesandra wanted to rush to Star's room and check on her, she also needed to remember that Lissana had gone through hell the past few days as well. She may not have been on the verge of passing out, like Star was, but there were emotional and mental strains that Ellesandra probably couldn't see. Could Star? Did seeing that type of thing wear Star out more? She pushed the thought to the side. Maybe she'd ask at one point, but not right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana shook her head. "On the contrary! A little normalcy is really helpful. Being at home, cooking for my husband and our esteemed guests is just what I need to...Feel normal again, you know?" she said, offering a smile to Ellesandra. "I...You can bet I'll not be leaving the safety of this grove for a while. But so long as I'm here, I'll be okay. So please, don't assume I'm that bad a cook," she said with a teasing smile. "I've some fresh fruit I fetched at dawn to go with it all. Please, I insist. You and Star are the ones who need rest. If anyone would take my place cooking, I'd say it ought to be Morrun, if my darling wasn't the sort to set fire to the kitchen for trying." Another smile. A kind woman, once she opened up. Long term trauma was more likely; a hesitance to ever leave what is known and comfortable. But the woman could face that in time. For now, it seemed assuming some normalcy was the therapy she needed. She could, however, just be adept at pushing it all down, like Ellesandra did. Only Star would be able to tell, but she was still presumably sleeping in the guest bed.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
That made sense. Ellesandra nodded, relenting. "Okay, as you wish. I appreciate your hospitality. Don't let Morrun work you too hard though, he does deserve to do his fair share around here too." Ellesandra was joking, of course. She had no idea what Morrun did around the house and wouldn't actually judge him at all for it, either way. "I'll leave you to it while I check on Miss Lumina, but if you need any assistance don't hesitate to call out." She wanted the woman to feel comfortable around her, at least while she was here. It was entirely possible that she associate Ellesandra with death, since the first time she'd seen Ellesandra she'd been cleaning the blood of pirates off her sword. Or associate her with the whole horrible situation that happened. Walking through to the guest room door, Ellesandra gave it a very light knock. She didn't want to wake Star if Star were sleeping, but she also didn't want to just walk in without knocking in case Star was needing privacy for any reason. If there was no answer to the knock, she would lightly crack the door and peek inside, just to ensure Star was sleeping soundly and didn't look like she'd had a rough night or anything.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana gave a giggle in response. "Worry not, he's around for all the things that need a little muscle or his big brain to figure out," she said back, then moved to the kitchen to resume her cooking. A simple breakfast, really, cooked over the fire of the home's oven. There was no immediate answer to the knock. Cracking the door would reveal Star was just waking, arms stretching up over her head with a big yawn. She then opened one eye as she rubbed the sleep out of the other. She smiled a bright, beautifully happy smile to see Ellesandra peeking through the door. Even if they were mostly obscured behind it, Star clearly recognized them by as little detail as just an eye through the crack. "Good morning, Ellesandra," said Star, sleepy but slowly waking. Seemed she didn't have a rough night. But as long as she could see Ellesandra, there was that...Stare again. Her way of checking on the knight.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let out a soft breath when she saw Star waking, and doing so in a way that seemed like she was okay. In fact, she had a bright smile on her face. The sigh of relief was minimal compared to the flood of relieved feelings washing through Ellesandra. She was fine, it was just a dream. She didn't know why she had dreamt it; likely, she had a subconscious fear of Star meeting the same fate as Marigold if Ellesandra didn't accompany her to protect her. Which meant, what choice did she have? There was a grief and anxiety that accompanied the relief, thinking about the dream and Marigold, but Ellesandra wrangled that into submission like she did with all of her emotions. A bottled up, ready to overflow emotional bomb, just waiting to finally release and explode, but for now it was bottled up. Not that this prevented Star from seeing it, however. Slipping inside and closing the door behind her, Ellesandra crossed her arms and looked Star up and down, checking for any signs of continued fatigue. "Stop that." Her eyes met Star's, at that stare that she was giving her. "I get that you can't control that you can see or maybe even feel what's going on in me, but stop actively trying to understand." A boundary she was at least trying to set. Though despite how abrupt her words were, Ellesandra wasn't angry. Nor was she ashamed of Star or what she could do. No, there was more...fear. Not afraid of Star herself, but afraid of someone seeing into her. Of asking questions. Of pushing her to process things she still wasn't ready to do. "How are you, fatigue wise? Do you need help getting out to the table for breakfast?" And a quick topic change, trying to encourage Star not to go down that route of conversation or ask why Ellesandra was so protective over how she felt.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star could see the emotions. The relief. The concern. It told her something was on Ellesandra's mind. Some guesses popped into her head, but she never assumed such things if she could help it. She was about to ask, but then the knight interrupted her before she began. She blinked, then blushed a little, and maybe even pouted a tiny bit. Understanding people was sort of her...Thing. Core to her being. So to have a wall slam down over it was clearly frustrating. Confusing, even. She heard the questions, the shift in topic. But Star was a bit too stubborn to just let them lead her along like that and pretend they hadn't said anything. "...Yesterday morning I told you what I saw. And you told me that there is no mountain," she said, her voice kind and gentle. Sympathy overtook her features, replacing the pout. "So...As far as I can see, until you point it out to me otherwise...There is no mountain," she said, speaking in words that only really made sense to the two of them. "That won't stop me from seeing the way the winds blow around the shape of what certainly isn't there. There's only so much I can willfully blind myself. And even that...I have no shame admitting that it doesn't sit well with me. But I do now, and always will, respect your privacy on the matter. I won't ask...But if what led us into the whole situation yesterday is any indication, I can't see suffering go unanswered. So at the very least...As long as we're together, I'll be watching. Even if there's nothing I can do...Sometimes it's just nice to know someone cares." She smiled, then swiftly sprung up from the bed, using Ellesandra's own quick diversionary tactics against them as she shot up to her feet. "As for my fatigue? All gone!" she said, beaming bright. "The only reason I was so drained was because I'd sapped almost all my mana for what I was doing. Casting the spells on their own was strenuous enough, but, ahehe...Casting spells in quick succession makes them exceptionally more taxing, and I only had seconds to do what I was doing to ensure we got out safely, so...Point is, I'm recovering! Not back to full strength I admit, but, I'm not sore any longer."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's jaw clenched. Anger spiked at Star's words, though it wasn't really anger at Star. It was the grief of what that mountain was masking itself as anger because that was easier for Ellesandra to process. If she pretended the mountain didn't exist, she didn't have to deal with it. The comment about a mountain reminded her that she'd been chained to one in her dream, and the idea made her blink her eyes and turn her head to the side. Had her eyes teared up, just for a moment, before she blinked it away? No way to tell now, as Ellesandra was quick to turn after Star hopped out of bed to display how well she was doing now. "Good. You need your food then. Come out when you're ready." She could respond to Star's comment about someone caring, about being able to tell there was a lot Ellesandra was not saying to or showing her, but she didn't. Instead she slipped out of the room, leaving the door closed behind to give Star any privacy she needed. Ellesandra didn't go immediately, though. She took a moment in the hallway to ensure she was fully in control again, that her eyes weren't about to tear up once more, before walking down the hallway back towards the kitchen.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star didn't need to see a tear to see the emotions that caused it. Her expression remained sympathetic in the face of the tears, in the face of the anger, all of it. It wasn't like this was the first time someone had responded, well, emotionally to her stance on the matter. She almost expected it at this point. Star did take some time to get ready, namely by making use of the shower the elven couple had attached to the guest room. When she arrived to join for breakfast, her hair was damp and weighted down, but clean and pretty as could be. Her dress seemed to have had the blood removed from it from when Star woke just a handful of minutes earlier and now. Magic, perhaps? Regardless, Star took a seat just as Lissana was coming out with plates. Hot cakes, as promised, with two kinds of berry jam, a refined elven syrup that was sweet and earthy, and a large bowl of fresh fruits and berries to enjoy on their own, or perhaps to garnish the hotcakes with in the case of the berries alongside the jam. Adding to this, some meat sausage was divvied up on each plate to add some protein to the meal. The food was simple, but wholesome, and the elven cuisine had a hallmark elven complexity to the simple dish. Cold milk and orange juice was offered to drink alongside. Overall, an enjoyable meal that would give a good deal of energy for the day head. Lissana called up for Morrun once she laid out the plates, then joined the other two. Morrun shambled down the stairs, having clearly not slept the greatest, and joined the others with a smile after kissing his wife good morning. "So, Star, Ellesandra," began Morrun as he grabbed one set of cutlery to poke at a hotcake and take from the communal pile of them that was placed in the center. There were enough hotcakes for each person to have three of the medium-sized treats, but Lissana didn't look like a big eater. That, plus the huge helping of fruit meant there would certainly be leftovers unless Ellesandra had a bottomless gut. Morrun put some syrup on his hotcake. "What is the plan from here? I owe you the information promised, which will undoubtedly shape the next leg of your journey. I don't mean to rush, but I also don't wish to hold you up, so...If you intend on staying a while, as much can wait until after breakfast I'm sure. But I still am curious, if it's not prying to ask. Just, well...It would be nice to know that bright horizons await heroes like you both."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra would have offered to help set the table, but by the time Star came out she had been sitting in her own spot, having put her hair back up in a ponytail like it had been the latter half of the day yesterday, and staring down at her hands clasped on the table in front of her. Her fingertips were callused, hands rough; the hands of someone who had worked their life. Not just the hands of a warrior, but someone who had done manual labor as well, wielding tools as well as weapons. Her hands tightened as she struggled with her emotions, the bottle seemingly having sprung a leak. When Star sat down, she looked up and met Star's gaze for but a moment, but she couldn't look at Star long. Not while the memory of Star and Marigold's faces replacing one another was so present in her mind, from the dream. She looked away, happy for the distraction when Lissana came in with the breakfast and began placing them down in front of them. Ellesandra had leaned back, being respectful and waiting until Morrun arrived and began eating before she touched her own food. She was ravenous, and wasn't ashamed when her stomach had growled at the prospect of finally eating after the long day they'd had yesterday. She started with the sausage, quiet as Morrun began speaking. She glanced at Star for a moment, then back to Morrun. "For my part, it depends on Miss Lumina here. I'll be accompanying her until her mission is complete, so it's how she would like to proceed." It was a decision she'd come to, an easy one, after that dream. Even if it had been her subconscious bringing that image up, that she'd be running away from Star and dooming her to the same fate Marigold had, which made the decision easier, she knew she wouldn't have been able to just walk away. Not when Star so clearly indicated she needed the help. She didn't meet Star's gaze after saying this, eyes returning to her plate and using the food as a distraction to prevent meeting eyes or being questioned about that decision.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The surprise on Star's face was obvious. She looked at Ellesandra. If they had been alone, Star would have quite a few questions about when all this changed. But now she was facing down two elves where were...Also having trouble understanding. Morrun in particular had been told just last night that they were parting ways. Or did the knight mean in the eventual conclusion of this? It was vague, and very much not something he was about to bring up and possibly cause confusion or hurt feelings on the matter. So eyes went to Star. And at that point, Star just decided to not look a gift horse in the mouth. She had been struggling since she decided to venture on without Nina - a non-violent woman in a violent world, after all - so having Ellesandra was as comforting pragmatically as it was emotionally. It had only been a day, but...Ellesandra was an easy person to admire with the way they faced danger. Star also couldn't help but notice that her knightly companion couldn't look at her. But she didn't draw attention to it. As she said...There was no mountain. "Oh, uhm, well," Star began a little nervously. "I was hoping the information you had would lead me to a way to get to my home plane. I was told you had information about that, so I guess our plans depend on the details of what you have to share, Morrun," she said, specifically using 'our' in her words. Since Ellesandra was in it for the long haul, apparently. Happily joined, if confused about it, Star remained. Morrun nodded, pausing to finish a mouthful of hotcake before answering. "Right. Well. Let's finish breakfast then, and I can tell you all about those details. I don't wish to get your hopes up massively, but I will do all I can to help you along, all the same." Smiles were exchanged, and little more than small talk joined in on breakfast through to its conclusion unless Ellesandra had more to offer. The lion's share of the food was the knight's to have; Morrun and Lissana both turned out to be light eaters. Star enjoyed her share, a bit more than she might normally as she was recovering her strength, but seemed to prefer the fruit. Not that she didn't enjoy the hotcakes and sausage, but even with the hotcake, she smothered it in berries and seemed to delight in specifically the taste of the blueberries, with her face lighting up with delight in each bite. A favourite food, clearly, as unless others were grabbing them, she specifically sought the blueberries out to take for herself, looking a little sheepish and asking if anyone else wanted more before helping herself to the last of them. This left plenty for the knight to enjoy, and the group remained until it was clear all had their fill. Lissana then set about cleaning up, and Morrun and Star moved over to the living space so they could discuss what Star came here to learn in the first place. Star shot a glance at Ellesandra, inviting them to join along and hear what Morrun had to say.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had, at first, just taken one hotcake and otherwise added a lot of the fruit and sausage to her plate. She had eaten the hotcake without any of the jam, though as the meal went on and she saw how Star was reaching for the blueberries, she separated them on her plate and stopped eating them. As the conversation went on and Morrun confirmed they would discuss later, Ellesandra mostly tuned out the small talk. Oh, she was listening, but only for key words, her name, or if anyone addressed her specifically. Instead her eyes were down on her plate, eating in silence and trying her best to keep that 'mountain' bottled back down. The dream last night had really fucked with her sense of emotional stability, and that on top of how they had already been stirred up by Star herself. In all reality, it was probably Star's presence that had caused the dream. When she'd finished with what she was going to eat, and after Star had asked if anyone wanted the last of the blueberries, Ellesandra deftly lifted her own plate and moved to sit it in front of Star. It had what was remaining of the blueberries Ellesandra had gotten, properly saved to the side once she'd realized how happily Star had eaten them. She didn't say anything with the sharing of the food, but instead drank some of the milk that was provided and turning to Morrun, speaking up for the first time since the small talk had started, and simply asking him a couple of questions about the elven settlement - what it was like, the people, and how it defended itself against people like the pirates. Small talk that would distract from the small gesture of kindness, one that Ellesandra did not want to be commented upon. As they were finished and were moving to the living space to discuss the next steps, Ellesandra stood. She helped Lissana collect the plates and all the cutlery at least, but soon left Lissana to doing her normal duties and getting back into the swing of her normal life while moving to stand near the entrance of the living area. A habit of hers gotten from years of being a bodyguard; standing near the entrances and scanning the room, but not sitting to relax as part of the conversation.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was a woman of emotion. That much was obvious. But even firmly knowing that, it might come to surprise Ellesandra that the simple act of thoughtfulness and kindness was enough to bring Star to tears. Actual tears. When she saw what the knight had done, the tears ran down her cheek. She took a moment to herself, dabbing a napkin against her eyes as she collected herself again. Her bright smile and giggles and assurances that she was fine were enough to keep the elven couple from worrying too much, but it was still quite the reaction. She enjoyed those last blueberries on Ellesandra's plate most of all, savoured one at a time. It resolved without incident, and things moved back to business. Morrun sat on the couch, facing Star who sat on an opposing seat, and both of them gave odd looks to Ellesandra who stood by the door, but neither questioned it. Morrun began with a clearing of his throat: "Right. Well. A bit about me, I'm a scholar of the planes. The Material Plane refers to central planes that are surrounded by inner and outer planes, as far as the scholarly understanding goes. But there are quite a few planes that qualify as Material. I understand from the description that you're from another such place, Star," he said, earning a nod from Star. "Right. So, to reach another plane like that requires some strong magic, or a portal. From what I observed, you were capable of using Dimension Door, the telltale door-like creations of that spell are quite obvious. Would you perhaps be capable of making stable portals for yourself?" asked Morrun. Star gave a small nod, though with a rub at her neck. "Yes, though...That's a bit tricky, and can be taxing to do. I'm still learning how to do more advanced things like that," she said, giving a nervous laugh. "No matter, no matter. That you're at least that familiar is enough. Because, well, the main thing that has had my interest as of late is that, about a year ago, there was some commotion a ways north-east of here. Along the coast, but at least another two days on the road on foot. Maybe one if you can go by coach. There were some ruins there, and some very curious individuals showed up to examine them. A band of adventurers, looked like. But notably, they had ears like a fox atop their head. Pointy and fluffy. Not terribly uncommon, but they uniquely did not have tails to accompany those ears. Combining that with their clothing and magic I observed them using, and I have it on good confidence they were from Myst." He paused for effect here. Star just...Blinked. This meant nothing to her. Morrun cleared his throat again. "...Myst is a plane outside the regular cosmology of the array of Material Planes. It's its own pocket of the multiverse, said to have been created a long time ago by someone known only as the Wizard of Myst. This place is host to interdimensional travelers, not unlike the githzerai or githyanki, though far, far less war-like than the githyanki. Myst, by contrast, is a place said to house two things that I think will be of great import in your mission to find your home. First...It is known as the city of gates. It is said if one can get to Myst, they can get anywhere else in the multiverse. Anywhere. From Faerun to Eberron to Ravnica to Dragonlance...Anywhere." His insistence was made clear by repetition. "And if you don't even know where to look? Well. It also houses what it calls the Athenaeum. Said to be the single greatest collection of knowledge in all the multiverse, a library of infinite and impossible proportion, if there is any knowledge that exists on where your home is, Star...It will be there. So. Though it has been quite some time, it may be your best bet to begin looking where these people have been, these travelers from Myst, and by whatever means you see fit, be able to follow them to Myst and, from there, go where you need to go. Of course...If ever that leads you back here, you'll have a bed waiting." A smile. "I'm...Afraid I don't have anything tangible on that regard, however. Myst is said to have a magical cipher that protects it from unwanted travelers, and of course a race of ancient elves that guard it, which is in part, how I learned of it. There is an elder elf here in this grove, Master Ridoru, who spoke of reveries he has had about being part of this legendary band of elves, known as the Arethi, in a past life. Not that I think knowing more on that front will help you find Myst, but...I'm sure if you feel the need to talk to him, I could secure an audience."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had NOT expected that reaction. She'd snapped her head up when she saw tears and there was a mixture between panic, confusion, and guilt. These emotions weren't attached to the normal guilt that Star might sense in Ellesandra, but separate. Had Star not wanted the blueberries? Was there something wrong with giving them to her? Why were there tears? Still, the rest of the meal seemed to go on past that, but the confusion and guilt didn't entirely go away with Ellesandra making a mental note not to randomly share food with Star again. She wasn't good at emotions, certainly not her own and definitely not others, so it wasn't easy for her to tell if those had been good or bad tears. As Morrun began explaining the magic, Ellesandra felt her head hurting a little. She understood some magic, being a spellsword of her own, but others she didn't. And all this interplanar stuff was way beyond her knowledge or experience. She knew some basic things, like there was a plane where you went to when you died, that Kelemvor would guide your soul to it's appropriate afterlife - whatever that might be and whoever you might worship - but anything in depth she didn't. The idea of this Myst place, somewhere that was apparently a gateway to any other plane, was a good start though. If Star knew the specific plane they needed to go to, they'd perhaps find a way to travel there from Myst. Her gaze went to Star, letting the mage lead the conversation for their side not only because this was her mission, but also because she knew more about it. Ellesandra did offer a - "We do have some funds available for travel, should someone in Myst need it, Miss Lumina." This might be news to Star, so she felt like it needed to be shared. She hadn't yet shared the coin Morrun had given her the night before with Star intentionally, but she would once they were out of the city.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star considered the information at length. She was surprised to hear that there were funds available. She of course had a bit herself, but she hoped to get more while in Cloverport. That didn't pan out quite the way she hoped. She was still getting used to the idea that Ellesandra was even coming with her, so that, plus now having money? All variables to consider. "I see," she said, curiously looking at Ellesandra. Not to study their emotions, but just to convey her pensive nature. Her eyes flicked to the floor, just picking another spot to look at that wasn't the knight, to keep them from being uncomfortable. "Hm. Well, it certainly sounds promising, and since I won't be able to do anything with portals at least until I am back to full strength anyway, a day of travel suits me fine. If we have the funds for travel, that helps...But I don't suppose coaches often travel from this grove, Morrun?" she asked, which had him think for a moment. He blinked. "No, the closest place to secure a coach would be..." He went a bit white, then. "...C-Cloverport. R-Right.." A nervous chuckle followed. "Right, well...Uhhh...Surely there's something else," he said, racking his brain. Star giggled, waving a hand. "I'm more than used to life on the road. We can instead use the money for some extra rations for the road to supplement what I can get from the land." A comment from Star that had Lissana poking her head out of the kitchen: "I've already put together some extras we don't need that you're taking with you, and that's final!" she said in a sing-songy voice. So it seemed the money could be saved for when it was later needed, if all that was secure. Star looked at Ellesandra. "Well. Unless you feel like going back to Cloverport to risk running into our lawless friends again, I'd say we have some walking to do, and only so many hours of daylight to get to it. What say you?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head sternly when Star indicated they might go back to Cloverport to hitch a ride. No, that was a horrible idea, and not one that Ellesandra would allow Star to follow without a very good reason. However, when it came to starting off walking, she crossed her arms and looked Star up and down again, assessing her physical condition. "Are you absolutely sure you are in a fit state to start off today, Miss Lumina? You were barely able to walk straight yesterday evening and you crashed as soon as I laid you down on the bed. It may be best to rest for another day at least before we head out." Ellesandra wasn't entirely sure what urgency Star was under. It seemed she didn't know if her mother was alive or dead, but there didn't seem to be an immediate urgency since Star had been willing to go out of her way to save Morrun's wife. Or perhaps that's just who Star was and she would have done that even if it was urgent, but Ellesandra was unsure. She narrowed her eyes at Star, trying to give off an intimidating presence despite her smaller 5'1 form and the threat having no real backing to it, since she wouldn't hurt Star. "I'm not going to let you tire yourself out like that again unless it's absolutely necessary. I understand it was a magical exhaustion yesterday and you're much better after your rest, but with how bad it was I'm not sure you should be travelling on foot today."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star pouted a little, but she still listened to all Ellesandra had to say. Sure, she could use another day of rest. But... "Mmmnh, it's not absolutely necessary, no.." she conceded. "It just...Feels wrong to be idle without just cause. Obviously the cause of rest is important, but.." There was nothing to follow the but. She obviously saw the wisdom in Ellesandra's words. The rest would be good for her. "Your legs should be rested, too, so I guess we'll have to. But will you at least let me tend to your wounds, if I'm agreeing to rest completely? My mana might as well go to some use," she said, trying and failing to put up any sort of attitude. Star was too sweet for any amount of pouting or dispute to be taken as angry. If Star actually got angry, it would be obvious. This was just...Pouty that she was being forced to be idle, forced to listen take the wise choice instead of the ambitious one. Sure, it could be that nothing happened on the road. But something just as easily could, and not being fully rested could be the difference between life and death on the road.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was glad Star relented to not start the journey today, though when she suggested she should heal them, Ellesandra frowned again. The idea was reasonable, but she didn't know that she wanted to risk Star using her magic right now. She tilted her head to the side, considering. "This evening before you go to bed, IF you are absolutely confident your energy has restored and will be fine if you do it, you may tend to my wounds. Otherwise they're fine; I've received much worse than that without being treated for much longer, and I've treated these to ensure the bleeding stopped and they were disinfected. Additionally, they aren't even that deep, so no sewing necessary." While it was true that they weren't bad injuries, it was also true that Ellesandra wouldn't want to have to fight again with them still. It would effect her ease of movement, but only a little. Enough to allow Star to heal them? Maybe, only if Star was confident in her recovery of mana.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun had a bit of a smirk about him as he listened to the two go back and forth, but remained silent about it. Star focused on Ellesandra, not able to see the wayward smirking. "Deal," said Star, then shot a smile at Ellesandra. "...So what do you want to do until then, Ellesandra? I mean as fun as I'm sure guarding the door against all the law abiding civilians out there is, there's no reason we have to just sit on our butts all day, right?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a flicker of amusement in Ellesandra. On her face she didn't show it, not even a curling at the corner of her mouth, but Star would be able to see that the question and poking fun at her guarding the door amused her nonetheless. She sighed, as if very put upon, and said - "Well, I guess we can walk around and explore the settlement. I've been many places but I've not been to an elven settlement like this before, most of my interactions with your kind -" She had begun looking at Morrun as she said this, but paused as she realized how that might have sounded. There was an internal self-kick and a wince. "Er, I mean. I didn't interact with Elves much, and the trees are beautiful." That was a weak recovery, but there had been no malicious intent in the comment. Instead, it was more just an inexperience with elves in their natural culture, versus when they'd already assimilated into other nations or cultures.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star seemed pleased with the idea of walking around among nature. And smiled even brighter when she saw the amusement rise in her companion. So they did have a sense of humour after all. How pleasant.~ Star then watched with second-hand cringe as Ellesandra said 'your kind'. Morrun didn't seem put off by it in the slightest, however, even with the weak recovery. A shrug was all he had to offer. "Elves are not everywhere. Our connection to the Feywilds ensures we always maintain reverence for nature, though it's nothing compared to that of a Druid camp. The magic they can cultivate for natural splendor is unparalleled. But it's true, we do invest our time caring for the nature here. Lissana does much more with that than I do, though, as she learned to speak with animals at a young age," he explained. Star giggled at this, though she didn't explain why. Maybe she just found it cute to imagine Lissana talking about her day to a squirrel. Star then rose from her seat to stretch. "Mmnh, well, we'll leave you for now then," said Star. Morrun nodded. "Dinner will be at sundown, I invite you both to join us, please," he said, smiling again. Star nodded back, then moved to Ellesandra, ready to move out the door and go walk around for a while on their day off following their heroic rescue. Though, once the two did move out of the home and the door was closed, Star abruptly turned to pull Ellesandra into a hug. "...Thank you, Ellesandra." The sharing of physical emotions that came with physical contact of course came along with this, and within Star's heart there was...Overwhelming gratitude, all of it for Ellesandra.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked at Star with confusion when Star giggled in regards to Lissanna speaking with animals. She wasn't quite sure what was funny about that, looking back at Lissana, before shrugging and following Star out the door. She had started to turn to Star to see if there was anywhere in particular the mage wanted to go when she felt Star abruptly pull her into a hug. Ellesandra froze, statue still. Her arms were out to the side like someone who had gotten hugged and been surprised by it, and she was looking at Star with wide eyes. The feeling of Star's appreciation, gratitude flooded her and kept her rooted to the spot, and it took her a moment to realize what was happening and recover from her shock. When she did, the barrier on her emotions that she'd worked at maintaining all day yesterday, while carrying Star, slammed back in place to prevent Star's emotions from piling in and calming her again. She took a deep breath and lightly wrapped one arm around Star, patting her back in the awkward 'there there' motion of anyone who was unused to physical touch like this. "...Come on." She said, motioning with her head down the path for them to begin their exploration of the area. She felt awkward and confused with Star hugging her, and she could feel the way it caused her heart to skip a beat and the guilt and grief that began to stir much further down. She didn't want the hug to continue, but she didn't push Star away, either.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a small worry in Star's heart that she might get pushed away. The worry would pass along, though the reason for it would remain nebulous to the knight. Just another emotion in the chaotic storm of emotion that they were exposed to when touching Star. A storm that would be difficult to unravel for even someone well versed in their own emotions, so for Ellesandra? It all remained a confusing mystery until it was blocked off. Curiously, the act of drawing the division was easier on this day. It appeared to be a skill one could hone as they grew more familiar with Star's magic. A skill that would allow them to either better make sense of the chaos and noise in her emotions, or to block her out more completely. Control, in essence, was afforded with exposure. Marginal for now, but noticeable. Ultimately, Star held the hug for a short while, concluding it with a gentle squeeze, and parted with a smile. Star obviously could tell that it was difficult for Ellesandra. The discomfort, as if a hug was alien to them, had Star wearing sympathy and understanding upon her features as hands daintily folded behind her back. "...For staying," she began. "For walking beside me, instead of continuing on your own path." She then wore a brighter, happier, slightly playful smile. "...And for the blueberries." A giggle followed. "I guess it's pretty obvious how they are my favourite, isn't it? You probably felt like it was nothing. But in both the small and big moments, I have seen nothing but kindness in you. And it makes me really happy to know you." She let those words linger for a moment, hanging in the air. She debated speaking in terms Ellesandra understood, in saying her piece and then abruptly changing the subject to deter the other person from saying anything about it. On one hand, she considered that a kindness for the knight, to not force them to face the genuine emotion in Star's words. But on the other, she feared that saying what she had, and then immediately setting off to wander around like nothing happened would stifle Ellesandra further and reinforce the notion that emotions weren't a conversation, but just a series of random statements said at will and not to be discussed further. So, she elected to leave the silence to linger, so Ellesandra could decide how they wished to respond. She expected them to just clear their throat and pick a direction to start walking, and if that is what happened, she would be fine with it. But on the small chance Ellesandra had a response, Star didn't want to take away their chance to say it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pursed her lips together, eyeing Star when she finally pulled back with that gentle squeeze. There was part of her that immediately missed the contact. The part of her that had been touch starved for years now, having little to no real physical contact with people. Even when she'd taken lovers the past few years, it had been her touching them - not much of the other way around. The thought was pushed out of their mind and Ellesandra turned to look down the path, not meeting Star's eyes at all the thanks, and the comment about her kindness. She took the desire to be touched again and shoved it down, letting that discomfort with the whole situation be the main emotion Star would see - or at least, that's what she tried to do. She had no idea how much Star could see, or if other large emotions blocked sight to the smaller ones. "Yes, well." She said, clearing her throat awkwardly. Changing her plan for the money Morrun gave her for them both, she reached for the pouch that had it and unhooked it, tossing it over to Star. "I've been paid for my services, and part of that is making sure my client is happy. If blueberries make you happy, it is my duty to provide." It was a cop out. A guise to hide behind, in that her kindness or actually wanting to protect Star wasn't true, but just the job and the duty expected of her. Hiding behind duty was easy, even if a five year old could see through the lie. As the one hiding, it helped ease Ellesandra's emotions to think of it this way. "Morrun paid us for the rescue. I took my pay, the rest is yours to use." This also wasn't true. She hadn't taken but one platinum out of there, to use for her inn room last night and to test to ensure that the coin was good. Of course the platinum had been overpaying and she'd gotten change in gold but still. Ellesandra didn't even consider how easy it was for Star to tell she was lying, that thought not even being a consideration as she began walking away from Morrun's house, choosing that moment to go with the 'end the conversation and walk' path. "Lets go see the sights, it's not every day you get to roam an elven settlement."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had a bit of a fumbling reaction to catching the coin purse. Her hands were behind her when it was thrown at her after all, but she did catch it. She frowned, looking at the coin in the bag. Then went wide-eyed. That was...A lot of money. It became quite a bit less so when dealing in magical items which could gobble up the wealth for just a few modestly useful things, or even all on one single thing of modest value or rarity. She then looked at the house Morrun and Lissana owned. Guild began to rise in her own self. Not something Ellesandra would be able to see on her aura, but certainly on her face. Of course, the only thing she could think of with this is how much it could improve the lives of the elven couple. "I'll take a few coins and return the rest, then, since you've taken your pay," she said aloud, quite thoroughly justifying Morrun's intuition to pay Ellesandra. Goodness knew that what Star 'needed' was a paltry sum out of the pile. Five coins maybe. And not that Star knew it, but doing so would certainly expose Ellesandra's lie about taking their pay. And that didn't even begin to touch upon the way Star looked at Ellesandra after this statement with a face that clearly said 'if you're going to lie to me at least make it convincing' as she considered the cop-out line about blueberries. It was almost enough to get Star to lash out at them. But she'd only known Ellesandra a day. She feared being too insistent on the matters of emotion, about insisting on honesty, would push them away. She had, less than an hour ago, learned that Ellesandra was staying with her until she concluded her mission. A promise that...She wasn't sure Ellesandra fully understood, given how long Star had been at this already. But one she desperately needed. So she swallowed her emotions and simply said, as Ellesandra was walking away: "...There is no mountain." She then drew in a deep breath, huffed through her nose, and turned to catch up with the knight. Curiously, the pouch of coins was nowhere to be seen. Star also didn't carry a pack, as Ellesandra would have noticed while they were moving from Cloverport to the elven settlement. Did she lose it? Where were her supplies? Did she toss the coins into Morrun's home when Ellesandra wasn't looking? She just had her dress, as if that were her only possession. That all aside, she walked beside the knight in their plainclothes. The settlement was of decent size, but more vertically sprawling than horizontally so. The exploration revealed a fair amount of services the elves had; a smithy with a few workers, several bakers, artisans, a small library, a small prison, and a handful of other sorts. There didn't seem to be any sort of tavern or analogue for it, though there was a shop selling fine elven wines, some aged upwards of fifty, even a hundred years if the two poked their head in to peruse the wares. It was decidedly civilian, with enough similarity to human settlements to make it feel familiar. Beyond the services, however, there were communal spaces for the elves to gather. Places for them to be together, be merry, to sing and to dance, places to hone their accuracy with bows and form with blades. A place for the children to learn and be safe. The occasional elf regarded the two humans walking among them with curiosity. Another, with knit brows. Racial lines did breed strife on occasion, but as Morrun promised, there was no overt hostility. A few hours passed as they traveled around, taking in the sights and sounds, though it all carried a familiarity that prevented anything from standing out enough to linger on. They were just finding ways to idle the hours away, it seemed. That was until they found their way to the far side of the settlement, which had a bountiful garden to behold. Star's eyes went wide, and she sped along ahead of Ellesandra to step onto the walking path laid out with mosaic stones that passed between two rows of flowerbeds that were adorned with flowers and flora of all colours and sorts. Rainbows of blooms arranged with careful precision that sought perfection in the craft. The stone path led forward onto an open, grassy field that had patches of flowers dotting the greenery. It was a beautiful meadow, one that Star giggled with glee as she ran into, did a pleasant, happy spin on one leg, then let herself fall onto her back onto the soft earth. The sun glittered down onto the meadow, casting god rays through the trees to illuminate it in its warm glow. Some other elves were in the distance in this large meadow, keeping to themselves and simply living among nature. But at least for the moment, Star was occupying a little slice of the meadow to herself, obviously elated by the natural beauty on display.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned at Star's comment about returning the rest. "Take at least half. If nothing else you can find uses to donate it to on the journey." The request was made as more of a suggestion. She would prefer Star have the funds necessary to ensure safe travels, though also knew that Star would want to use the money for other kind acts in the future. She could spread that out, leaving some for the elven couple and then using it on the road as well. The no mountain comment made her visibly flinch. Her teeth gritted and anger rose, anger and denial swirling around the mountain that was obviously there, even if hidden and ignored by Ellesandra herself. This made the first part of their journey through the town not very pleasant for Ellesandra, working to rein in said anger and focusing more on that than enjoying the sights around them. The smell of the bakery got her attention, that and the smithy were the main things Ellesandra was looking at when not doing base scans for danger. Despite this being essentially a day off for them, she was still with her charge and thus needed to ensure no surprises were waiting. Ellesandra was quiet on the little tour of the town, impressed with the way they integrated their entire culture into nature but otherwise it seemed just like any other town. When they made it to the gardens and the meadow, she was taken aback by how much Star seemed to enjoy it. Running forward and spinning in the fields, Ellesandra found herself watching the just pure unfiltered joy in star with envy. She didn't remember the last time she'd been able to feel joy like that. A sinking feeling sat in her chest again, one she couldn't identify. Loneliness and regret was there, but it had been long enough that Ellesandra let herself feel either in this context that she didn't even realize what it was. Instead, she found a bench or a stump or something to sit on and settled down, watching Star just laying back in the meadow for a moment, before glancing around to see if there was anyone else around they might be disturbing. Keeping guard, like normal, with the same stoic expression as always despite the aforementioned feelings getting stronger.

Star hadn't seemed too keen on the idea of taking half. As kind as Star was, she had moments of being stubborn. The coin bag was gone, either way. Star literally could not help noticing the anger, but she didn't speak to it. She did think on it, however. And happy as she was, there was a desire to share it with her dutiful knight. Sure, it was possible there was danger, but they had been assured this place was safe. And it wasn't like Ellesandra was in their armor right now. Not that she'd want to take them on in a fist fight regardless, and felt pity for anyone who tried, but there was a mild poutiness about Star with how Ellesandra didn't have an off switch. "Hey, Ellesandra, get off your stump and come lay in the grass with me!" she called out, briefly propped up on her arms. She pat the grass next to her, then smiled. "It's a beautiful day!"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had sat on the stump just as much to keep distance from Star as to keep an eye out. Yet when Star propped up on her arms to invite her out, Ellesandra stared at her with a mixture of confusion and amusement. Why did Star want her to spend time with her like this? Ellesandra had proven to be a grumpy, unfun person so far hadn't she? Yet Star continued to try to pull her in. She didn't answer for a moment, watching Star and then glancing around the fields, before sighing in acceptance and standing. "As you wish, Miss Lumina." She could still hide behind the job, doing what her client wanted, in the form of her acceptance here. She walked forward, careful not to crush any of the flowers in the meadow - or as careful as she could be, anyways. She turned and lowered herself to sit next to Star's laying form. She didn't lay down, but did lean back on her own elbows, looking up at the sky rather than at Star next to her. "It is a beautiful day." She relented, agreeing with the comment.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star paid particular attention to how Ellesandra didn't trample the flowers. It made her smile, though from the knight's point of view she was just smiling because, well, Star did smile a lot. She was a happy person, generally. Until something sad happened. Then she was sad. As if she had some sort of empathetic magic or something. But she did happily welcome the other to her side. She knew touching them was...Not the knight's favourite activity, so she refrained from helping herself to using their lap as a pillow, despite the urge. Instead, she laid back, hands resting over her abdomen. "You can just call me Star, you know. I keep waffling about matching your formality and using your last name and saying that's silly and just using your first name. I've decided to just use your first name. So you should do the same." She smiled. "My mom gave it to me, after all. Picked it specifically for me. Be awfully rude not to make use of it, don't'cha think?" she asked with a playful voice, looking up at her companion. It was flimsy logic, but she clearly knew as much and just wanted to be called by her first name regardless.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a sudden pain that rose in Ellesandra's emotions at the mention of Star's mother giving her her name. It was enough that Ellesandra actually showed a response on her face, eyebrows coming together and her mouth creasing into a frown. She still didn't look at Star, remaining in her position until it became uncomfortable on her arms, and then leaning back entirely to lay down in the grass. She wasn't quite sure how to respond at first, wanting to decline Star's invitation to use her first name, but not knowing how to do so without insulting or offending the woman - or her mother, considering what Star had just said. So instead she pushed the memories of her childhood back down so the pain wasn't up front again, and nodded. "As you wish, Star." Her words were a whisper. A gentle give to the formality that normally was insisted upon to keep an appropriate distance between her and a client; something that she couldn't find she could enforce with Star. Star just had too much positive energy and happiness to deny her something so simple. She took a moment to glance around, not letting her guard down despite laying in the grass with Star, before looking back up to the sky. "Must be beautiful here at night, with the stars." A topic change. Still something more than she normally would have commented on, but it was a give and take. Give that, prevent questioning into the pain that she knew Star probably saw at the mention of a mother giving a child their name. Just another part of that mountain which didn't exist.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was smiling at first, but then frowned when she saw Ellesandra do the same. She had touched something there, hadn't she? She couldn't know, of course. Only know the other woman's hurt. She knew the knight's game by now. Every comment was calculated. It was a difficult topic to broach...She still didn't want to risk pushing the other woman away with inquisition. So she went along, this time. She would have to choose her moment, if she ever intended to try and chip away at the cold armor on Ellesandra's heart. "It's what I was named after. My mother's name is Aurora. My grandmother was Luna. Great grandmother, Aelia., which means 'sun'. My home has a lot of connection with the celestial bodies. The beauty and mystic grace of it all...My mother told me of how it is the destiny of my family line to bring light into the lives of others. She told me a story of how a single, guiding, bright star in the sky guided her to the woman she'd eventually come to marry. My...Other mother, Robin, didn't survive until I was born, I know that much. But my mom, Aurora...She said that I was that star that guided her, and descended from the heavens to be with her once I did." She giggled, tears having formed in her eyes. She was smiling, but...It was clearly painful to talk about, given the situation. "So every time I look up at the stars, I make sure to look for any bright ones. See if maybe there's something up there trying to guide me." She sniffled. "I know it sounds silly. But since we'll be here for the rest of the day...Let's come back here to look at the stars tonight, once the sun sets. See how beautiful it really is."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over at Star when she heard the sniffle. She eyed the water building in Star's eyes, and without a word slid her hand into a pocket and pulled out a handkerchief. It was silver with gold threaded emboss on it, of the same type of designs as was on her armor. There were initials on it, M.K., in the center. It looked relatively fancy, especially for something that the knight would be carrying around. She handed it over to Star to use to help dry her eyes before looking back up to the sky. "That's a lovely story." The response seemed...well, Ellesandra had more to say, there was more that she could say, but she didn't. It was all withheld, restrained. Instead, Ellesandra leaned her head back into the grass with a deep sigh, closing her eyes. "Returning tonight sounds like a great idea." They could probably return after having dinner with Morrun and Lissana, since they'd been invited there. Ellesandra wasn't sure about imposing on their hospitality more, but it seemed like it would be rude to refuse. Even if she was staying in the Inn rather than their place, with all her stuff still back in her room at the Inn, refusing their food seemed unnecessary. "Have you found any bright stars up there, guiding you?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
If Star didn't have the intuition to know that Ellesandra felt more than they let on, she might be offended by the curt response to her story. She accepted the handkerchief and did use it to dry her eyes, then admired the stitching on it. She sniffled again. "This is...Really nice," she said, taking note of the initials. M.K...Unless Ellesandra had a completely different name, it wasn't theirs. So...Who did it belong to? Whatever the case, it was important enough to keep, so Star would not dare sully it with anything more than a few teardrops. She held it gently, with a clear reverence, as if she implicitly knew it was very important to the knight at her side. Not much could get past her in that regard, after all. So it was handed back with care once she was done with it. Even if her eyes were still a bit wet, she dare not use it more. Then, the later question evoked a small nod. "I did, once. It led me to Nina. She's been a very good friend over the years, and that's a story you might find familiar, as I found her in the midst of peril and saved her. She's returned the favour plenty over the years I've known her. And she found love, or at least...For a while, she did." Star shook her head. More to the story, clearly, but not important enough to get into. "Of course I know it's just a silly coincidence. But there's something to be said about it happening twice. Maybe it'll happen again. Maybe it'll happen enough times that I'll have a much harder time just believing it coincidence."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The comment about the handkerchief being nice was ignored, at least verbally. Ellesandra obviously heard it because the grief, and the guilt, all hidden beneath the large mountain of repression Ellesandra had, leaked out a little. Marigolds handkerchief was the only physical thing Ellesandra had left of her, so yes it was quite important to her. She kept the conversation going beyond that though, ensuring that her talent at avoiding those conversations didn't go unused. She glanced over at Star, curious as the story was told. She wasn't certain, but she'd gotten the impression Star and this Nina might have been involved themselves, at least as much as you might with a travelling companion in a friends with benefits way. The indication that Nina had found love, at least for a time, made Ellesandra curious how Star felt about that. She didn't ask though; it wasn't Ellesandra's place to ask probing questions when she herself would refuse to answer any similar ones. "Maybe it will. Even if it doesn't happen again, doesn't mean that it was coincidence. The gods and goddesses work in weird ways, and with how your entire family seems to be named after and related to the stars or celestial bodies in some way, I wouldn't put it past the appropriate Deities finding favor within your family and sending you messages that way. Or just playing around with you."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The confirmation that the handkerchief was important came not from a physical tell, but, as was often with Star, an emotional one. Good that she was careful with it. A rag, she might have blown her nose on. Never would she dare use that precious keepsake for anything in the future, even dabbing her eyes. She sniffled again, then giggled. "I would hope they aren't playing around with me, if that is the case," she said, then looked back up to the skies. "...Have you ever had anything like that, Ellesandra? Anything that seemed to be like a coincidence? I mean...Other than you stumbling across me being in danger, of course. I have to wonder how much fate had a hand in that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged. "It's luck, or it's fated by the gods. And I don't much care for putting my life and my destiny in the hands of the gods; spiteful prideful beings who would use people like us and then throw us away. So there have been times that I've been lucky; I've gotten very luck in my life time, being able to be trained where I was and accepted into their ranks." Her comment was offhand, vague enough that Star wouldn't be able to get too much detail from it, but it would be obvious from her that what Ellesandra mentioned was something that she'd been grateful for, at the time. She still felt grateful, for whatever she was referencing, even if there was still pain in the memory. She waved her hand, dismissing the notion and idea. "Things happen, if they're fated then no point in fighting that, but if they're not then I'm going to make my own decisions and let luck and coincidence fall where it may."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star listened quietly, keeping an eye on the woman for their emotions as the story went on. Gratitude was a nice emotion to see. It had her smiling, though she could only imagine that such gratitude came from an upbringing that was more destitute. A person born in privilege feels they deserve everything they get, after all. She didn't mention this, but she made the quiet assumption to be confirmed some other time. "Quite the pragmatic view on it all. I've never been particularly pious, so I don't have much to say for or against the notion of the gods. I'll just have to take your word at their dispositions." There was an odd disconnect about bad stuff being gods and good stuff being luck, but again, she didn't say anything. "It's not surprising that you are someone who seeks to take control of their own destiny, though." She smiled. "We have that in common. I like that about you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra knew gods could bring about good stuff, too. They just hadn't for her, and it wasn't dependable. You could make your own good stuff. Most of what she'd seen the gods do had been negative, in some form of fashion. Not that she had much interaction with it at all, anyways, she was just biased. At the last comment, Ellesandra finally looked back over to Star and raised her eyebrows at her. "Take control of your own destiny? Didn't you just say that you were looking for a star that a deity would use to guide you to your next...I don't know. Lover, if that's what happened for your ancestors, or just friend?" She sounded amused a little. Maybe poking fun at Star, but only lightly and not seriously. Testing boundaries, more like, as she looked back up at the sky. "What do you have planned when you find your mother?" When, not if. She believed Star would find her mother, though if she was dead it might not be in the way Star wanted to find her. There was curiosity about how they got separated anyways, but again not something that Ellesandra was going to pry into.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was smiling bright as the two talked. It felt like for perhaps the first time, she was holding a conversation with Ellesandra that was about them, not just the situation they were in. Even at the subject of her mother, she didn't lose her smile. She giggled at the light prodding. "Just because I seek guidance where it might present itself doesn't mean I am not fighting for what I desire. I think I've proven that I'm not averse to taking risks. I think you'd be a lot less stressed out being near me if I was," she said, prodding back to the woman with a playful smile and lilt to her voice. "And, well...I've never been in love. Not aside from love for family, of course. Romantic love." She was still a virgin, but she wasn't about to go saying that out loud. "And not for lack of meeting people, mind. Maybe it's just the vagrancy, but...I've never felt that way about anyone before. I've felt...Attraction, certainly. Enough to know what kind of people I'm attracted to, though that's always been kept inside. Never uh...Told someone I, you know...N-Never mind. But I'll always take more friends. Making friends wherever I go is how I like it to be. As for my mother? Well....Depends on if she is alive of dead I guess. If she's gone, then I will just need to make sure I care for her legacy, and that she is properly set to rest. If she's alive...Then I never want to be separated from her again. N-Not, you know...Like live with her or something. Just make sure that I can see her regularly. Learn from her. Understand myself better," she said, looking down at herself as she did. A pensive introspection overtook her. "...You can't really know what it's like to be born like me, of course. I've had this gift since birth. Mom helped me understand it, but there was a lot I had to figure out on my own, too. It's...An intuitive thing. Not something that you can really explain. But certain things just click after you focus on them for a while. At first, I remember reading an aura was really hard. Just a...Chaotic barrage of emotions constantly. Lots of headaches, and trying to make sense of things that rejected understanding." An apt description of what Ellesandra felt, to a very mild degree, whenever touching Star as the power connected their auras. Confusing, despite the comfort. "But over time, little by little, having experiences with people helped me understand them, and understand me by extension. I've been lucky, too. Lucky that a lot of people have helped me, yourself certainly included. So...On one hand it's a little selfish of me, as my mother is the only person who can really help me with this in a way that isn't just me figuring it out myself. But that aside?" She closed her eyes. "...She's my mother. I love her. And she loves me. I know she would come for me, if she could. So either she is out there looking for me, and we haven't found each other...She's dead, and can't look for me...Or she needs help. Whatever the reason, I have to find her and know for sure. It's..." She paused, pursing her lips as her eyes opened again. "...Have you ever felt like...You can't move on with your life? Like something holds you back from doing that? For me, that's...This. I need this. Then...Then I can think about settling down and having a life that is more about me. And I hope to help a lot of people out along the way."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra listened as Star rambled about her lack of being in love, and her interactions with people as that. It caused her to raise her eyes again, but it was more curiosity as to why or how, and not judgment at Star's inexperience with love. It sounded like she might not have told someone she was attracted to them, either, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. It certainly wasn't her place to pry into how many people Star had been with, sexually. She was silent as Star transitioned into speaking about her mother, and what she'd do when finding her, and her powers. When Star asked that of her, though, she reached to the side and picked a single flower, holding it up above her head and slowly curling the stem round and round itself, up the stem until it created a much smaller stem that was stronger, but obviously different from how it had started. It curved to the side instead of going straight down, and Ellesandra picked another flower, curling it's stem around the first. She was making a circlet of flowers, though it would take quite a few more than just two, and she wasn't in a rush to complete it as they lie there. The silence stretched, the unspoken mountain rumbling with the pain, grief and guilt over what Ellesandra herself couldn't move past - what was holding her back. Her eyes were focused on the flowers in front of her as she worked, but the whispered words came out. So softly that Star might wonder if she'd imagined them. "There is no mountain." She clenched her jaw again, and suddenly crushed the start of the circlet in her fist, tossing it to the side and sitting up, back to where Star was laying. "You take risks like what you took for Morrun and Lissana, and you very well might not make it to finding your mother." Now her words were scolding, a defensiveness for the little she'd just opened up in and slammed that look into her emotions back down again, overcorrecting. "So don't let your helping others distract you from finding your mother, if you want to actually do so."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was quietly smiling as she saw Ellesandra weaving a circlet of flowers. It was cute. Though, she watched as the tranquility, brief as it was, was overtaken by defensive anger, frustration, and a myriad of other emotions swirling in the knight's aura. The flowers were crushed and the woman was defensively faced away from her. The words that followed didn't hurt Star, like they might have been meant to. She kept calm in the face of them. "I know," she said quietly. "But I...Like who I am. Not that I don't have my failings, of course. I've plenty of those. But I like...That I am not afraid of dying for a good cause. Obviously I'll try to do all I can to avoid that and...I know I have no business flinging myself at something I have no hope of surviving. I pick the fights I know I can take, even if I recognize I might get hurt along the way. Knowing what would have happened to Lissana if we hadn't intervened...I'd make the same decision a million out of a million times. There's...Enough suffering in this world that I am forced to turn a blind eye to. So...As much as I'm able to," she said, moving from laying to being on her knees. She then moved behind Ellesandra and, with as gentle a motion as she could, embraced the other woman from behind, looping her arms around their neck to hug their shoulders and collar. "I want to give people their smiles back when something has taken it away from them. I'm no miracle worker, but...It's a promise I keep to myself, that I will always do everything that I can." With that, she didn't wish to overstay her welcome. A small squeeze, then slowly retreated from Ellesandra, unless she saw reason to keep the hold.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't look at Star, even as the mage seemed to brush off her words. Her knees came up and she wrapped her arms around them, leaning forward away from her and staring out over the meadow. Her rapier was at her side, awkwardly putting pressure against her hip from the way it angled against the ground, but she didn't bother repositioning it. In a way, the discomfort that brought helped ground her. The thought came into her mind, that even if Star was willing to risk her own life for it, she might not understand how her death effected others too. She didn't say it, because it wasn't really Star who Ellesandra would be saying that too. It wasn't really Star that she was thinking it about. The grief bubbled up, enough that she'd been distracted to the point of not expecting Star's touch. The embrace caused her to jump, both physically and emotionally surprised at the touch. The calmness wasn't welcome right now and she pulled away, moving to stand as if she had been planning to do that the entire time and lightly pulling Star's hands off of her even in that quick squeeze. She took a few steps away and then stopped, unsure what to say. She was being dramatic, wasn't she? Shame, but she really didn't like how her emotions went haywire when around Star. And how when Star touched her, she was afraid Star would be able to see the memories associated with those emotions. Without a word, she returned to her stump, hiding behind her 'duty' again, and looking anywhere around them except at Star herself. She withheld the tears that were on the verge of springing to her eyes, but at the same time she knew that didn't matter with Star. Star would see the grief anyways, and that angered her. She couldn't even hide the emotions from the woman like she could everyone else, to get them to think she was just being moody and leave her alone.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Indeed, Star had to find a balance between respecting Ellesandra's boundaries and not allowing the obvious grief and anguish to go unanswered. That mountain was looking a whole lot more existent right now. She had been given a clear signal by them pulling away, but something...Beckoned Star to keep at it. She was confident Ellesandra wasn't going to hurt her, of course. She worried about losing their allyship, but...If she was willing to risk her own life for a stranger, she was willing to do at least as much for someone she had come to care about as a friend. So she followed to the stump. She sat, cross-legged, in front of Ellesandra, looking up at them. She didn't say anything for the moment. She just looked at them. Of course, Ellesandra knew that her looking at someone was almost always her looking at them.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected Star to follow her. Her lips pressed together in a firm line, frustration and irritation at Star's silent insistence. She knew Star wasn't just looking at her, was waiting for her to open up, or to be able to see and understand more about her emotions. "Stop it." The thought of Star staring at the emotions that she didn't even want to feel right now bothered her - a lot. Her feet came up to rest on the edge of the stump and her knees pressed to her chest, as if somehow putting her legs between herself and Star would prevent Star from seeing into her as well. It was ridiculous, but the instinct to protect and cover herself was still there. She felt naked, exposed beneath Star's gaze and it was not something she was comfortable with right now. "I'm not going to talk about it, either." She added this, knowing that even if Star looked away, she might try to bring the topic up. Ellesandra found she still couldn't actually look down and meet Star's gaze. Instead, she held onto her knees and looked out over the field, the grief slowly being pushed down by the irritation and anger. Okay, maybe Star pushing it was good; it helped her focus on those emotions rather than the grief.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I'm not asking you to talk about the mountain that isn't there," she said, undeterred by Ellesandra's emotional response. "I just want to talk to you. I was enjoying that," she said, her words as honest-to-a-fault as ever. "If you insist that I leave you be I will but not until you listen to me." There was a firmness to her voice, one that spoke of emotional conviction. But she was still being gentle. She didn't want to actively anger the woman of course. But some emotional grit was to be expected with such a sensitive topic. "You decided to help me. You saved me from coming out of that a lot worse than I would have. Maybe even saved my life if things went terribly wrong. You stuck by me, and each time I was ready to let go of you, to not impose on you, you stayed beside me. Despite both of us knowing the dangers we were up against, you even stood by me as I pledged to help a man who was at the time a total stranger to us both. And from the moment I laid eyes on you I have seen..." She paused. "...You know what I've seen. And I'm still not going to press you on that, as much as it makes my heart bleed to pretend I don't see it. I know I don't afford the privacy of emotion that many are used to. I know it's hard to know someone sees it. But it's just as hard to be someone who sees someone so kind suffer. And before you try to hide behind some sort of honour that forces you to be the way you are, just...Remember what I see. Remember that I see through lies of even adept liars and...As kind as I can possibly say it, you're not a very good liar," she said, offering a smile at that. Her words might have conviction to them, but she did her best to remain gentle. "So I'm...Not asking you to confide in me, not asking you to spill secrets to me. I'm just asking you to...Hear me when I tell you it's hard to fight against every fiber of my heart that begs me to see what's right in front me, but I do it because you asked me to. But I have to draw the line, Ellesandra. When it gets to be too much, I...Don't need you to open up about it. I just want to be able to support you. We can talk about anything else, if it helps. Because it just...Isn't fair that you can be there for me, constantly, when I need you, which has been far more times in one day than I care to admit...And I'm not allowed to do anything at all for you in return. You went and stepped into my life and now you've got me caring about you. And if I'm willing to risk my life for a stranger, just imagine what I'll do for a friend, let alone one who saved my life." She looked at Ellesandra, pleading with her eyes. "...Just let me be here with you and talk about...Birds, or flowers...Anything."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned. The mountain wasn't there, but Star kept mentioning it. To be fair, Ellesandra mentioned it just a few moments ago, too. With a deep breath, she put her chin on the top of her knees and closed her eyes, hearing the firmness of Star's voice. She wouldn't give this up, and pushing back would either start an argument or Ellesandra would have to simply walk away. And if she walked away, what would happen to Star? She wouldn't be able to live with herself if something happened to the mage that Ellesandra could have stopped, but she just walked away because being in Star's presence was hard. The dream came back to her and irritation rose in her once again. It took a few moments, and honestly with the words that Star cared about her making it easier, Ellesandra calmed herself down. She resigned herself to having to deal with Star knowing that she hurt, but she didn't need to know why. "Fine. You can see it, but the topic is off limits. That is a firm boundary, Mi-...Star. You will not pry, or try to trick me into talking about things that I have no desire to relive or discuss." She opened her eyes, looking back down to Star. These weren't requests. They were clear statements that if Star didn't think she could follow, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could travel alongside the mage. Regret and fear came up at that, worried that Star would refuse and Ellesandra might be forced to face the dream she'd had again. The guilt at someone dying because of her inaction. "And give me the handkerchief back, if you're done with it." Ellesandra hadn't forgotten it. She didn't care if Star's tears or even snot was on it; she'd clean it the next opportunity she had, but she didn't want to let Star just keep it for now. Especially not with the tension between them and the current irritation at Ellesandra feeling like that mountain, which she always pretended wasn't there, kept getting poked by Star's comments, brought back to life, and Ellesandra was not prepared for the emotional onslaught that would be once she stopped repressing it entirely.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star blinked, looking at her hand to find she was holding onto it. "Oh, erm...S-Sorry. I meant to give it back," she said, handing it back. It only had two tiny tear spots on it which were mostly dry. She heard the 'Mi', and upon handing the handkerchief back, was reminded of the initials. Was she...Being associated with someone from Ellesandra's past? She couldn't know. And she wouldn't ask. "Ellesandra...I said right when we got onto the road together that I wasn't going to press you on this. Do I...Want to know? Of course. But I'm not going to force you. Being who I am, I've had to learn when it is appropriate to...Make use of the knowledge I have from the power. I'm not perfect of course but...I at least have tact enough that if someone says they don't want to talk about something...All I can do is just say...I'm here, if they change their mind. And that I do want to help. But that's all I can do. And I would hope it had gone without saying but...I'll say it so you can hear it: I'm not going to trick you. I'm not going to mislead you, lie to you, intentionally lead you along some conversation path hoping you'll slip and tell me something you don't want to talk about..." She shook her head. "If you ever, ever feel comfortable talking about whatever it is...I want it to be genuine. I want it to be only because you want to share with me, and no other reason. It would make feel sick if you ever felt I was...Manipulating you. I told you I...Only ever will be honest with you. Even if the truth isn't pleasant, or what you want to hear. It will always be the truth, and I will always hold the best intentions towards you. I swear this, all of it."

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She took the handkerchief back. A second was taken, running her thumb across the initials, before she folded it up neatly and slipped it back into her pocket. The grief and guilt, so intertwined, threatened to rise again. They were pushed down and she folded the handkerchief up, putting it back in her pocket and moving to sit up right on the stump again, feet on the ground once more. "Good." It was the only thing Star would get in response to all of her confirmation and reassurance that she wouldn't pry. That she wouldn't try to manipulate or trick information out of Ellesandra. Ellesandra was uncomfortable with Star being able to see her emotions, but there wasn't anything she could do about that. Setting this boundary, verbally and getting agreement on it rather than just assuming Star was too good of a person to push on it, was important for her. She looked down at Star for a moment, then stood. "Lets continue walking." She needed to get away from where they just were, where she'd felt so raw there for a moment. Whether or not Star followed, Ellesandra moved back onto the path and began just walking alongside the meadow, not necessarily leaving it but not going to lay back down in the flowers, either. Movement felt needed, to help process and distract herself, so that's what she was doing. "So, recap our next destination and travel plans for me, assuming you are fully recovered tomorrow and good to start the journey?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star loosed a soft breath, glad that they reached an agreement. She obviously could tell there was more pain lingering, but all she asked was that they keep together and not fall silent. She got at least that much, made clear as they got up. She joined them, walking alongside. The question had her recounting the details. "I'll be having Morrun mark my map with where we'll be going. It'll be about two days of walking north, hopefully without any major issues. From there, we need to find details, clues. Find some information about these people Morrun said he saw, who come from Myst. Or in general just...Get to Myst, however we can. From Myst, he believes we can get to my home again. Once we're in my home...There will be a lot of work to do to find out what happened, starting with the...Ruins of what was once my home."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"Ruins of what it once was? What happened to it?" Ellesandra led them on a path that seemed to run alongside this meadow for a while, but when they got to the end of it, she turned around and began walking back down it. The meadow was beautiful, and Star had obviously enjoyed it, so she didn't want to just walk away and prevent the feel of the nature and the environment from being enjoyed. She needed to move, but no reason it couldn't just be along this path. A glance was given over to Star at the question, but she didn't push. Just like she'd requested of Star, if that type of information was painful for her or she didn't want to discuss it, who was Ellesandra to push on it?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Unlike Ellesandra, Star was an open book to her companion. She wore a smile, but it was...A sorrowful one. "It's how I got separated from my mother in the first place. We were attacked. My mother was known in our region as a powerful magic user, and I was a little too young at the time to really understand it all, but...I think it's fair to say that she attracted some powerful enemies. My mother ran with me, we tried to escape as the other magi held off the attack. But they pursued. Laid waste. Razed our village. I remember flames and blood falling from the sky." She paused here, looking over the beauty of the natural land as she kept walking with her companion. "I remember seeing the fear in my mother, in her aura. She was the strongest, so...She had to fight. But she also had to guard me. The choice of being idle and protecting me, or going out and saving anyone she could from our village. Those are the conflicting emotions I remember seeing in her. I told her to send me away, for her enemies did not know she bore a daughter. It was the only way she could protect me, for if she fought and died, or the enemy retreated with knowledge of me, I would always be in danger from them." She closed her eyes for a moment, holding down her sorrow. Then opened them again. "So she did. She opened a gate and sent me through it. It was a plan made in the moment. She sent me far, far away, and I had...Hoped she would be able to follow me afterwards." Her voice was starting to get a bit stiff, a bit choked. "But a day turned into a week, which turned into a month, then two, then six, then a year, two, five, ten..." She shuddered, closing her eyes tight. Tears streaked down her cheeks. "I don't want her to be dead, Ellesandra...I don't. I don't want her to have died fighting for us all. I don't want to have to regret not begging her to come with me, even knowing the evils would have followed her." She choked a sob. "...So please do not warn me of what I already know...That the enemy may be waiting for me there. I need to do this. With all that I am, I need to return to her side. And I need to pray with all that I am that she still lives..."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected all of...that. When she'd heard the first choking noise, she stopped, turning to look at Star. Regret filled her, at asking this question and making Star relive this. She shouldn't have, and as she saw how much it effected Star, she couldn't help but try to fix it. The thing is, she didn't know how to. She looked around, as if suddenly, magically, someone else would appear to comfort Star. To say the right thing, and make her feel better. She'd never been good at this, not even before the mountain was there. Looking back to Star she wavered for a moment, and then stepped forward. She had her barrier in place, to try her best to block the sorrow that was evident in Star's face from hitting her at the touch, but she would offer her arms for Star if she wanted the hug. She did not touch Star first, though. She made the offer and indication apparent, arms spread and ready to wrap around Star if she decided to lean into the embrace, but she knew enough about Star's ability by now that she wouldn't touch Star without her permission in this situation. It may not be an emotion Star wanted to share, and even if Ellesandra was guarding against it, with something this strong could she not feel it at all? Her face was conflicted, and there was definite hesitation in the offer, but if Star needed a shoulder to cry on, Ellesandra would be it. "I won't warn you." Ellesandra said, even though she had thought that. "No matter what is waiting there or not, we will find it and see what happened to your mother." If Star did accept the embrace, she would wrap her arms around the mage and guide her head onto her shoulder, lightly squeezing. Awkward, but still supportive.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra might be the sort to be hesitant to physical touch, but Star was the complete opposite. The moment a hug was offered, she went flush against them, the comfort evident as her aura connected to Ellesandra. The raw sorrow was there. But it was an emotion Ellesandra could know was not their own. Putting up a barrier kept some of it out, but it was too powerful to avoid the sensation entirely. It did not evoke sadness in Ellesandra specifically. But just with all the other emotions, it was there, able to be reached out to. It was quite like seeing Star cry, except it was Ellesandra's heart, the core of their emotion, 'seeing' Star's sadness. It was a visceral feeling. If Ellesandra cared about Star, then genuine sorrow was a natural consequence. Nobody liked to see someone they cared about sad, and this connection only amplified that. Of course...Not everyone reacted the same way to sorrows. Perhaps, instead, that raw sadness would evoke...Protectiveness. Anger, at the ones who caused this sorrow. Or perhaps even courage, to stand up against the sorrow and be the devout rock that supported Star. Her power was not manipulative. It simply...Connected their hearts together. With happiness, it was often infectious. With the tranquility of her aura, it simply spread through the other. But there was much less tranquility to find in this moment. Her sadness, even with the guards held, was...Intense. A sorrow that ripped her apart inside, enough to overcome her and leave her shaking. Yet, Ellesandra could feel the way that the hug gave Star comfort. Without a word, it was communicated how the knight's embrace was like a dam against the tsunami. Star managed to wrangle her emotion enough to keep her sobs minimal, and it would be something that Ellesandra would be able to glean insight into as she did so. To be able to see that Star felt far, far greater sadness than she showed on the surface, if Ellesandra allowed themselves to look, even briefly, into her heart. It stood to reason that an empath was in great control of their own emotions, and yet the sadness was potent enough to cut her to her core; she certainly would and did cry over lesser things, but this sadness was, in many ways, similar to what Ellesandra faced. A feeling that overpowered her. That coursed through her very soul. A shackle that held her. Paralyzed her. As Ellesandra held the weight of a fallen princess upon their shoulders, Star was burdened by the weight of the unknown fate of her own mother. Yet, she did not feel an ounce of anger, or regret, or any negative feeling towards Ellesandra. She did willingly share her story, the context of her adventure. Where the knight felt they had overstepped, Star held a small, thin thread of...Relief? Yes, the pain was deep. But she was able to express it, and there in Ellesandra's arms, the edge grew duller. The icy cage around her heart melted, just a little. Each moment Ellesandra held her, her heat managed to beat just a little warmer under the grips of this terrible memory. Star dare not take more than she was given, but...There was a clear, obvious desire to remain close to the knight. And if the stalwart knight did hold her long enough, it would allow Star to again find her center and level her breathing as sorrow slowly...Slowly, but surely...Gave way to gratitude, and a deepened bond with the woman who held her.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took in a deep breath at the sorrow that she felt through the embrace as soon as it happened. Even through her emotional wall, she could feel how sad this memory and what happened made Star. It felt extremely odd, seeing this, and she wondered if that was how Star experienced Ellesandra's emotions when she looked at her. Ellesandra did feel that protectiveness come up, the desire to ensure that Star didn't feel this way again - to protect her from the feeling that she was trying so hard to protect herself from, too. Anger wasn't a big part of it, only a bit of anger at whoever did this but it was so background it likely wouldn't be noticed. Ellesandra slowly let her arms fully encircle Star and just held her, eventually reaching up and running a hand through the back of Star's hair. The desire to protect this woman was almost overwhelming, wanting to just squeeze the sadness right out of her and make her happy and jumping into the meadow again. Of course, Ellesandra couldn't do that - and wouldn't try. If anyone looked their way she gave them icy glares to ensure they kept to themselves and didn't interrupt as Star let out her sorrow. She didn't say anything, no soothing words or reassurances that most people would provide in this situation. She just held Star, letting her cry it out. Her own sorrow twinged in response to how much she'd seen and felt in Star, and how holding Star reminded her of holding Marigold, but she pushed it down. Unlike Star's sorrow where she couldn't just squeeze it out of the woman, she COULD just push her own sorrow down. And that totally got rid of it, right?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The hold that Star gave to Ellesandra was tight. What Star showed outwardly was not representative of the depths of this sorrow, that much Ellesandra would certainly feel. It ran deeper than choked sobs, tears, and needing a hug. It was the sort of sorrow that led the typical person to nightmares, to dangerous thoughts, to all the dangers of deep, all-consuming sadness. Guilt, as well, was significant and present. It wouldn't be hard to figure out why - Star likely felt personally responsible for all of this, whether it was true or not. Nobody bothered the two of them. If anyone saw it, they steered clear. Such was the polite thing to do, after all. Despite the darkness Star felt within her, she remained an empath. A master over emotion. So it wasn't long before she managed to subdue her sobs, regulate her breathing, and find a calmer place. Her hair which Ellesandra brushed their fingers through was...Remarkably soft. Silken threads of snowy white, pure and untainted by dirt or oils that would make the threads heavy or rough. "...Thank you," Star whispered from her place still holding Ellesandra, head against their shoulder. "I know you aren't the biggest fan of touching, because of what happens when we do. But it feels...Nice...To be held by you. I feel safe with you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra almost jumped when Star finally spoke. It had been obvious she'd been slowly bringing herself back together, but the whispering had surprised her. She squeezed tighter for a moment as Star spoke, and she had been just about to release Star, hold slackening and her body moving to let go, when she heard Star said that she felt safe with her. There was a pause where it felt like her own heart had sunk into her chest, words that had no ill intention whatsoever but obviously had a pretty severe impact on Ellesandra. She squeezed once more then stepped away, releasing Star and looking away from her. Her own eyes were misty now, and it had nothing to do with the sorrow she'd felt in her companion. Her jaw clenched and she reached for the handkerchief again, handing it over to Star for her now splotchy nose and eyes. She pressed it into Star's hand, if Star tried to refuse it. "Why don't we sit? Take some time to recover before you go back to Morrun's. He'll get the wrong idea if you come back looking like you're heartbroken." Star had been right. She hadn't liked the touching, and especially not when Star had said the last words she'd heard from Marigold. It took a lot of willpower to close up that wound again, looking away from Star who, while looking nothing like Marigold, reminded Ellesandra so much of her. Ellesandra couldn't continue to hold Star and risk her being able to get a better look into that emotion. She had mentioned before that for particularly powerful ones, she could sometimes see the memories associated with it - and THAT was not something Ellesandra was ready to share, verbally or otherwise. There was real fear on display in Ellesandra right now, fear that Star would be able to see straight through everything she was trying to pretend didn't happen. Everything that she refused to accept, in one way or another. Through that mountain that didn't exist. Without a word, Ellesandra made her way over to one of the benches alongside the meadow, sitting on the very far edge of it to give Star plenty of room without touching.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star did initially try to refuse the handkerchief. It being pressed firmly into her hand did force her to take it, though...She still didn't use it. She let her tears fall. They had slowed. But the odd sniffle and tear did still pass. She nodded lightly to Ellesandra, confused why the woman was so pained. Was it something she said? It must have been, but...She promised she wouldn't pry, and she would hold to that. The most she could do would assure Ellesandra she was present, that she was here for them, but she sincerely doubted Ellesandra had any major change of heart on the matter in the handful of minutes since Star had asserted that she wanted to know, but wouldn't press. So she moved to the bench, sitting next to but not touching Ellesandra. The bench looked over a clear pond of fresh water. Likely one of the main water sources for the grove. Star continued to not use the handkerchief. She instead just looked at it, brushing her thumb over the soft fabric. Obviously, the object didn't have any emotions for her to read, but her curiosity about it was clear. Despite that, she didn't ask about it or say a word about the clear mist she observed in the eyes of her companion, nor the strong emotions she observed in general. She was there if they wanted to talk but...She assumed they didn't. So she just spoke up about something else, as a way of reaffirming her promise to not force Ellesandra to speak about these things. "...Have you always trained with a rapier? Most knights I have met use longswords and shields. Not one to go with the popular choice, huh?" she put on a forced smile. She didn't even look at Ellesandra. Just kept looking at the embroidered cloth in her hands. The topic was random, of course. Just the first thing she could think to speak about that wasn't emotional. Something that let Ellesandra save face.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced over at Star, who appeared to just be examining the handkerchief. There was confusion as to why she wasn't using it; a frown crossing her face and looking up at Star's own face, before she shrugged it off and turned to look out over the lake. The question wasn't personal, at least on the surface. It was one Ellesandra thought she could answer, and still walk around the point that she didn't want to talk about. Her gaze ran along the water, silent for a few moments while planning out her response, not just speaking her mind immediately. Focusing on this task helped distract her, so even if Star hadn't intended it as a way to help, it was. "I did use spear and shield, for most of the time growing up. Eventually I dropped the shield as I became more talented with my magic; I needed a hand free to weave spells, but would keep the shield on my back for use between situations where I'd need it. I trained one of my charges with the rapier, though. She wanted to learn something that she could carry with her without it making her look...manly, she called it. Or improper. We talked about daggers that she could hide, but she wanted a weapon she could actually engage in sparring with, so we settled on a rapier." Ellesandra looked up at the clear sky, remembering that day with a wistful, sad smile. "I'm ambidextrous and she was left handed, so I taught her with my left hand so it was fairer for her to learn, easier for her to watch and emulate than if I used my right hand. In a later fight, I got wounded in my right arm pretty badly, and wasn't close to a healer to have them help repair it. Not to mention my particular, unique abilities make healing and restoration spells not as effective on me; a double edged sword, being particularly resistant to magic." The wistful smile had dropped from her face and she looked down to the lake, sighing. "I can use my right arm fine, but if I were to try to use it in a real fight, against anyone who had any strength or skill, it would be a liability. It doesn't do well with anything strenuous or heavy. So I picked up the rapier for myself in my left hand and use my right hand for my spells."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Had Star intended for it to be therapeutic? No real tell gave it away in her demeanour, but given how in tune she was with emotion, it would hardly be surprising if it was the truth. Being able to know just what to say to people seemed to be a somewhat consistent talent of hers, from what evidence had been shown in their time together thus far. She wore a more genuine smile as the explanation passed. "Resistant to magic? Must just be the arcane sort. I've felt no resistance to mine, though...Mine is rather unique, so I can't say it's too surprising. We'll have to see how well I can heal those wounds on your legs. It'll be important to know how effective my healing will be on you." She spoke forward, looking out at the water for a time, then back at the handkerchief. She smiled after a few moments of silence, presumably from something running around in her own mind. "I can only imagine the sight of you training someone. Or even a class of people. You have a...Presence about you. A conviction in your words that I think makes it easy for people to trust that you're being sincere." She seemed to be mostly thinking aloud with these words, as a question then followed: "Did you want to be a knight? You don't have to answer if it's too personal of course. I'm just...Curious about what small Ellesandra was like, and what eventually had you turning to a life of wandering. I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that somewhere in that life story are things that we aren't gonna talk about so...If it helps, leave whatever blanks are necessary. Unless you'd rather just not answer."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged at the resistant comment. The only spell, per say, that Star had cast that effected her was one that she hadn't needed anyways, and her absorption of it had been similar to the intended effect as it was. Star's more passive abilities, to see her emotions and share them via touch, weren't entirely the same. At least, that's why Ellesandra assumed they weren't the same thing; she certainly wasn't a magical scholar. The thought of her training a class of people made her shake her head, though. "A class of students would drive me crazy." Ellesandra liked structure, and too many students didn't. She wouldn't last for a week as a teacher to more than just one or two where she could tolerate and be patient with the sudden changes. "As for being a knight, it depends on the timeframe. I -" There was a pause, a mixture of relief, gratitude, and that grief rising back up to the surface again. "I was an orphan, so being a knight wasn't something I ever really considered, for a long time. When I was taken in, I wanted to help the family that did so. Being a knight just...lined up with how I could do that, and what I was good at." She shrugged, not moving on to how she turned to a life of wandering. That bit alone had already gotten closer to the mountain than Ellesandra was truly comfortable with, as evident by her left hand turning into a fist on her own thigh and her eyes turning away from Star. She didn't know why she fought so hard to prevent Star from seeing her tear up; Star could SEE the emotion, but it didn't matter. And like always, Ellesandra didn't let the grief or sorrow overwhelm and take hold of her. It was pushed back down. "Do what you're good at, right? That's how you make a life in the world. Find something you're good at and don't hate, and get people to pay you to do it."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
It was natural for Star to look at others, even if not just for the politeness of giving someone one's attention while they spoke. She didn't stare at them, didn't study them like she often did, however. She was trying to give Ellesandra a little space in that regard, though that she could see the strong force of guilt and sorrow that welled in them. She was tempted to reach out and comfort them by placing a hand on their shoulder, but...She had perceived in them that they didn't like her touch quite so much, given the effects that carried with it. It hurt. It hurt to know that something she relied on, something she wanted to do, to offer physical comfort, was unwanted. But she kept that hurt down, and managed to mask it in a way that wasn't typical for her. Ellesandra didn't have the same advantage as her, of course. It wasn't that she couldn't understand the hesitation. The desire to retain privacy. And it didn't matter that Star had the absolute best, brightest, most pure intentions. If Ellesandra didn't want to accept her desire to be closer, she had no choice but to respect that. And she would, even if she struggled to see someone in pain and not do anything about it. The thought of it, let alone actually doing it, tore her heart to shreds. So it was, her genuine smile that she had been wearing faded as she nodded to Ellesandra's words. A little more forced. A little more of a mask. For someone as expressive as Star, it wasn't hard to tell the difference. Others might not be able to see her emotions clearly, but she certainly didn't make it terribly challenging to read her like a book most of the time. She was trying to put on a smile for the knight, even if her heart felt like it was in a vice. "You're certainly good at helping people," she said, her voice a bit quieter now. She'd stopped crying and sniffling. Now it was just a...Looming cloud over her. A sorrow that clung to her and had not yet healed. "I'm sorry you had such suffering in your early years. I do hope you were brought in early in life...And that those who did take you in were loving and kind to you." Words, sincere as could be, spoken from a woman who, at some unknown young age, had been forced to fend for herself, based on the story she told.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged, latching onto the comment about suffering in early years. Thinking about that was easier than thinking about why she became a wandering knight, about everything surrounding it. "Nothing to be sorry for. I don't remember any of it. I think I was found when I was three? Four? They don't quite know how old I was, exactly, but too young to remember much from before that. As such, the day they found me was assigned as the anniversary of my birth, for future celebrations and such." A brief smile creased her face, thinking about a few of those, before she shook her head. "And they were more than kind to me." Up until the end, but Ellesandra didn't say that part. Taking a deep breath, she shook her head. "Why is it that you can pull emotions out of me that I haven't let myself experience in three years?" Three years, since it happened. She eyed Star a little suspiciously, as if somehow her magic was at fault for allowing her to just reach in and pluck them out. Straight past all of her guards and barriers. It was unfair, and that was just one of the reasons she wasn't comfortable with Star touching her. Considering that Star had no intention of using the handkerchief, as made obvious by her still just holding it, Ellesandra reached over for it again. She had no intention of offering it once more, with Star's refusal to put it to use. "I think we've been emotional enough for the day. What's next on the agenda, Miss-...Star?" This was Ellesandra trying her best to be polite in saying she wanted, no, needed the topic to change if they were going to talk. And move onto something lighter, something not herself preferably.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star smiled, genuinely again, hearing that those who took Ellesandra in were kind to her. Good parents. Yes. That was good. That was comforting, though some strange emotion flashed in Ellesandra with those words that Star couldn't place. Still...She didn't pry. She offered the handkerchief back when the knight reached for it. She smiled again at the perhaps rhetorical question. "...Emotion is what has defined my life. The connections that we form, one person to another. The best and worst things that come with being human. It's...Far easier to explore emotion, and far easier to speak about things you might not otherwise do, when you know the person you are with sincerely cares about it all." She looked at Ellesandra and flashed another smile, then looked back out at the water. "The longer you stay around me, the more I'm sure you'll get used to seeing me be emotional. I...Admit I can get worked up over small things at times. I'm still not perfect at controlling my own emotions, after all," she said with a quiet giggle. "I don't have anything in mind, Ellesandra. We're resting on your insistence, after all. So I'm content to just...Enjoy the sights. Be with you, and be calm for now. I admit I've been thinking about the state of affairs in Cloverport. Wondering if there was maybe some way that we could have returned peace to that place. But before you go chiding me...I know there are things even I can't hope to achieve on my own. And after the stunt we pulled I don't see any diplomatic options for getting rid of the pirates. I can only hope that that works itself out, somehow, I suppose."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't know how to respond to the idea of Star sincerely caring about her, and how she was feeling. It made her a little uncomfortable in that she wasn't sure she wanted someone to get close like that, to actually care for her and poke at things she'd rather leave buried. It seemed Star had agreed not to poke, though, so that was good. "Worked up over small things, like blueberries?" There was a wry tone of amusement in Ellesandra's words and emotions, remembering how Star had teared up and cried a little when Ellesandra had shared her blueberries with her. There wasn't judgment, though. It had been confusion and concern, and now amusement, at how easily Star had teared up over the blueberries. There was no judgment or demeaning attitude towards the fact that Star had shown emotions that easily, though. She spread open the handkerchief in front of her, fingers tracing the embroidered letters, M.K. "I'm not sure what we could have done for the citizens of Cloverport. Honestly, we likely made things worse. That, or they will think we will bring reinforcements and they'll leave. We can hope for that option, but the more likely thing is that they find the dead pirates, both that escorted their supposed elven captive as well as the ones out on the road that attacked you, and they'll take it out on the citizens." She flipped the handkerchief over, idly playing with the thread on it, before lightly folding it up into a neat little triangle. "We could go back and try to do something stealthily, but our options there are limited. Cutting off the head of their group would only bring another captain in their place, and maybe lash out at the village. Burn a ship, that makes it even less likely they leave and they might burn the town. People like that tend to give as good as they get. If you want to help them, then I'd suggest we just share the news of what happened and request the aid of those with enough soldiers to stamp them out in one blow. That way, we don't even have to stop our journey, either." The handkerchief was placed back in her pocket. Out of sight, out of mind; but always carried.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star blushed, but smiled at the mention of blueberries. She giggled. "...Nobody ever really paid much attention to that. And I...What can I say? I appreciate small gestures. You can tell a lot about someone by little thoughtful acts like that," she said, smiling back at the knight while idly kicking her legs. She then listened to the knight speak about the other options, and she paused for a moment, then looked around them. She was getting an idea. Perhaps a dangerous prospect, given her track record. "...I think you're right," she said, looking back at Ellesandra. "I think the elves here will want to know what those pirates did to one of their own. And I think it might be prudent to suggest that they oust those pirates by force, and establish better ties with the governing force in Cloverport. The two settlements are close enough, and the other city being a port means there'd be a lot of opportunity for trade," she said, smiling. "We should see if we can find someone of some authority. Perhaps Morrun would know where to direct us?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star with an eyebrow raised. "You...are a meddler, aren't you?" Like her previous comment about the blueberries, there was no judgment or indication that this was a negative thing. Instead, she was just amused by it, though she did note that this would likely mean a harder job for her in the future, what with making sure Star was safe and all. Sighing, she moved to stand, nodding to what Star was saying. "Then yes, Morrun did offer to introduce us to the leader already didn't he? We can set up a meeting if possible and go from there." She took a moment, stretching her arms up, and then leaning her torso back with her hands on the back of her hips. Stretches in each direction before she cracked her neck and turned back to Star. Her emotions from earlier had all been put back in their spot, feeling much more like herself - well, her current self. She did eye Star's still blotchy face from the sobbing, but didn't comment on it. If Morrun had something to say about it, she would follow Star's lead on it. Star didn't seem the type to hide why she'd cried, but Ellesandra wouldn't volunteer that information if Star didn't first.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star wore a proud, cheery, playful smile upon being called a meddler. A badge of honour, it seemed, rather than something to be ashamed about. "Only where there is evil to be meddled with," she said with a more selfsame chipper, singsong-y cadence to her voice. She rubbed at her eyes, but didn't seem to be too worried about anyone commenting on it. Or if she was, she didn't show it. Off they went, back to Morrun's place. It was growing a bit later in the day. Sunset would be upon them in an hour or two. When they arrived, Lissana showed a bit of concern upon seeing Star. "Oh, Star, Ellesandra. Is everything all right?" asked the elven woman. Star nodded. "Of course, all is well. Just an emotional chat brought on by discussing our next steps," replied Star. Honest, as ever. That seemed to be enough to satisfy the question. Morrun was at the dining table, halfway through eating a muffin. He swallowed and nodded to the two entering. Star began by holding out a hand. The coin pouch that Ellesandra had given her, the one they definitely took their pay out of, appeared in her hand with a subtle glow of light that rose from her palm. As she had said, it was her intent to return it to Morrun, unless Ellesandra stopped her.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along, walking just a pace behind Star and to the side, like most bodyguards would. A single diagonal step needed to cover Star, but giving enough personal distance that Star wouldn't feel crowded - or Ellesandra crowded by Star - and give the illusion to Star, if she wished for it, to forget that Ellesandra was there. When they arrived back to Morrun's place, Lissana's concern wasn't unsurprising. Ellesandra looked much better than Star of course, since she'd only teared up and hadn't let herself actually let go and cry. As they entered and Star went straight to returning the money to Morrun, Ellesandra just gave Morrun a sheepish smile. "Should have waited until we left to give it to her, hmm?" She commented, a minor scold to herself but not actually upset at the turn of events. She'd expected it as soon as Star had mentioned it, though there was a curious gaze given to Star's sleeve. Was there some sort of magical storage in there somewhere? She hadn't seen or felt the bag of coins the entire time they were at the meadows. Still, Ellesandra made no move to stop the return of the coin which she had definitely taken her pay out of. Crossing her arms, she moved to stand by the door to the kitchen, taking up a standard guards spot. This may be Morrun's house and there not be anything to guard against, but it was a comfort thing. She was used to finding a spot where she could see the exits and be close to her charge; not doing so was a sign of Ellesandra truly relaxing, and a level of trust that not even Star had fully earned yet.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun gave Ellesandra a chiding look. A look that said wordlessly that she went and screwed it up, all done with a smile on his lips. "We took our pay out of it, so you can keep the rest," said Star as she set the coins down for the elven man. The heavy thud the bag made had him instinctively knitting his brow. He went to inspect the bag, estimating the coins. He didn't seem pleased. "...What, did each of you take like, two coins?" sighed Morrun. "Honestly. I can't accept this," he said, looking at Star and Ellesandra. "You two barely took anything, as much is obvious," he continued, which now invited Lissana to share in the disapproving stares, threatening as a squirrel with her frown and cute pink apron. Star paused. "...Well, I took five coins. Fifty gold can be made to last a long while. So..." She then turned, slowly, to look at Ellesandra. "...How many did you take, then, Ellesandra?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh, Ellesandra had just fallen into a trap, hadn't she? The slow turn and look from Star made Ellesandra grit her teeth, narrowing her eyes at the mage. Had she planned this? She'd said she could tell when people lied - even implied that she knew Ellesandra hadn't really taken her pay out of the bag earlier. But to set her up for that right in front of Morrun and Lissana was just - well, devious. Ellesandra crossed her arms and held a stoic, nonplussed look on her face as she met Star's gaze. "I paid for my room at the Inn last night, and took ten platinum. And then I decided I would donate ten platinum back to our group fund for our journey, since we'll be sharing time together on the road and supplies and such, anyways." It was a total lie, and ended up to her only taking enough to pay for her room anyways. The thing is, Ellesandra knew Star could tell. And she was meeting Star's gaze in a challenge, the amusement at the situation rising. She wondered how far fetched she could get with her explanations before Star would call her on it in front of people; would she do so now, or would she let it slide? There was a little bit of humor showing, and an interest to see how much she could push Star before she was just straight up called on her bullshit.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Oh, that's a wonderful explanation, if I was a five year old that didn't understand how math works," said Star back with a similar amusement on her voice and posture. "Well in that case, I should explain that I took all of the money, but then donated it to you so you could donate it back to me so I could donate it back to Morrun. If you follow that logic, I think that means both of us got paid twice. Really, Morrun, you have no business being so generous to both of us," she said, briefly turning to the elven man for effect. No, it seemed Star had zero qualms in calling out the lie right then and there. She sighed. She could recognize that she hadn't taken all the money herself either. "Honestly. When we were first walking to Cloverport you talked about me hiring you. If I knew hiring your services cost a grand total of what...One gold per day, I could have hired you for a few months on that salary without issue. But I think we can all agree a knight's escort is worth at least a little more than that, can't we?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star took the excuse further and it got an honest, surprised laugh out of Ellesandra. She tilted her head back out belted out an amused chuckle, one she hadn't really made in so long she herself was surprised that it had come out. She cleared her throat, taking on the stoic look again, but this time looking to Morrun. "Did you hear that? You're quite generous, paying us twice." And then she looked back to Star. She tightened her arms around her own chest in her crossed arms position, shaking her head at her. "I'm sorry, you seem to be under the impression that the client gets to decide what the cost of my services is. No, my services are valued by myself. And I will sell my services for what I think is appropriate, which may change from one job to another." Her eyebrows raised, challenging Star to disagree. "Or do you not think that I am fully capable of recognizing the worth of my work? And what is appropriate to charge? I have been doing this job for three years, after all, and even longer beforehand in a longterm contract. I like to think I know what I'm worth." She knew she was lowkey arguing that her worth was less than Star was implying, but she also knew that it was up to her to charge what she wanted, not up to Star to decide what she should be paid. And she'd draw that boundary clearly. "If you can't afford me, well. Then I guess that's your loss." She said, feeling amusement at the mock bickering they had right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun and Lissana exchanged glances. The more these two observed Star and Ellesandra, the less they understood them. Not sleeping in the same bed, not even the same house, but... "They argue just like we do, dear," said Morrun to his wife, evoking a giggle. Star seemed to miss this comment as she fired back at Ellesandra. "Yeah? Well it might just be the clearest evidence I have no business being a pirate, because I sure do know when I'm stealing something!" she said, hands on her hips and a smile on her face as she leaned slightly towards the knight. "So be honest then, gallant knight! Let's negotiate a price, right here, right now! I anticipate the journey I'm undertaking will take upwards of a year. So I'm sure within that time frame I will have secured enough gold to purchase your services for a year thereafter at an agreed-upon price. So this is my formal proposition to hire you for a full year. Go on, name your price!" As she said this, she swiped the bag of platinum from the table again, ready to use this as a chance to back Ellesandra into a corner on the bargaining table. There was quite a lot of gold in the coinage of platinum for her to work with, and how she was planning to out-fox the knight wasn't quite clear, but it was their move.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced at Morrun curiously at his comment, not quite sure what he was implying there. Her and Star certainly weren't a couple, so it couldn't be that. Shrugging, she looked back at Star and her smile, as well as the challenge she was giving her. Ellesandra didn't name her price, not at first. At first, her eyes scanned Star up and down, trying to determine how serious she was about this. She didn't want Star to feel like she was making her out to be a thief, even though that would be wholly inaccurate and completely within Ellesandra's rights to offer her services for free. Leaning back against the wall, she raised an eyebrow at the woman, then looked to the bag. "Oh, I don't know. I'm thinking for a full year of my service, paid upfront, would be about....440 gold." That would be what was left in there, if Star really took 5 platinum and Ellesandra had taken 1 platinum to pay for her Inn room with. The exact amount, if Ellesandra's calculations were correct. "Considering you are getting the services of a trained Knight, that equals to just over 1 gold a day, doesn't it?" Math was not Ellesandra's specialty and she didn't even try to pretend to do the actual calculation for what it was worth. "If you would rather, you can pay half up front and keep the other half with you in case you need it on your journey. When you earn more you can pay it at the end of the journey." Okay, now Ellesandra was just being snobby, teasing Star into considering keeping the bag of coin herself.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star's reaction was instant. The moment Ellesandra said 440 gold, Star placed the entire bag into Ellesandra's hands, by first gently grabbing their wrist if necessary. There was still the nine gold in change Ellesandra had received that was also in the bag, but Star felt the dramatic act would be subdued if she fished around to grab those coins first. "There. Consider yourself hired, then," she said, arms folded. And through it all, Morrun was just chuckling to himself at the absurdity of this whole ordeal. The gold was right back where it started when he handed it to Ellesandra.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had expected something of that sort, taking the bag and bouncing it in her hand once, as if gauging how much was it in. She even put on the act of opening it and pilfering few some of the coins to better estimate and ensure that they were all platinum, like someone seeing a bag of coin for the first time. "Ah, lovely, perfect, thank you Miss Lumina." A grin was flashed towards Star. "Now, as someone who is invested in this journey we're on, I would like to donate to our group fund, so to speak. This can be used to purchase supplies, buy nights of lodging and pay for any travel costs during our year. Typically this would be entirely at the expense of the client, but again - I am particularly partial to completing this mission and wish to help." She then hefted the bag, weighing it again as if considering how much was in it and how much to give. "So...yes, I think this would do it." Stepping forward, she would take Star's wrist and turn it over, facing up. Her guards were up, expecting the touch, but it was only brief enough to place the bag of coins in Star's upturned palm. "Yes, I think that will do." If Star still resisted, she would just take the bag of coin and set it atop Star's head, before turning to Morrun. "So, we did come here for a purpose, Sir. I believe Star here wished to seek an audience with the leader of this settlement? Something about convincing him to help the town of Cloverport out, set up an allying agreement or something or another. I'm sure my client is better with words than I am, she is the meddler after all." Ellesandra was sporting a smirk the entire time she spoke.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was immediately ready to counter what she saw coming. Back to this talk of donating, as soon as it came, had Star pouting and putting her hands behind her back, folded over the small of her back and out of reach. The grin she wore said she felt she outfoxed her knightly opponent. But then they just put it on her head. "Wh-- Hey!" she said, doing a good job of balancing the coins on her head. Ellesandra then moving on without giving her a chance to counter seemed to seal the matter. She grumbled, taking the coins off her head as she leered at Ellesandra. Morrun quirked a brow at the knight. "Oh, did you? Here I thought you just saw fit to regale my wife and I in impromptu theatre," he said with a cheeky grin on his face. Lissana had a sweet look on her face while leaning against the wall that connected the dining area and the kitchen. Star, still clearly pouty about being bested at her own game, took a more serious tone when talking to Morrun. "...Yes. The nearby city of Cloverport is overrun with pirates. I mean, obviously. You know that as well as I do. It was my thinking that passing on the news of what happened to you to those in charge of this settlement will be the best course of action. First, because if they have done this once, they are sure to do it again. And as beautiful as this place is, Ellesandra and I aren't long to stay. So a return here after I have achieved my goal to see you both again aside, we won't be here to save any other innocent people here who might be targeted. As necessary as it was to do what we did, it's likely that whether we paid or attacked, the pirates would have felt either emboldened to get away with it again, or in this case, out for revenge. And the people here should not need to feel like they are being hunted. So, much as I detest violence...It's my suggestion that your settlement's hunters take action. Perhaps in a joint effort with the local militia of Cloverport. If the pirate influence is removed, then there will be safe passage, trade, and all the benefits of local cooperation." Star smiled. Morrun considered the words. "Well. You certainly make a diplomatic case for it, Star. But the decision's not up to me on that. I'd also rather not force Lissana to relive any of it, so I'd best speak on her behalf." He paused to smile at his wife, assuring them that he would handle things. Lissana had a small nervousness, a tremor in her figure that spoke of the trauma she would eventually have to deal with. Star clearly noticed, for she was giving Lissana that familiar stare, and it brought sorrow to Star's face. Morrun stood, moving over to the other two after giving his wife a kiss. "I'll see about getting you an audience."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She felt a pride and satisfaction fill her when Star pouted and seemed to relent about the coin. Oh, it was entirely possible that Star snuck the coin back somehow later, or just used it to purchase something for Ellesandra or something like that, but really what could she do about that? No, the gold had been given to Star, and it was hers to do with now. The theatre comment caused more amusement as she glanced at Lissana, then back to Morrun as he spoke with Star. Her mood quickly shifted to one of concern when Lissana was brought back up, and the trauma that happened to her. Ellesandra only glanced at her once before looking back to Morrun, not wanting her to feel like she was being stared or watched, or pitied by everyone in the room. At Morrun's confirmation about getting them an audience, she once more spoke up while looking to Star. "Well, while you do that, I believe by how dark it is beginning to get it should be time for some dinner. Lissana, would you like any help in the kitchen?" Ellesandra was not a great cook by any means, but she knew how to do the basic things at least. You didn't live alone travelling along the road without learning how to do camp cooking, and it could only be easier when doing it in an actual kitchen, right? Not to mention, the entire point of the offer was to get Lissana's mind off of the trauma she'd just been reminded of and give her the option of company, if she'd like it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star and Morrun looked at each briefly. Star smiled. "I'm famished," she said aloud in encouragement to Ellesandra. But there was something subtle to it. It was intentional. Star wasn't one to impose on others, so for her to make such a comment could only be to reinforce a sense of purpose in Lissana, who brightened at the thought of Ellesandra helping, and having something to focus on. "O-Oh, uhm, if you don't mind, Miss Ellesandra," she said, her more meek side appearing as the emotions took hold of her. Lissana had a bright side to her, but she seemed quite susceptible to the fear and discomfort of the memories. She still had fading red marks on her wrists and lips, as well as ankles, which weren't visible before given the woman was wearing long pants, but with her airy summer dress they certainly were. Manacles on wrists and ankles left their marks. "We'll leave dinner to you both then. Be back soon, my love," said Morrun, then existed with Star. Curiously, the coin bag was gone again, nowhere on Star's person. Where had it gone this time? She didn't have sleeves on her dress to slide it up, nor pockets to hide it in. But this wouldn't be something one could focus on long, for the two were out the door soon after.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There had been a brief pang of regret when she'd realized Star was going off to the meeting. Ellesandra had thought Morrun was off to set up a meeting, not that the meeting was happening now. Not that Ellesandra cared at all about the meeting itself, but just a matter of not being there in case the leader responded poorly for some reason. She glanced back, watching Star exit and silently hoping she hadn't just put Star in danger by trying to get Lissana's mind off of things. She didn't dwell on it for long, though, before turning to follow Lissana into the kitchen, not having even noticed the disappearance of the coin bag. "No Miss necessary, just Ellesandra is fine." She said, responding to Lissana a bit belatedly. She was being gentle, and would stand to the side, waiting for Lissana to guide her. This wasn't her kitchen, nor did she know what they were going to be making, so she stood at the ready. "What can I help with? I certainly don't want to get in your way with my help, so feel free to tell me where to go and what to do." Someone who had been chained up being able to tell others what to do, not just be told what to do, would be helpful right? Ellesandra wasn't sure how to approach this, but she was going off of gut feeling right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana gave a sheepish nod. She didn't wish to address a knight improperly, less so one that was dually responsible for saving her life. Lissana didn't know what Ellesandra was familiar with doing in the kitchen, but she did assume the others would be out for an hour or more. The notion that they were hungry had Lissana eager to make a bigger meal, so she invited Ellesandra down into the basement of the home. Therein, a cold storage room was set up with small blue mana crystals that kept the room icy cold. Frozen meats kept in storage was something of a higher class amenity, but if nothing else it did suggest that the two of them were capable of parting with five hundred gold somewhat painlessly. It was a lot, but they clearly weren't lacking. They were comfortable. A whole chicken was going to be used as part of it, which Lissana had Ellesandra carry while she grabbed some vegetables, spices, and herbs from her pantry. A couple more things were added to the knight's hold, though Lissana would have to grab it; she shelving was built with elves in mind. And elves were regularly well above six feet tall, so the knight would find much of the higher shelves out of reach without some assistance. All said and done, the two moved back up and Lissana got to focusing on dolling out the tasks. If Ellesandra was familiar with how to butcher a chicken, that would be their job once the plucked chicken carcass had been out long enough to thaw, which curiously only took about ten minutes. Curious magic at work, but quite the convenience. Most of the work was done on a cutting board with the veggies, which were being used both to add substance to the meal as well as to cook with the chicken to impart their flavours. The chicken needed to be sectioned into quarters, and Lissana described the ultimate goal as an aromatic dish that used spice and earthy vegetables on top of an herby rub on the chicken to give it all a wonderful flavour. Potatoes would round out the plate of chicken and veg, with a wholesome chicken-shallot gravy for the whole or part of the meal. An anecdote was thrown in: apparently Morrun liked gravy on everything, jokingly explained as the man bathing his food in it. He had seemed a bit generous with the syrup at breakfast, so it was not a major surprise. But of course, the way Lissana spoke of her husband would come as no surprise in how loving it was. How after however long they were married, she still was as in love with him now as the day they met. But with the focus on the task, Lissana wouldn't stray too far from small talk unless Ellesandra had specific questions.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a good worker. She followed along with Lissana and helped her carry things, doing what she asked. A strange glance was given to the small blue mana crystals, but she didn't comment on them. Her eyes stared up at the tall cabinets far above her head, and was glad that Lissana was getting things out of them instead of her. Once back up in the kitchen, she followed Lissana's instructions. The small talk was all she needed or offered, since unlike Star she had no idea how to help ease the tension that Lissana was probably feeling in regards to the recent trauma she'd had. Ellesandra had offered her company and something to do to distract the elf, and that was about all she knew to offer in a situation like this. The food sounded delicious, and smelled delicious as she was helping prepare it. She was happy to handle the chicken and prepare it, and then begin slicing and chopping vegetables and such, but she left most of the actual cooking to Lissana. Ellesandra knew just enough not to burn the house down and to be able to survive on her own; she wasn't about to step in on Lissana and mess anything up. As Lissana began talking more and more about Morrun, Ellesandra found that would probably be a relatively safe topic to delve into. Asking how they met, who proposed to who and how that went, and all those typical questions she'd learned the kitchen and serving staff would gossip about growing up. Ellesandra had never really partaken in said gossip and girlish questions, but it didn't mean she hadn't been around enough to listen in and hear the types of things that were asked. Beyond that, Ellesandra was quiet and let Lissana talk, or let a comfortable silence build between them.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The story that Lissana had to tell on the matter was a simple but cute one. Morrun was a planar scholar, Lissana a teacher of the Seldarine teachings. The inn bore the same name in part - 'Seldarine'. She went on to explain it was the elvish pantheon, though she didn't get into technical details. But it had sparked a connection, with the two meeting in a library and discussing a place known as the Feywild for so long that the library had to inform the two of them mid-conversation that they were closing for the day, and on that night the two walked among the stars and simply explored the connection they felt. It led to a swift romance borne of a shared scholarly interest, and of course helped by the fact that the two found one another so very beautiful. Morrun proposed to Lissana quite quickly by elvish standards - it was only twenty years later! Which, if that brought with it any confusion would lead to Lissana speaking to how Morrun was two-hundred and seven years old, and Lissana was one-hundred and eighty five. Still quite young, by elvish timelines. Lissana then took a break from cooking while there was less to do and jaunted up the stairs to come back down with an oil painting that had been made of them on their wedding day, showing Morrun in a stylish dark-green set of his finest clothes, with Lissana in a brilliant emerald-green dress. The painting was well done. Not a masterwork, but a competent painter certainly was wielding the brush. Of course, it would have taken more than a day to create such a thing, so the two likely dressed up more than a few times to get this done. A beautiful memento, all the same. She returned it to their bedroom once she had shown it off thoroughly, then returned to finish cooking. Between the story and the cooking, it did seem to have Lissana in higher spirits. A bandage for the pain for the day, even if it was still going to be a long road ahead for Lissana. Nightmares were sure to come, but that Lissana was saved allowed them to take on a semblance of normalcy that would certainly see them healing in time. They had safety and a loving husband. They would be okay. Time passed, and while the food cooked, Lissana saw fit to prepare a dessert as well. A pie, she settled on, but there was some indecision about what filling to use. She would take Ellesandra's input if they had any, but if not she would make an apple pie for no particular reason other than having a bit of a surplus of apples. Morrun and Star were taking a bit longer than one might expect, but surely they would return soon.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was patient in listening to the story, offering a smile in the right spots and nods and attentively listening to the elven woman. The painting surprised her, eyes raising in surprise at the idea of them having gotten that painted and how much effort that must have taken. They certainly were well off then, between the mana crystals and being able to afford such a painting. Eventually, Ellesandra had just stopped working, letting Lissana take over the activities and more just keeping her company in the kitchen, in order to prevent them from running out of things to do to keep Lissana busy. When the topic of pie was brought up and the option of what to use for it, Ellesandra recommended blueberries if they had any left from breakfast. She didn't elaborate on why, though Lissana had been at breakfast that morning and had clearly seen Star get teary eyed about the knight sharing her blueberries. She'd glanced out the window occasionally, as time passed getting a little worried that something might have gone wrong with this meeting. Surely if it had been a quick meeting they would have been back by now, right? Then again, it was entirely possible they just had to wait for a while to be able to even meet with the leader of the camp, if the person was busy with other things. Or even Star being her meddlesome self and actively helping plan. A soft smile crossed her lips in amusement at the thought of Star bent over a war table with a map of Cloverport on it, pointing out where the ships were and everything else she remembered about the pirates. Maybe not actively suggesting battle tactics - that didn't seem up Star's alley - but providing as much information as possible definitely did. Moving to lean back against the wall again, she'd look towards Lissana and change the topic so it didn't get stale. "So Seldarine is an Elven deity? Is there anything I should know about them? I apologize, I'm not particularly versed in deities beyond those I grew up with. The land I grew up with mostly served Tyr, though I was particular to Torm in my youth. Knighthood and all, tended to be dedicated to loyalty and honor." Less personal, hopefully, but also a topic most people found uplifting. Ellesandra may have long lost her faith in deities being righteous or good as they might proclaim to be, but she knew that religion was important to a lot of people in time of hardship.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Hm? Oh, it's not a single deity. It's in reference to one of the two elvish pantheons. Without bridging into the entire history, Seldarine is elvish for 'fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood'. The Seldarine follow Corellon and his consort, Angharradh, among the other lesser deities below. There's much you could learn, but as for what you should know, it is simply that long, long, long ago, Corellon and Lolth were once lovers, but Lolth, called Araushnee at the time, allied herself with Gruumsh to try and kill Corellon. Araushnee was exiled by Corellon, where she took the name Lolth, and with a whole lifetime's worth of reading in the history being skipped, it is now that the Seldarine and Lolth-sworn oppose one another. You will find no drow among our ranks, even if there are some among the drow who do good." She then giggled. "You'll have to forgive me as I acknowledge that you are...Quite exactly the sort of follower of Torm that I envision. Protective, lawful, duty-bound, righteous...I shall have to offer him my thanks in prayer, and perhaps see if there is a temple in his name near us for me to make a donation to. He might certainly have had a hand in bringing you to me in my hour of need; even if he had not, he has guided you to become the sort of person who would do as you had." A smile was given. Of course, Lissana didn't know the particulars of whose idea it was, only that Ellesandra had played a major role in her salvation. She explained all this while working on the filling for what was to be a blueberry pie. If she had any inclination what the recommendation was for, she didn't say anything. But it was after this lecture that revealed Lissana to be quite the religious sort that Star and Morrun returned, walking into the home with calm smiles about them. Though Star had a look about her as she met eyes with Ellesandra. A look of slight nervousness. A look that suggested she might have news that Ellesandra might not like.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't commented on how she was the exact type of follow of Torm that Lissana would expect. She just silently nodded, knowing that if she disagreed about Torm having anything to do with her rescue it might sound insulting to someone who was so obviously strongly religious. She was also saved from having to find any other topics to discuss by the return of Star and Morrun. Ellesandra quickly looked Star up and down to ensure nothing had happened to her while she was away, the concern that she'd had quickly turning to relief, then confusion and concern again when she met eyes with Star. Then dread and acceptance. She sighed, running a hand through her hair before pulling it up into a ponytail again, just so it would be out of the way when it came to whatever she had just been volunteered to do, or for dinner. "I take it we're joining the return trip to Cloverport? Or is that look for some other reason?" She eyed Star, taking a wild guess at what that nervousness might be for. Star was a meddler, and she'd thought that maybe Star had just been helping plan. But maybe Star had actively volunteered their assistance; it was the most likely option, Ellesandra thought. Of course it was also possible that Star had somehow insulted the elven leader and they were being kicked out, but that seemed more like something she would do, not Star. A glance was given over to the food cooked, and then a polite nod offered to Morrun, before looking back to Star to wait for the news that she was probably not going to like.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Oh, good. You already heard," said Star with a nervous smile that silently said 'don't kill me please'. "...Though technically it's only my own services that were required to convince the council. A compelling argument was made that I had no business requesting others risk their life if I was not willing to do the same; there was quite the disagreement between two of the council members, one stating that the elves were safe here and that the solution was for nobody to be leaving without escort, the other saying that it was cowardly to hide in this place waiting to be discovered...It grew a little heated for a moment," explained Star, though she kept a chipper tone. "All is well though. And as much as I can insist that you yourself aren't required to join along, Ellesandra, I know how futile that line of discussion is so...We move at dawn. For what it's worth though, I only am acting as a healer, behind any frontline we establish. The wounded will be brought back so I can help minimize injury or loss of life. I'm more of a liability in a full scale fight like this anyway. As you saw I can protect myself but...Not for a protracted fight." Morrun said nothing, just moved to his wife. Lissana looked initially concerned, but hearing that Star wouldn't be on the front did ease her worried looks a touch. "The plan is to make contact with the local lord. Then, in tandem with the local militia, the force ought to be so overwhelming as to force a retreat. And when the pirates run back to their ships to set sail, the coastal ballistae will sink them." A sound plan in theory...But it had yet to touch upon the matter of how the pirates got in in the first place, with such defenses at the ready. By chance, perhaps? Stealth? The jolly roger handn't been flown on any ships after all. But surely the port city had guardsman enough to fight back? There remained pieces that might not be known, and could either be nothing at all, or details that could turn a bloodless confrontation into choas in moments.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at the 'already heard' part. She hadn't, she had just guarded a meddler before. Star was way too similar to Marigold. It gave Ellesandra the exact exasperation she'd felt before, and that was both a pleasant thing to feel again as well as painful, remembering the last thing Marigold had meddled in and how that had turned out. She rubbed her face with her hand, exasperation and stress obvious even without Star's ability to see it, but what Star would be able to see - beneath everything - was an ounce of pride in her for not just backing down. "Fine, back lines is good. I'll accompany and guard to ensure that they don't flank you or send someone in as a spy but is actually injured or anything." Ellesandra's actual talents would be better on the front lines, but she was not leaving Star. And she was not bringing Star with her to the front lines, so rear guard it would be." A deep breath was taken, then she looked over to Lissana and Morrun. "Good thing we'll be filling up on food tonight. Should get plenty of rest before setting off tomorrow." Ellesandra hoped the attack and retaking of the city would be as easy as Star had just laid it out. She highly doubted it would, though. She didn't know how the pirates had taken the place over, but it was likely they had inside men. If the elves were contacting the local lord, it was very possible they could be walking into a trap. There wasn't exactly fear, in regards to this, but caution and concern for Star in this whole process. Damned pure hearted women not knowing when to refuse a risk. "Any other news that I should know in regards to your meeting tonight, or the new mission tomorrow?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star of course knew that Ellesandra didn't hear about the plans ahead of time. How could they? Only Star and Morrun knew; the rest of the hunters would convene through the night, go through their reverie, and be ready by dawn. Star and Ellesandra had the disadvantage of needing twice as much rest as everyone else in this settlement, so they would need to sleep sooner rather than later. Star nodded to the notion of Ellesandra staying on the backlines. There was a bit of relief in her own face. Not that she believed the pirates could best Ellesandra in battle, but she didn't want to invite the knight to injury either. She shook her head to the question of other news. "That's about it. We all agree the threat to the region is too great to ignore. I will simply need to meditate tonight before bed, so I will need time alone after, and after tending to your wounds." Of course Star wouldn't forget about that part. "My meditation will ensure I am in top shape for tomorrow, so you can rest easy tonight, Ellesandra. We'll meet here at dawn tomorrow, then join the rear guard at the gates." With all that squared away, if there was no other business, it became time to eat.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. "No need to heal me. I'll be fine, and I'd rather you be up to absolute full strength tomorrow if you're going to be healing those who are injured. My guess is you'll have a lot more work to be doing tomorrow than I will." If things went to plan, that was. Rear guard only saw action if things didn't go according to plan. Otherwise, she was probably going to be just a bell girl, running to and fro getting supplies and helping carry injured people in or something. She'd done that role before while in rear guard; it wasn't like she was just going to be standing around, but the difference between doing any small task Star would need of her versus actively healing injuries was pretty major. As it came time to food, Ellesandra would help Lissana bring it all out to the table, and then move to take the same seat she had before. A polite nod was given to Lissana in thanks for the food, overall, and she eyed the chicken with more interest than she had the pancakes and sausage this morning. She didn't just delve into it, though. She would wait and be polite, letting everyone else grab at their food first. She'd talked quite a bit with Lissana earlier, so unless she was directly spoken to she was quiet, letting her introversion recharge, but she was attentive to the conversation nonetheless, glancing back and forth during any small talk over dinner to follow who was talking and what they were saying. She seemed relatively at peace, still having some concern for Star but mostly just relaxed - probably some of the most relaxed Star had seen from Ellesandra yet.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"We'll be in combat tomorrow. I'm healing you tonight," said Star with a stern tone. That wasn't negotiable it seemed, and Star didn't seem keen on hearing otherwise. So unless Ellesandra was keen on squabbling some more in front of the married couple, dinner began and the relaxed atmosphere was pleasant. Star didn't seem interested much at all in the chicken. A small piece for her. Lissana took a leg, and Morrun a breast, leaving a good amount left for Ellesandra. Star seemed to prefer eating fruits and veggies. Not a strict vegetarian by any measure, but she clearly had her preference if these meals had been any indication. It also likely mattered whether there was a choice in the matter or not; living on the wilderness, small game and protein was a necessary food, so even if Star's diet had its preferences, necessity would always trump them in all likelihood. Small talk was all that amounted from the table. Lissana spoke of showing off the wedding portrait, and of course Star insisted on seeing it, so it was brought down again for Star to see after the meal. Plenty of food for all it seemed, leaving Ellesandra a solid half of the chicken to themselves. A good, filling meal; the elven herbs and spices gave the meal a subtle, earthy flavour that was wholesome and left one's gullet feeling pleasantly plump with a lingering, herby aftertaste that set them all up quite well for dessert. Lissana was no gourmet chef, but it was the sort of staple meal that would never get old on the palette. And as predicted, Morrun's plate was in some places more gravy than it was food. Hard to blame him, as the gravy added even more delight to an already pleasant dish. After some enjoyable small talk, Lissana and Morrun talking about how they met for Star, dessert came. Star gave a playful side-eye to her knightly companion, but it was with a warm smile. No tears this time, thankfully, but Star was clearly in heaven with the dessert. A fresh pie was a perfect finish to the evening. But before Ellesandra could walk away from it all, Star would be sure to get in their way and gesture into the guest room for a bit of privacy so she could heal them. Not that flashing a bit of thigh was all that risque, but better to not force the knight to stand in a position with Star on her knees in front of them for the married couple to joke about.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't fight the comment. She was afraid Star wouldn't understand how much energy it would take to heal her, but she also knew that it wasn't worth having an argument over right now. Instead she fully delved into the chicken. The only kind of meat she liked more than chicken had been salmon, though she had only had that once or twice, and could you really call fish, meat? Either way, she ate plenty, careful not to over eat so that she wouldn't be too tired tonight and thus in the morning, but more than enough to sate herself. Unlike Morrun, she used very little of the gravy, only enough to add a bit of a wetness to the meat and help swallow it down, letting the taste of the chicken itself be the main event on her plate. She also ignored the side eye she got from Star when it came to the dessert, and only ate a very small piece of it. This wasn't to save some for Star, and more that she normally wasn't one for super sweet foods. Savory and salty were her preferences, and pies tended not to be like that. So she ate enough to be polite, especially since she'd been the one to recommend blueberries, but that was about it. As the food was finished entirely and Star insisted again on healing her, she sighed and moved to stand up. "Yes, my lady." The teasing and mocking tone at how Star was ordering her was apparent. There was no malice behind it, just her poking fun at how Star had gone from being a polite companion who 'hired' Ellesandra to now ordering her to get healed. She would walk off towards the guest room, leaving the door open as she stepped in. Not wearing her armor or leggings, she had no real choice but to just drop her breeches down to her knees. She also didn't know what position would be best for Star to do this, so she lowered them to her knees and stood with her legs wide enough apart to prevent them from falling all the way down. Ellesandra wore basic white undergarments, absolutely nothing special and designed entirely for function, not for anything else. Her thighs looked relatively smooth, minus a stray hair here and there since she hadn't exactly been keeping up on keeping them smoothly shaven, and of course the bandages that were still wrapped around where the wound itself was on both thighs. It had fully scabbed over and was healing decently, though was obviously a bit red in irritation at her continued movements and how much weight she'd put on them the previous day while carrying Star.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a playful smile at Ellesandra at the mocking tone. Their little jabs back and forth were in good fun, and the mystic woman clearly understood and was happy to play along. It allowed a more casual closeness between them, rather than a stiff one between hired hand and patron. Even if that was technically the case, the way Star treated it was anything but; she would be just as insistent on this even if she hadn't hired Ellesandra, and had no intentions now or ever to use that agreement against the knight. Star did have a bit of a blush as the knight dropped their pants. Rather unavoidable, but with them standing like this to allow Star at their wounds, it was a rather...Awkward position as Star got down on her knees and moved her hands to the knight's thighs. Gentle hands removed the bandages and examined the wounds. She smiled, seeing they were healing nicely. But she wasn't about to leave them as they were. Her fingers moved onto the wounds themselves, pressing the pads of her four primary fingers vaguely equidistant from one another across the length of the cuts. Then, a gentle flow of something that was...Magical, yes, but it did not feel the same as any other times others had healed Ellesandra. First there was a small tingle of magic, something that touched against the resistance Ellesandra had like a wave upon a wall of rocks. Then...A flowing sensation through that resistance. Not pierced, but...Bypassed all the same, as if whatever Star was doing didn't fit the same mold of what Ellesandra's innate resilience was accustomed to. It looked effortless to Star, but then again so did her radiant, rainbow armor. And both of them saw how that went. But after this sensation came the soothing. The pain melted away. The irritation ebbed. The skin glowed under her touch, and the wounds vanished in a blink. The rash, the scabs, were no more. Star looked at the results, then smiled and rose to her feet again, keeping eyes above the waist to allow the knight to get their modesty back. "There. Wasn't so bad, was it?" she said, warmly smiling. "And look, I'm not doubled over heaving. I promise...I'll be more than ready for whatever tomorrow brings. I won't be acting alone, so the burden of healing will be spread among the group of healers." Star certainly seemed to be fine moving on like nothing happened, but...There was no ignoring that whatever she did, nothing about it should have played out as it had with the way Ellesandra's resistances were. It defied explanation. Was Star just...Special like that? Or was something else going on? The wounds were healed, that was certain. But...How? Did Star just expend a mountain of energy to do it? She certainly didn't seem fatigued...But maybe she was hiding it, and waiting for Ellesandra to leave before doubling over in exhaustion?

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She felt the awkwardness, and turned her gaze up so that she wasn't looking down at Star while she was doing her work at all. Her muscled thighs tensed and flexed at the feel of Star's hands on them, even just removing the bandages, and when she felt Star begin to use magic, Ellesandra had actively prepared herself to allow magic in. Naturally, magic seemed to roll off of her if it was directly targeted at her. Generic, area spells didn't exactly roll off of her, but tended to have less severe of an effect. Healing magic was a direct target, and between the magic usually rolling off and Ellesandra's body also wanting to naturally absorb the mana and energy within the spell, she had to actively focus on NOT doing that. She couldn't stop her natural resistance, but she could stop her body from trying to just suck in the mana. It was an important skill she'd learned when she'd first discovered her abilities, found after absorbing too much magic unintentionally and causing a severe mana sickness in herself. The healing didn't go as she expected. Oh, she still had to prevent herself from drawing in some of Star's mana and energy with the healing, but her natural resistance seemed to just...not exist. She looked down, over her shoulder at where the wounds were when Star stood up, frowning at how simple it had been. Star didn't LOOK fatigued or as if she had tried to just power through a strong barrier. The confusion was evident, even as Ellesandra reached down and pulled her breeches back up, re tightening them around her waist. Her eyes never left Star with a frown on her face, turning to her and crossing her arms. "Either you're hiding how much energy you just put into that or there is something you're not telling me, Star." Neither option was good, honestly. The former was bad for her role tomorrow, the latter was bad for her knowing what to expect. "I have never been healed as easily as that, not without a healer expending an enormous amount of energy to do so. I have scars all over my arms and torso for that reason. Why were you different just now?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a knowing look on Star's face. There was no doubt she knew that this was wrong somehow for the knight. But for a moment she collected her thoughts, considering how she might make this out such that Ellesandra didn't chide her. Or chide her...As much. Star folded her hands behind her back, looking somewhat like a kid with their hand caught in the cookie jar. "Well. I know regular healing spells, of course. But I felt the resistance on you, and that wouldn't have worked very well. Much as you might not believe me, I do think about how to properly expend my mana so that I can do all that I need to do, as well. I know I'll need my reserves for tomorrow. So brute forcing past your resistance wasn't a smart idea. So instead I used..." She paused, pursing her lips. "...Another method. Something unique to me. My mother called it 'sympathetic healing'. It'll probably be how I have to heal you each time I do. But look!" she said, throwing her arms up in the air with a smile. "I'm fine! No need to fuss!" Her reaction was a little...Forcibly chipper. Trying to keep Ellesandra from asking too many more questions, perhaps? After all, Star did swear not to lie to them, so it was likely if there was more to it, any further questioning would ensure Star spill the beans so as to not be lying by omission. Still. The hope was there that her given, surface explanation was enough. It probably wouldn't be. But she could hope.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was suspicious. Star seemed to be too chipper about healing her. Her lips pressed into a thin line and her eyes narrowed, watching Star for a moment. There was definitely something going on there, but Star was obviously avoiding talking about it. She looked her up and down once, checking to see any signs of fatigue as if she had, indeed, brute forced the healing. Seeing nothing, she grumbled. "Well, isn't that convenient?" She muttered to herself. Finding the one person who could apparently heal her without any injuries and being hired by her. Shaking her head, she turned to head for the door. "Get some rest then, Star. Whatever it is you did, I'm sure you need to recover from it." It sounded like an order, though Ellesandra wasn't exactly going to be around for it. She looked back over her shoulder at Star, eyeing her up and down again. The suspicion was there; she knew Star was hiding something, she just didn't know what it was. And like the night before, she was not going to be sleeping here with her but at the Inn. "Do you need anything before I go?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked a little surprised that Ellesandra left it at that. But it was fine. She smiled, and shook her head. "I'm quite all right. I'll be in meditation for a while, so please pass on my goodnights to Morrun and Lissana and ask them to keep the door closed, as I will need peace for it. It will ensure I am, as promised, in tip top shape for tomorrow. We'll see peace brought back to this region by sundown, Ellesandra." She smiled again. "Sleep well. I'll see you at dawn." And if that was that, she saw fit to set up on the bed and begin her meditation, trusting Ellesandra to close the door behind them before going to the inn. Presumably, Ellesandra had some coin of their own for the inn, as Star had been 'donated' back the large sum given by Morrun.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched Star for a moment longer. She let the pause extend even after Star reassured her, and wished her a good night. A moment for Star to open up about whatever magic that was. She flexed her thighs, feeling the fully healed skin and that it didn't hurt at all anymore. When nothing came, she just nodded. "Sleep well." The door was shut behind her and she headed off into the main room, smiling to Lissana and Morrun. "She'll be meditating and then heading to sleep to prep for tomorrow, so please don't disturb her unless necessary. Lissana, before I head back to the Inn to do the same myself, would you like any assistance with cleaning dinner up?" They had, after all, just went straight back to Star's room right after dinner. It was only in hindsight that Ellesandra had realized how potentially rude that had been, and was entirely prepared to help clean up or do whatever dish washing would be needed before going to the inn for another night's rest. When she returned bright and early in the morning, she'd be fully armored again and prepared for battle, warrior's ponytail and all.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The lingering moment on Star eroded her. That something was left unsaid, that Ellesandra knew it...Star could not allow it to go without being said. She had thought she wanted it, because it would keep Ellesandra from being upset. If Ellesandra had just left promptly, it would have happened differently. But Star could not accept feeling like she had lied to Ellesandra. So... "...I took your pain," she said just as Ellesandra turned. She then turned and lifted the skirt of her dress to show the location where the wounds had been on Ellesandra. There was no wound to be seen, but there was a slowly fading mark on her skin, a magical line that copied the shape of Ellesandra's wound. Admiring Star's shapely legs and smooth, feminine thighs would have to wait for another time that she wasn't exposing them for a purpose that would likely anger Ellesandra to some measure. "The wound does pass to me initially. But it heals. I am not damaged by this. My body does not suffer broken skin nor bloodloss. It is taken unto my aura instead." She looked at Ellesandra sternly, then. "I need you to hear me when I tell you I am not harmed by this act. I take on the agony of the wound...And it does take from my magical strength." She lowered her skirt again, turning to face Ellesandra once more. "But the mightiest strength of auramancy, of my magic, is known as purity of self. Disease, afflictions, wounds...So long as my aura remains strong, these melt off of me. I have no scars on my body, despite being wounded many times. Of course I can still suffer mortal blows, hence my ability to harden my aura to an impenetrable armor, as it is better to be exhausted than dead. So before you chide me...It is my purpose and desire to take the burdens of others. I know my limits. I will not use this power recklessly or foolishly. But had I been there to heal you when your arm was damaged, I would have saved you from the lingering injury, and would not have suffered it myself beyond however many hours or days of pain I would endure as my aura cleansed me of its influence." She sighed. "...I might still be able to undo what was done, with time. But for now, I simply...Needed to know that I could heal you, if it came to it. If it comes a time where it is martial prowess we require, and you have been critically wounded...Our best chance will be for me to endure the agony instead, and allow you to fight on. So before you think me foolishly taking a wound of yours that I know you're more than capable of enduring yourself...Understand that my mind thinks days, weeks, months ahead of now in this moment." Clearly, with all that she had to say on the matter, she was very much anticipating that Ellesandra would be none too pleased about this revelation of what Star would need to do to heal them. Not a mortal danger but...If Ellesandra was run through, left with a crippling wound...Star would be left suffering intensely for her efforts to heal them. But the utility of it was clear. Even if it meant Star passed out from the pain, she could surge Ellesandra back into the fight. And while against drunk pirates it was unlikely to be anywhere near necessary, there might come a time where it was needed. At least now, with Star keeping to her promise of honesty, Ellesandra had a chance to draw boundaries for it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had turned, preparing to walk out before pausing when Star spoke up. She stood, frozen for a moment at that first sentence. There was shock, as that had NOT been something she had been expecting at all. Then, the shock quickly morphed into anger. She turned around, eyes narrowed and glaring at Star with a fury that looked like it could burn the room down. She stepped back inside the room, closing the door behind her again, though from here - she didn't know what to do. She obviously wasn't going to stomp towards Star and intimidate her; that wasn't how she would ever deal with her anger. And this wasn't her room to break anything, which was also unhealthy way to deal with her anger. So she stood, jaw clenched and glaring at her as Star explained what happened, showed her, and then try to make excuses for it. All of these words, so much explanation, just for Ellesandra to feel the anger still there. The thing was, it wasn't anger that Star had caused pain on herself for healing her; though Ellesandra hated the idea of that, it was that Star hadn't seen fit to tell her she was testing this. She wouldn't have been happy with the idea, but Star made very good points in that it would be useful to know how it worked, in case it was ever needed on their journey. She hated the idea of it being needed, and as if she needed another reason not to let herself get injured, she resolved to ensure it wasn't. No, overall, she was upset at the ruse. It was the first breach of trust Star had done, and it coming from someone who seemed as pure hearted and honest as Star, that hurt. Well, Ellesandra's form of hurt was lashing out in anger, so it she didn't really feel the hurt itself, but it was there. And then another thought came to her mind. Could Star take the pain from her emotions, too? There was a fear that Star would try, somehow, to remove that 'nonexistant' mountain and take it upon herself. Would Star even be able to? Surely the woman was better at processing emotions than she was, but it had been three years building, being repressed, building more, and being further repressed. If or when it was ever fully released, it would probably crush whoever felt it. "You." The word came out thickly. She had to force it out in a way that could be understood. "Will never do that without explicit permission again. Ever. Do you understand, Miss Lumina?" Ellesandra would not lash out against Star physically, ever, but verbally? Returning back to title, rather than first name, was the minimal indication of how this conversation was part of their business arrangement; not of their budding friendship.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A nuance to Star's powers was proven in this moment. Ellesandra didn't need to say a word for their feelings to come across. It was instant, and Star recoiled upon seeing the anger. Rather immediately, tears formed in her eyes. Regret. Sadness. Pain. It was writ across her face as the tears flowed down her cheeks; she repressed the sobs that wished to join it, but she couldn't hide the tumultuous emotion that raged in her. "The times it has its uses are times where acquiring explicit permission may not be a luxury," came her response. She was upset, obviously. Wishing she had handled it another way, perhaps. But there was a fire in her eyes that matched Ellesandra's own. "Saving your life may require a decision that moves my body before I consciously make a decision," she continued, her figure trembling, but standing with the conviction with which she risked her life in Cloverport. "And even though you've sought to fight me at every turn to be of use to you, to help you, I won't let anyone stand in the way of keeping you safe. Not even you." She couldn't know the specific reasons for Ellesandra's anger, but a general sense was enough for the immediate moment. She was obviously scared. Not of Ellesandra hurting her. But that she might have hurt Ellesandra. Her words were soft-spoken, spoken through tears. She wasn't wishing to make an argument out of it, or disturb the elven couple. But there was an...Intense concern in her. A flame that burned behind her eyes directly straight at Ellesandra. "That's all this was. When my regular healing failed, that's all I had left. And whether you want to try and hurt me by using my last name to make distance from me or not won't stop me from caring, either. You saved me, and have shown me how much deep kindness you have inside you. That cannot be undone. I will do whatever it takes to ensure we both get to walk away from whatever tries to impede us in our travels. I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me. So just...S-Stop trying to keep me from doing my part!"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The tears should have assuaged some of her anger. They should have warned Ellesandra to back off. Seeing Star react so immediately should have told her to shut up and just leave, before things got worse. Somehow, though, they just made her even more upset. Guilt leaked out of the mountain, and as Star tried to defend her actions, defend that she would do this with or without Ellesandra's permission in the future, Ellesandra was prepared to just leave. Cut the conversation before she did something stupid. And then there was that line. 'I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me.' The mountain broke open and, completely without thought, Ellesandra stepped directly up to Star. "And I've already had one charge give her life for mine, I will NOT have another do the same." She didn't even realize she was saying the words until after they were out. Such was the way anger worked; you spoke subconscious, not even considering the impact or truth of words. The pain as soon as they left her mouth hit hard. She took a step back, hardly holding in the sob that immediately bubbled up from the crack in said mountain. It didn't matter that Star wasn't talking about giving her life for Ellesandra, but just taking her pain and wounds. To her, in this moment, they were one and the same. Star would be taking the punishment that should be Ellesandra's. She couldn't be here with Star, who she knew would be able to see how the guilt and pain completely consumed her. She spun and slammed the door shut behind her before Star could try to follow out, not even looking at Morrun or Lissana as she left the hut. She'd held back the sob just barely, but there were tears on her cheeks. She didn't make her way to her room though, figuring if Star followed she'd assume that's where Ellesandra went. No, she went straight for the meadow, hoping it would be mostly empty that evening.

Quite a lot of things fell into place in that moment for Star. Her eyes widened. Shock filled her. She was in no state to stop Ellesandra. No state to say anything. To realize that...For Ellesandra, Star's staunch conviction, the desire to do whatever was necessary to care for the knight...It played right into their guilt, into the pain that the knight felt. That every time Star showed valiance in the face of danger, it was undoubtedly making Ellesandra fear that history would repeat itself. Star didn't want to die, but...As Ellesandra slammed the door and stormed out, Star had to sit with her own thoughts and decide...If it came to it, would she give her life for Ellesandra? Would that answer change, knowing they already had someone sacrifice themselves for them? A lot was revealed about the knight's actions without it being directly revealed. And Star would remain in her room for a short while. An hour or so. But the empath was, by some estimations...Incorrigible. Time was needed, yes. But so were apologies. And try as Ellesandra might to elude Star, it remained the unfortunate truth that...A strong emotion was felt by Ellesandra. Very strong. And the stronger an emotion, the more it could guide Star. So she followed them. It was just past sundown. The early beginnings of night, with an orange haze still bleeding over the horizon as it crest over the pond of the meadow. No others were there. All had returned to their homes. And Ellesandra was free to have it to themselves. But after about an hour, Star found her way there. And if Ellesandra was still present, Star stayed out of sight initially. Somewhere close, but not intruding, as if needing to make a final decision on her plan to either walk over and speak, or do something else.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had been thankful it was empty when she arrived. She was laying down in the meadow, not far from where they had been laying just earlier that day. It was a good thing that Star could see emotion, as far away it might be hard to see her, and she was keeping quiet in her sobs. Still, they were sobs. She was curled up on her side, knees pulled up to her chest and her face buried in them. She was trying her best to put the lid back on, to take the guilt and the grief and shove them back down, back into the mountain and just pretend they didn't exist. She couldn't, though. Not entirely. The memory of Marigold looking up into her captors faces. A mix of fear and determination before the blade fell. Ellesandra was wracked with the guilt, and the pain wasn't like one who had lost a charge they weren't close to. It was heartbreak, the feeling that one who had loved another felt at their death. With Stars abilities to see emotions, it was like a major beacon pointing her to where Ellesandra was. And by the time Star found her, she had made little progress in shoring up the hole that had formed. The physical pain that encompassed the emotional, the feeling that her chest was being literally ripped open. Old wounds, the same ones experienced that day, throbbed. Her right arm, her left side, and her left shoulder. But the physical pain was nothing compared to the turmoil that three years of repressing the grief and guilt brought. Ellesandra had never properly processed her death; she hadn't let herself. On the best of days, she pretended it didn't happen. That she was out on a mission, that was it. On the worst, she distracted herself from the guilt. Whatever would do, however she could. She didn't let herself feel it, and when she suddenly admitted to that to Star. That Marigold had died to save her, she just couldn't anymore. It was the first time she'd admitted it in more than her dreams or her thoughts, and putting words to it had made it real.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
It killed Star to see the knight in such a state. To be so stricken, so alone...Star would not stand for it. Ellesandra did not know it, but their anger, their sorrow, their grief, it all left a long, wispy trail of emotion and memory on the aether that Star followed. One she could read. One she could cradle against her and feel the emotion, take unto herself the memory that brought such pain into existence. But she recalled her promise to Ellesandra. She did not dive into the memory, even if it was right in front of her. It was a breach of their trust to do so. She moved out from her place out of sight. Her own tears were plentiful, though she held her sobs in. Her pain was for Ellesandra; this moment was not about her or how she hurt, it was entirely about them. She moved to where they were laying. She laid before them. Close, but not too close. She laid on her side, though not hugging her legs to her chest to hide. She didn't need Ellesandra to notice her or react. Even if it was just that she was here with them, in this moment, so they wouldn't have to be alone as they faced such pain...That was enough. Though of course, if they did notice her, she was sure to raise the arm not pinned under her side to leave open the same comfort to Ellesandra that they offered her, even if she knew the knight was far less likely to accept such physical comforts, least of all from Star herself given what happened with that contact.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The emotions rolled from Ellesandra in waves. Guilt, pain, sorrow, guilt again. The guilt was the strongest thing, influencing more pain and grief than just having had someone close to her die. That she felt fully responsible for the death was what truly hit Ellesandra hard; that she had been tasked to protect someone, and had failed so miserably at her job it had gotten her killed. Well, that wasn't entirely fair, objectively, but Ellesandra was anything but objective in regards to this. The sobs had slowed, but she still lay there, curled up on herself and silent tears running down her cheeks. Her eyes were closed and she was much too distracted to notice Star's approach, so there was no immediate reaction when Star lay down next to her. Ellesandra's face was mostly hidden, with her head down where her forehead pressed against the top of her knees. Through bangs of hair falling around the top of her head Star would be able to see the streaks of tears, and her knuckles were white with how hard she had been holding onto her own legs. With the lack of anyone she trusted or felt comfortable with holding her, Ellesandra held herself. Eventually, she shifted, a discomfort with how she was laying, and that is when she saw Star laying in front of her. Seeing Star obviously surprised Ellesandra and she jumped, her body all but leaving the ground for a moment in the intensity of her surprise, and her eyes gone wide. And then the shame and embarrassment hit, at how she'd reacted to Star, and that Star was now seeing her like this. No one saw her like this. She'd never broken down like this in a situation where anyone had access to her before. Seeing Star's arm raise, she looked at the arm, then Star for a moment, hand moving up to wipe at her face as if to try to make herself presentable. It was a moment of indecision. She wanted the physical comfort, but did she want that from Star? Not just because of the whole touching and emotions thing Star did, but she'd known star for...not even two days, at this point. And Star had already devolved Ellesandra into a sobbing mess. Her eyes moved down to her own body again and then without a word she turned so that her back was to Star, not wanting her to see Ellesandra this way. Not wanting her to see how broken she was inside, and didn't let anyone else see. The guilt was still there, even as it was now successfully being buried again. The start of another mountain; though this one would be significantly smaller.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star did expect a rejection. She didn't take it personally. She knew she was the exception rather than the rule to how quickly people became accustomed to hugging, to touching. It was very different for her, for an empath. It was an expression of her openness and trust in others, for Star had advantages others did not. A nigh flawless insight into someone's heart, into their motivations. A moment's study was all she needed to know if someone wished her harm, either directly or subtly. Ellesandra had no such guarantees. They were their own, only source of comfort. She was okay with this for now. She wanted more, of course. But she wouldn't demand it. She could only show it with her tears, with her sorrow, with the depths of sympathy in her eyes. "I am so...So...So sorry, Ellesandra," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She kept her sobs subdued, still. "For...So many things."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond, not at first. She wasn't able to, opening her mouth and feeling just a tight throat and air whistling out. It took her a few moments of trying to calm her emotions to be able to force her throat to loosen up enough to speak. "Don't...apologize for something that is not your fault, Star, or you had no way of knowing." Ellesandra pulled her knees up to her chest again, arms wrapping around them. She was the one who hadn't told anyone anything. Star couldn't be held accountable for saying something that triggered Ellesandra when she had no way of knowing it would. And Star didn't actually do anything wrong, either. She was just trying to do what she thought was right, even if Ellesandra still had a smoldering flame of anger at her taking her pain without discussion. She placed her forehead on her knees, adopting the same position Star had seen her in when she approached, just with her back to Star now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was reassured slightly by Ellesandra speaking at all. Not so much by their words; she cared little for absolution, she knew Ellesandra was hurt, and her actions, knowing or not, were at least partly to blame. Star had her stubborn moments, certainly. But she was quicker than most to step back and accept guilt unto herself under most circumstance. Hardly perfect, but...A reminder of what was important, a reminder of the humanity of the moment, was all it took to center herself again here. To remember what mattered. "I will apologize," she said, her voice still soft, yet carrying that selfsame emotional conviction. "...Because someone has to. Your tears have no business falling alone." She paused. She had to choose her words carefully, with Ellesandra so obviously vulnerable. "I was so caught up in my own fears that it blinded me to yours. And I've far less excuse than most for that. I...Was so worried that you would keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing yourself to the point that you would break, to the point that I wouldn't be able to save you...It made me feel...Desperate. It's...No excuse. Just an explanation. So you know that though every action I've taken, I've kept you in my mind. I know the things I do can seem...Reckless. Thoughtless, even. And I can promise you it's nowhere near the truth, but...I know that can't stop that deep fear in you. Just like it can't stop it in me. So...I promise all the things I've said, still. I promise I won't pry. I promise, however, that I'll still be here, every step of the way. And that I want to know...I want to be here for you. But that I'll let you decide what to share with me." A pause for breath. "...And most of all I promise that I'll never stop fighting to stay alive. I won't let death claim me. I can't. And as much as you'll let me...I'll rely on you to make that a reality." Another brief pause. "I...Didn't come here to make you talk, though. I didn't come here to make you do anything. So you don't...Have to say anything. I just hope you'll let me stay with you, so you don't have to have to cry alone. Because my heart can't bear that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She waited, listening to Star but not really knowing what to respond to. And was there even an expectation of a response? Probably not. She appreciated that Star promised not to pry, but that still didn't make her feel comfortable with touching Star. Ellesandra didn't let anyone touch her, really; she didn't let herself be vulnerable like that, and that wasn't even considering Star's ability which immediately made it so that the walls Ellesandra did have up meant absolutely nothing. It didn't matter how good she was at hiding her emotions from everyday people; Star could literally see right through her when it came to that. So touching Star made her feel even more vulnerable than just a normal hug. The previous embrace as Star broke down earlier had been more than Ellesandra was comfortable with, but something she felt like she should do, was expected and appropriate for the situation. Now? As much as she might internally want Star to reach out and touch her back, or even cuddle up against her and hold her, she also hated the idea. And so, she laid there as she worked to finish calming herself back down. To push her emotions down enough that she could breath and exist normally again. Her chest still ached from it; the pain was still there, she couldn't get rid of it entirely. She could, however, get rid of the worst of it. Her throat was sore with the intensity of the crying at first, and her eyes puffy and red. Her nose was runny and she sniffed, irritated at it. Finally, she moved to stand up. She didn't look at Star, keeping her face turned away, back to her while she looked up at the sky. "We did say we'd come see the stars tonight." She murmured, as if that had been the reason they'd been out there - not because Ellesandra had broken down, but because they were keeping up on their promise to star watch in the meadow.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had waited with Ellesandra without another word. Without pushing herself onto them. She just watched their emotions, the turmoil, and the repression. She disagreed with that repression. It made her want to do something drastic again. To pin Ellesandra down and scream at them to stop it, to let themselves feel their emotions instead of ignoring them. But there was only so much she could push the knight before she started pushing them away with what she thought to be caring actions. It meant nothing if it evoked a defensive response that could not be overcome with sincerity and concern. "We did," she said softly to Ellesandra, then moved onto her back, looking up at the stars. "...So won't you lay with me a short while and look at them?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Hadn't she been laying here enough, crying? The thought passed her mind, and how much she just wanted to go back to her room at the inn and curl up on her bed. Maybe cry a little more, though she doubted she had anything left in her. How could one have so many tears? She glanced at Star out of the corner of her eye and took a deep breath, before moving to sit down in the meadow nearby. It wasn't laying down next to Star, but she was still keeping her company, and her eyes turned upwards towards the sky nonetheless. She sat with most of her weight on her rump, knees brought up but spread open this time, with her arms wrapped around them widely and hands held together in front of her. Her head was tilted back, eyes tracing some of the constellations she knew - which weren't many. "Any constellations or stars or anything of particular importance to your family? With your naming theme being all celestial objects like that, that is." There. Conversation that was completely neutral to the pain Ellesandra felt. Trying to be normal.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star smiled quietly. "...The night sky is different in my homeland. I was young enough at the time that the memories aren't as clear as they could be but...The constellations here aren't the same. I'll show you the constellation named after the hero of my realm when we get there. It's called 'Purity'. It's a symbol of hope. The stars align to spread out, curling slightly upward, with pockets of stars in vaguely straight lines extending out from the other stars. It looks like a pair of angel wings. It's a beautiful sight." She smiled, though her eyes were still misty. "I don't know the constellations here, despite my time here. It's not my home. Though being away from where I was born so long, and with the place I was born doubtlessly left as nothing but overgrown ruins now...I don't know if I can rightly call that place home, either. I haven't had a place to call home since I was cast away." She paused, then shook her head. "Gods...Sorry. You just asked about the stars, didn't you?" She sighed. "...They're beautiful, here. Just like you said they would be."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced sideways at Star as she talked about home, briefly, before returning her eyes up to the stars. "A constellation of angelic wings, huh?" A symbol of hope. She had to fight back the urge to scoff at the idea. She lowered her gaze back down to the meadow, looking out over it in what light was provided by the stars and the moon that evening. "Stop apologizing when it's not necessary, Star. Stand up for yourself and take up the space you need, or want." She would slowly break that habit of Star, apologizing for unnecessary things, if she stayed with Star very long. Or at least, that was her goal. "Home can be anywhere, or someone. Right now, it sounds like your mom is your home, and you're looking to return to her. If you get there and find that home has been destroyed, you'll grieve, and then you'll find a new home. It's transitory, isn't it?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star pouted a little when Ellesandra chided her for apologizing. It was hardly a big deal, so it was taken with a light heart rather than some serious admonishment of her character. "You should probably think twice before you encourage me to be even more stubborn against you, you know," she said with a glance over at the knight in turn. "I don't know if you realize how much I already hold back around you. I know I'm not exactly normal in that regard, but I've never been one to be shy about emotion." She let her gaze linger on Ellesandra for a while with those words. Not an overly heavy tone, but...That selfsame conviction appeared again here. That was her domain. The thing she stood for, even as it balanced against respecting Ellesandra's boundaries. "If I gave all that my heart desired to assert myself with you, well...You'd probably go running for the hills. I can be awfully scary when it comes to emotional matters," she said, offering a playful smile. Star? Scary? Hard to imagine. But she did listen to the words about home, bringing her eyes back to the stars above. "...It is, you're right. We're just guests in the lives of so many people that we meet. We might never see this place again. And there might not be a home waiting for me where we're going." She didn't go anywhere with those words. Just an echo of what they said, perhaps to affirm it all in her heart as she stared at the night sky. A pensive air came over her. It'd be easy to tell, as it generally was with Star, what she was feeling. Longing, perhaps. Depth of thought. A pain bubbling in her, one she was well familiar with. It hurt, still, clearly. Her desire to return home. To close this chapter of her life, so she could grieve if she must, and move forward again.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She pursed her lips at the stubborn comment. Did she want Star to be more stubborn? Ellesandra was silent as Star went on about her emotions, and home. There was a sudden defensiveness to her and she had to fight the urge to slide a little further away from Star. Leaning forward, she repositioned so she could place her chin atop her knees, gazing out over the meadow. "Assert your own emotions as much as you want." She said, eventually. "But I've drawn a firm boundary around my own. And I expect you to respect that boundary, as much as your powers allow you to." They would certainly make Star respecting her boundary hard, and Ellesandra recognized that. Normally, her boundary involved not prying into her emotions at all, but it seemed that was all but impossible for Star. Still, there was restraint Star had seemed to show. Ellesandra wasn't going to force her to hold herself back, but she would encourage said restraint in regards to herself. "We should get back, though. Long day tomorrow and I'm sure we both need the rest to prepare. Especially you with needing to meditate to ensure you are fully prepared for what you might be asked to do tomorrow."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star just bore a grin at Ellesandra's words. She refrained from comment, despite mentally imagining Ellesandra saying 'assert yourself! Claim what you want!' followed immediately by 'no wait not like that'. A terribly oversimplified thought made just for amusement, and just for her to hold onto. Something that might have Ellesandra wondering what she found so amusing, but beyond that she rose up to a seated position. She nodded. "I know. But it was important to me that I be with you in this moment. You're important to me, and I'll always do all I can to make sure you know that." She said that, then rose up to her feet, moving immediately towards where she would be sleeping, though she did look over her shoulder and smile. "Good night, Ellesandra. I'll see you at dawn. Sleep well."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Her eyes narrowed at Star as she walked away. Ellesandra was important to her, after just two days? "Foolish." She muttered to herself, quiet enough to ensure Star didn't hear her. There was disbelief there, then irritation at Star putting herself at risk like that. To care for someone so quickly was an easy way to get yourself hurt, even if Star could see someone's intentions. People might not intend to hurt others, but they did it all the time anyways. She started her walk back to the Inn, trailing Star long enough to see that she made it back to Morrun's place safely, and then taking the path Morrun had shown her the night before to the Inn to settle in for the night. She did exactly as she'd wanted to before, locking her door then curling up in her bed, covers thrown over her head, and let herself cry more. The remaining pain and guilt that she hadn't been able to repress released, and she finally cried herself to sleep. In the morning, her head ached. Her sinuses were clogged from the crying last night and her eyes were still puffy and red. She slipped out of the covers and began getting ready for the day, doing what she could with water provided to clear up her face so she didn't look like she'd spent the whole night crying despite having done so. She had woken at the first rays of the sun shining through the window, but that meant she hadn't had much time to get ready and put her armor on before they would be leaving most likely. She'd planned to wake earlier, but exhausted eyes from last night had prevented that. So it was about last minute that Ellesandra arrived to Morrun's with her pack on her back, armor on, hair up in a high ponytail, and rapier strapped to her right hip like normal, knocking at the front door if they weren't already outside.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra's restlessness was helped little by their dream. It was not one where the woman had lucidity, so it was easier to chalk up to simply tumults of the mind. But in this dream, Ellesandra wandered through a forest that was possessed by endless darkness. No passage out. No certainty of the way forward. And lurking in the edge of Ellesandra's periphery every few minutes was that same inky shadow. That black mass of darkness that stood with the reaper's scythe. A foreboding presence. One that watched, silently. One that did not impede, but its displeasure was clear. It never attacked. It simply watched, then vanished if observed. It was unmistakably the same entity that had tormented Ellesandra on the previous night. But was the demon just a manifestation of Ellesandra's repressed fears, or something else? It would be impossible to know. Ellesandra could only know that even when pushing forward, retreating, attacking, or calling out to this black monster, it did not respond. It vanished before the knight could do anything, always out of reach, yet always watching. Ellesandra would wake in time, granting reprieve from the endless black forest. Their sleep was not the most restful with less time than they might need, but it wasn't particularly disturbed. Perhaps even a break from recurring nightmares; likely less scary than seeing Marigold in their dreams. The result was an almost fully refreshing slumber, but with lingering fatigue to shake off. Some time walking would do the trick. Ellesandra's knock was met with a swift answer. It was breakfast time again, and some notice had been taken of the knight's desires. Ellesandra's plate was given an extra helping of breakfast meats in the way of sausage and bacon, while Star's had a smaller helping of these while piling it more full of fruit and vegetable. Lissana was clearly paying attention. Morrun had syrup-soaked pancakes again, which he ate with glee. Smalltalk was the air for the morning, unless the knight had specific questions or subjects to raise. If not, the group was destined to part ways here, and Morrun and Lissana were sure to send the two off with some prepared bundles of rations. Fruit preserves, nuts, berries, cured meats, even two portions of salted cuts of meat that would last a day or so on the road without spoiling to serve as a good night's meal over a campfire if nothing else could be secured. There was an obvious priority to what would need to be eaten first, but it certainly beat roasted squirrel in terms of quality. It would be the last chance the two had to say goodbye unless they chose to return to this grove another day, or some time in the future.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra definitely hadn't slept well, with the paranoia of that shadow lurking everywhere. And now in the waking world, Ellesandra's paranoia continued. The shadow was too coincidental, to be in both dreams, for Ellesandra to shrug it off. Now, she was looking around, keeping an eye out and watching the shadows as she'd gone to Morrun's, and even while eating. Ellesandra stared at the extra meat on her plate for a moment, blinking a few times and looking over to Lissana in confusion, before eating it anyways. She was quiet throughout the breakfast, introspective and obviously tired, and when they were given all of the supplies for the road, she smiled at Lissana and Morrun politely in thanks. Her dreams had been bothering her, leading her to be even more quiet than normal that morning. As they prepared to go, Ellesandra was looking around, then looking to Star. "Are we supposed to be meeting up with anyone this morning?" As compared to last night, Ellesandra's emotions looked much better controlled and repressed. The mountain was now significantly smaller, and there was a small hole in it that Ellesandra didn't even notice, but the emotions were still held down under it. The main emotions today were a combination of embarrassment, at how she'd acted the night before and how Star had seen her, combined with that paranoia, and concern for Star if something went wrong here.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had noticed, obviously, that something was different. Ellesandra wasn't themselves, but to some degree that was to be expected given the night prior. Star kept up some smalltalk during breakfast. The provisions were taken with humble thanks, and hugs were given to both of the elves before departing. They didn't seem to react to the touch. Perhaps they already knew what it was like to touch Star? Either way, she smiled at her companion, concern in her eyes but one that was passive. There were other things to focus on at the moment, and time to talk on the road. She nodded. "The guard is gathering at the gate. We should head there. The departure will begin in an hour or so, so we're in no rush to be among the group, but there might be an address to hear before that." Star then began to lead the way to the gate, with Ellesandra in tow. But along the way, well, she couldn't help but ask: "...Is...Everything all right, Ellesandra? I mean, aside from the obvious from last night. You seem...On edge." More than seem, she could see it. "Is it just worries about the fight ahead of us?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched the hugs with eyebrows raised. So many people were okay just randomly touching someone they hardly knew; Ellesandra couldn't understand it. Even before the incident, only a rare few were allowed to get close and hug Ellesandra like that. She shook her head, following Star towards the gate and keeping her eye out, when Star asked about her being on edge. "I -" To say she had dreams of something in the shadows? Biting her lip, she glanced sideways at Star, then back to the road ahead of them. "I have a gut feeling something bad might happen, so I'm on guard." It wasn't a lie, persay. It wasn't the whole truth either, though, and Ellesandra knew that Star would be able to tell that. Even without the ability to see emotions, Ellesandra was being too paranoid and guarded to just have a 'bad gut feeling'. Specifically, Ellesandra was watching the shadows, not specific people. She had a bad gut feeling that the shadow wasn't just a dream, considering it had been in two different dreams now. She had a bad feeling it meant more, though Ellesandra didn't know what exactly. Maybe the threat wouldn't be today at all, maybe it would be later, but she wasn't going to let her guard down and have it appear from the shadows without her knowing.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star could very easily tell that the answer was deflective. She frowned. She could see that there was more to the answer, though it did seem to be at least hinting at the truth. The unease she could see in the knight was a solid indication of that much. "I don't suppose you'd care to elaborate? If you have something in mind, it might be prudent to share. Something that I might be able to keep an eye out for as well. I don't expect much to go wrong today but...If I can know of any potential dangers, even if it's just a feeling...Two pairs of eyes are better than one. I take...Your worries seriously, you know. Not that I need any more reason to look out for my own self-preservation, but you being distracted could cause its own problems. If I know what you're worried about, I'll be able to watch and call out to you." A specific decision to frame it as her looking to Ellesandra for help, rather than facing the danger herself. She certainly seemed to have taken Ellesandra's fears seriously.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She pursed her lips together. Damnit, Star was making sense. Sighing, she looked around again to ensure no one could just overhear. It felt a little childish, admitting she was on edge because of dreams. "I've had...bad dreams the past two nights. It's not unusual; I do have recurring nightmares, but they both involved something completely new this time. A shadow that seemed to imply you were in danger. The first night it did, anyways. Last night, it was just...following me. Everywhere I went, it was there, somewhere in the shadows, watching. The first night I thought was just a strange nightmare, but that the same shadow was there for a second night in an entirely different dream, not recurring, has me concerned it might be something magical and not just imaginative." There was concern that Star would just laugh at her for being scared of her dreams, but it was minor. If she was then - who gave a damn, right? Ellesandra was taking her job seriously, and right now that seemed to be a potential, real threat. She was going to treat it as such and if she were more paranoid than normal on a day they were potentially marching into a battle, well, that wasn't really a bad thing was it?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star frowned at the revelation. "...Hm. I recall Nina telling me she had similar experiences in the past. I had thought it was related to her trauma, however, as neither of us ever encountered such a thing in our travels. But for you to experience it too...It can't be a coincidence. Tell me, did the shadow wield a scythe? That was the only other detail that Nina conveyed to me as significant." Hardly one to laugh at the news, Star was clearly taking it very seriously, and would have even if not for the past correlation. "I don't want to make you feel I'm dismissing your concerns, and I'll certainly be on the lookout too...But I hope it's reassuring to hear that we were traveling for years and didn't encounter such a being, whatever it was. It might be an entity that is contained within dreams, but...I'd rather not speculate with so little information."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra came up to a halt when Star mentioned the scythe. She turned concerned eyes onto Star, reaching out to stop Star from walking as well with a brief touch to her arm and ensure they faced eachother. "The scythe didn't make an appearance last night, but the night before it did. It was going to cut you clean in two. And said that you were in danger and would die on your journey." Had her and Nina, Star's previous guardian, had encounters with the same creature? Why was the creature warning Star's guardians but not her? She crossed her arms, eyes narrowing at Star herself. For a brief moment, there had been suspicion that it was Star's doing, but she quickly waved that away. While technically possible, she couldn't imagine Star manipulating someone like that. And Star didn't know Marigold, so how would she have been able to see that in order to play on those emotions in the dream? Unless Star could see more than she'd let on...suspicion rose again, but was shoved down. "It might be reassuring that in years you two didn't encounter it, but the fact it reached out to both your previous guardian and myself is more than coincidence, Star."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star nodded. "I'm certainly not delighted by that news either," she said, showing a flash of...Concern? Fear? A bit of both. "Like I said. I will be vigilant. I'd dismissed the danger before, but I can see that whatever it is has some interest in those around me, if not specifically me myself. I'll be on guard." She did seem a bit shaken, but it had been clear many times over that Star wasn't one to let fear grip her. She sought to master her own emotions, after all, and serenity and calm were literally exuded from her very aura, so any actual show of fear was rare from her thus far. She stayed in place as long as Ellesandra did, not wanting to rush them if they wanted to discuss further. "I won't let any pirates have my head, neither will I a dark spectre. If it is a threat...We will face it together, and I will support you. I won't face it alone, if it is something to be faced. I hope you'll take the same stance."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt even more disturbed, now that she knew this wasn't limited to just her own dreams. The image of of the shadow's scythe cutting towards marigold, then star, then marigold, then star - the pain from last night seeped out of that hole, just a little and Ellesandra winced at the imagery that came into her mind. No, she wasn't going to let the reminder cause her to focus on those emotions again. A deep breath was taken, before she nodded and began walking again. "Well, my job is your protection, so I expect you to run and trust me not to martyr myself if I tell you to run." She didn't actually expect Star to do that. She hoped Star would, but did she trust Star to put her own life over potentially Ellesandra's? No. She fully expected Star would disobey a request like that and knock her over the head for even making it, but Ellesandra would at the very least try, in a situation like that. They hadn't really fought together enough, or at all minus that initial interaction when Ellesandra first stumbled upon Star, for Ellesandra to feel comfortable and like they were a team in battle. It would be a while, before that happened most likely. "Just try not to exhaust yourself so much I need to carry you out of danger though." A teasing note, to lighten the mood.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I do trust you. And I trust you not to tell me to leave unless it's an absolute last resort. You're not allowed to die on me, either," she said, meeting their demand with her own. Obviously neither one could help it if death came for them with overwhelming force. But the understanding the two were trying to find with one another was to do all they could to live. Both had seen too much death of the ones filling the opposite role, even if that amount was a single, irreplaceable person. She then smiled at the teasing note. "Emergencies only, promise, even if you do give a good piggy-back ride," she said, raising a hand up as if swearing an oath on the matter as her smile grew. With that settled, and the mood a tiny bit lighter, she moved along with Ellesandra to the gate. It was time to make their move. And move they would; the gathering at the gate was an impressive number of soldiers. Enough to vaguely match the numbers of the pirates, based on estimations. Walking around the city and seeing what sort of ship the pirates had, there were in the ballpark of fifty pirates, not counting the five dead ones. Looking around, there were just about thirty five elves gathered, most of which had both a longbow and a shortsword for armaments. Three of these elves were wearing green robes instead of leather armor, identifying them as the healers. Star moved to stand with them; around them was Ellesandra's company, seven elves with simple spears and iron kite shields, as well as longbows. The rear guard seemed more specifically focused on close combat, with the remaining elves looking specifically geared for longer range combat. A few at the front were donning half-plate with two sheathed shortswords. Not a siege army by any measure, but certainly a force to be reckoned with. The directions were delivered by an older, though gracefully aged elven man who spoke of sanctity of the grove, and many of the points that Star had touched on, with callout specifically to how they had harmed a respected member of the grove in Lissana. The knowledge that one of their own had been harmed did seem to ignite a fire in the standing men and women, which was unlikely to surprise given the communal nature of this settlement. There was discussion that the elite guard would remain at the grove to keep the civilians secure, delivered with a line about not fretting for home while purging the lawless threats of their neighbors. Of course, the entire speech was delivered in elvish, so there was a chance Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it! Star certainly did, keeping a smile about her as she listened. But before long, the speech was over, and the group was on the move. Orders were relayed, the group split into smaller teams and moved together, with a few select individuals lugging large packs, presumably of supplies and/or food. One of the elven men standing at the front stayed back to join with the others of the rear guard, presumably the team commander. He specifically nodded to Ellesandra, acknowledging them as part of the fighting force, but didn't give any specific instruction other than motioning for the rear guard and the healers to follow. The guardsman naturally took up position both in front and behind the healers, ensuring they were the most heavily protected; the bulk of the forward force was the general forces, so most of the rear guard stayed behind to keep the squishy healers surrounded. As standard as things came, if it wasn't for the threat of the shadow that had Ellesandra so paranoid, it might even border on boring.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, accepting what Star said. She had no plan to just off and die for no reason, if she could avoid the death. She quickly identified which group was the healers, and followed Star over to them. Her eyes roamed the rear guard, sizing up all of the elves there while the speech was being made. Not knowing elven, Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it. Well, okay she might have caught one or two words just from hearing them multiple times in travel, but nothing to actually understand what was being said. The nod from the team commander caused a nod to be given in return, and Ellesandra moved to walk off to the side. Staying with Star directly would look like a lack of trust in the guards and would likely impede on her ability to interact with the other healers and make any plans necessary there; they needed to meet and trust one another and such for what might be coming up. The same could be said for Ellesandra and the rest of the rear guard, but she didn't try to integrate with them. A well formed company didn't need a stray mercenary stepping in and ruining any of their organization. Ellesandra instead walked off to the side, where she could easily see Star and get to her if something were to happen, but also keep an eye out around them. With the threat of the shadow, Ellesandra kept her guard up despite the number of soldiers around. None of them were looking for something in the shadows, but Ellesandra - and maybe Star - were. So for the entire trip, Ellesandra lightly rested her hand on her rapier and watched, used to long treks like this.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The trip took until dusk. There were multiple organized stops for the soldiers to take half an hour to tend to personal business in the woods, rest their feet, and take some time to eat. There was no point arriving exhausted and dying. Everyone had to be alert on arrival, and the instructions given ensured they would be. Star seemed content to chat with the other elves, though she did so in elvish, as seemed to be the preferred language for obvious reasons. A confirmation that Star did indeed speed more than just common. She was ever the social butterfly, though even in elvish it would easy to pick up on the shy mannerisms of the mystic. Eager to be close to others and be merry, but with that selfsame demure attitude. Star did look around at times, and was sure to check in with Ellesandra during the rest stops. Just to confirm they hadn't seen anything, and to assess their emotional state. Nothing unusual there, or during the entire trip. So it came. The moment of assault. The town was cloaked in the fading light of the nearly set sun, people were returning to their homes. A small contingent of elves moved from the main force and into the city, bows at the ready and arrows nocked. They clung to the walls, moved through the shadows. An initial force that capitalized on the element of surprise, seeking to find locations and take out targets of opportunity in the city. The healers, including Star, set up off the main road in a medium sized clearing with easy access from the road, but the elvish spellcasters cast some magic upon the other edges of the clearing which raised thorny vines up through the gaps in the trees, sealing the clearing to a single entry while allowing in an emergency for the spell to be undone and retreat into the forest. Naturally, the rear guard commander calmly issued orders to his force to station around the entrance to the clearing, but out of sight. Vigilant, but not telegraphing the location. Two of them ascended up into trees to conceal themselves and act as scouts, some others took up posts amidst the trees. The captain instructed Ellesandra and two other elves to act as ones who would receive, guard, and direct wounded back to the guarded clearing. This also ensured that Ellesandra would have view over the city, as the port city was on mildly lower elevation by the water than its surrounding landscape. Just as when approaching from the south, Ellesandra would have a view over a good portion of the city, its port, and the ships in port. Decently far away, to be certain. But that distance didn't stop the knight from feeling...Something. Something sinister lurked. Something dark. The creeping dread of the shadow was theirs to feel, despite the shadow being nowhere to be seen around them. Focusing on the feeling, it certainly did seem to be coming from the city. More specifically, somewhere amidst the pier, on one of the boats. Far enough away that it could not pose a true threat. But the sensation was the same. Was Ellesandra just being paranoid? Was it some trick? Some spell cast on them? It could be a million different things. But that distant, foreboding feeling was not coming from within. Something else was making the knight's spine tingle, making their skin rise with goosebumps..
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet for most of the trip. During the rests she'd greet Star and ensure she was holding up okay, not getting too tired from the march, and chat with a soldier in two in common when their curiosity got the better of them and they wanted to know who she was. She just introduced herself as Star's hired guard, a mercenary who travelled the lands and hired herself out to caravans, individual travelers like Star, and merchants who are concerned about bandits on the road. This seemed to cause them to dismiss her, which Ellesandra didn't mind at all. While she'd served in an army before, she hadn't actually spent much time marching with them because she'd quickly been pulled for personal guard duty and the work that went into being a soldier was very different than the work that went into being a guard. They were not interchangeable, at least not efficiently. They kept their eyes out throughout the march, accepting their stand-off status from the rest of the rear guard. She knew she'd just get in their way; even if they fought like the soldiers she'd been trained with, it had been too long. Plus, with them being elves and knowing the little she knew about how they tended to fight, she wouldn't be able to keep up with them in their own way. When they got to the location, Ellesandra had stayed back, frowning as her paranoia seemed to just increase at the sudden bad feeling she was getting. She nodded to the orders she'd been given, accepting them and not arguing or causing issue, but her eyes kept straying out towards the peer. That bad feeling felt way too similar to the shadow in her dreams, and she looked back towards where Star was. Could she feel it? Could she sense Ellesandra, if she looked? Ellesandra didn't quite know how her emotional sight worked, but with how they were currently separated and her being prepared to receive injured, she might not be able to talk to Star before the chaos began. Frowning down at the city again, watching as the elves did exactly as Ellesandra knew she couldn't do, she kept her hand resting on her rapier. The bad feeling didn't go away, and Ellesandra tried something. She didn't know if Star would be able to feel it or see it, not while Star wasn't actively looking at or paying attention to Ellesandra, but it was worth a shot. She tried to take the feeling of caution, the concern and paranoia that she was feeling, and focused solely on that feeling. It made it bigger, more worrisome for her, but also she was trying to make it look like a beacon for Star, so Star would know that Ellesandra was concerned about something. "Cursed emotions." She muttered to herself, not sure if she had done anything, and after only a moment or two of that deciding not to focus on it more so as to not send herself into a paranoid panic and attack the first movement she saw. She needed to be at least relatively cool-headed when the chaos broke out.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Had Ellesandra's plan worked? While the knight might not be able to be certain, the results were hard to argue. Star separated from her group, passing reassurances to those who looked concerned that she was leaving the protected area, to approach Ellesandra. Things were still calm. She might not get another chance, she surmised, to speak to the knight. And when she did approach, the knight's experiment would prove validated: "What's wrong?" Star asked as she walked up beside Ellesandra. She looked out over the city with no specific reaction forming upon her face, then back to the knight. Concern was upon her features. "Do you see something?" Seemed she had been able to see Ellesandra's beacon, and didn't seem to be picking up on the same sensation, unless it for some reason wasn't bothering her the same way it bothered Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced back at Star and her hand tightened on her rapier at the sudden words. She hadn't expected Star to actually approach and say anything, frowning and looking around at how she was no longer back in the protected encampment the rest of the healers were. The idea had been just to ensure Star was on the lookout, not letting her guard down. Still, best to just explain and get her back to where she was protected, right? Turning, Ellesandra pointed towards the pier, where she was feeling that odd sensation from. "I feel something bad from that direction. It...feels similar to the shadow. I just wanted to ensure you were keeping your guard up, so be careful." It was interesting that Star couldn't feel it, the one who could usually see emotions and such, but perhaps that wasn't too odd? Her previous guardian could see the shadow in her dreams, but Star hadn't been able to. Was it somehow haunting Star, but not directly? She didn't know, and honestly didn't know enough about creatures that might be able to do that, or other magics that would. She shifted uneasily, glancing around, and then back to Star. "So get back in there, I'll see you when we bring people in, but don't let your guard down just because there are guards all around you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked over to where Ellesandra pointed. Again, nothing specifically seemed to jump out at her, but she looked back to Ellesandra and nodded. "I understand," she said simply. "I'll keep an eye out. If there are any malevolent presences that come close, I will call for you." She smiled. A reminder that someone with ill-intent, even if there was some duplicitous scheme afoot, would not be able to sneak past her, as well as an assurance that she wouldn't do something dumb on her own. A reinforcement of her commitment to letting Ellesandra be her guardian. With that, she moved calmly back to the protected area. Some time then passed. The tension in the air rose as silence fell over the city. The covert beginnings of the operation were hard to read. Was everything going smoother than expected? Or had something gone wrong? The answer might never be known, but it was not overlong before the start of the chaos was upon them; a magical bolt of light shot up into the air, exploding high in the sky to shift into a massive beacon of light in the shape of the holy symbol of Corellon - a crescent moon with starry fixtures overlaid on the midsection of the crest. It was the signal to start the assault, clearly, as the elves set to charge in all at once rose their fists with a battle cry and began down into the city. The beacon hung high in the air, shining light down on the city that had been bathed in night by the time the assault began. Then, the beacon shuddered with magic, and the illusory roar of a dragon bellowed out from it. Screams from civilians could be heard as they ran from the roar to the safety of their homes. An effort to clear the streets and prevent innocents from being caught in the carnage. It was difficult to observe any direct encounters from the vantage point beyond the city limits, but the small dots of movement could be tracked in the sections of street that were visible. The pier was the most easily seen from beyond the city, and indeed the pirate ship had its own commotion. Pirates emerged onto the deck and began to pour out down the connected ramp to the dock, charging into the city to meet the elvish incursion. But it wasn't long before the wounded began to arrive; there was a clear effort from the elves to minimize loss of life on their side, as the soldiers that came back initially were sporting light wounds. Enough that they could keep fighting, just not at their best. A few debilitating injuries did make their way through after the first few, however, and the number of injuries certainly might strike Ellesandra as higher than expected. Were these the same idiotic, arrogant pirates they had faced? While these elvish soldiers were by no means trained enough to go toe to toe with a knight, they were still disciplined enough that working together to put down such a threat ought to be easier than the steady flow of injured made it seem. No dead had shown up quite yet, and many of those who were injured were capable of heading back into the city to fight the good fight some more, but with what was known about the enemy, it certainly might tickle at one's suspicion. Then, explosions began to resound from within the city. Loud ones. Bombs, of some sort. Loud enough to echo through the chaotic thrum of distant, shouting voices and blades meeting blades. Soon after the bombs started to sound, a heap of wounded began to arrive with grievous wounds - bones protruding from legs, limbs blown off, half-burnt faces and blackened leather armor filled with dozens of shards of ceramic. The first few dead. The frequency and number of injuries were quick to put a strain on the healers, including Star. A cursory glance would be all it would take to see the fatigue building on all of them. They were going to be tapped out before too long, and there didn't seem to be any end to the wounded, or the fight.  
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The calm before the storm was, in some ways, worse, than the fight itself. She watched, eyeing the town and waiting for it to happen. The feeling had never gone away, and she found her eyes straying towards the pier over and over, trying to figure out if it was ever moving closer to them, or at all. The illusory magic that broke out to signal the attack was impressive, causing Ellesandra's eyebrows to raise, but she didn't comment on it. A good way to get citizens off the street, even if it clearly signaled to the enemy something was going on. At first, as the few injured soldiers came in, Ellesandra was getting annoyed at the state of their wounds. This wasn't her encampment to give orders around though; she was just there to help and to guard Star, so she kept her complaints and irritation to herself. The concern was obvious, that these small wounds were going to tax the healers when it wasn't necessary and prevent them from being able to handle the larger and more dire wounds. Maybe the elves were assuming they wouldn't get many of those, but you didn't make assumptions like that when anything could go wrong in a fight. Ellesandra helped those who needed it over to the healers tents then came back to the front to do the same again, eyes flicking towards the battle frequently. The bombs exploding happened just as she was returning to the entrance and she paused, staring at the smoke rising in the air. "Willing to bet that wasn't us." She mumbled, uncaring if the other soldiers around her heard or not. She narrowed her eyes at the town, wondering how the pirates were putting up such a fight. Either they had known something was going on, they had a lot more numbers than was originally assumed, or they'd gotten reinforcements somewhere. Or maybe a combination of them. Any of these sounded bad for the elves though; had they potentially taken over the city's defenses and turned them inward onto the elves? She soon didn't have time to think about this as the more dire injuries were brought forward, moving quickly to help bring the injured soldiers into the tents as stable as possible to prevent pain before going out to get more. At this rate, the healers would be overwhelmed, and on her second trip back with a soldier who had bad burns and his shin bone sticking out of his leg, she stepped up next to wherever Star was and murmured - "If they haven't already, you need to convince the other healers to put off anyone who is obviously going to die or obviously not going to die and focus on the ones you can save. Healing every small cut isn't sustainable." Hopefully the healers knew that, but she at least wanted to ensure Star was following it. She knew how much Star hated seeing death, and the concern was there for her even through the caution and paranoia that still settled within Ellesandra.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was certainly a rising unease among the other soldiers around Ellesandra. The bombs, the flow of injuries, it had everyone Ellesandra could see wearing worry for their comrades and the success of the operation. They had intended to blitz in and scare the pirates off, then sink the fleeing ship. Pirates were selfish. They wouldn't lay down their lives to protect a captain they didn't respect or fear, and it was far more likely they would run than face death for someone else. Or at least, that was the common understanding, the one that this plan was based on. Yet so far, it didn't seem to be going that way. They were facing fierce resistance. Star looked up when she saw Ellesandra. The instruction given was met with a nod. "Mmn...We've been keeping our magical healing in reserve, using the supplies we brought for the lighter wounds, and stabilizing those we know we can't get back into the fight with what we have. But something is wrong, Ellesandra. The fight should have been over by now, shouldn't it?" she asked, looking at her knightly companion with dread in her eyes. She wasn't saying it, but the implication was there in her eyes. Was what Ellesandra had felt somehow responsible? The shadowy essence was still in the city, through it was no longer on the ship. It was...Roaming. Just as Star was asking this of Ellesandra, a shaken elvish soldier began to make a commotion with some of the rear guard. The man had blood over his face and leathers, and his right arm was limp and held by his left, suggesting it was broken. The elf had tears in his eyes as he screamed something in elvish at his comrade. The words might mean nothing, but the tone suggested a desperate plea of some sort.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pursed her lips and nodded. Yes, the fight should have been largely over by now, but obviously it wasn't. Obviously, something else was going on here. Turning to see the elven man yelling something in elvish at his comrade, she took a deep breath. "They should retreat and reconsider their situation. And that feeling...it's moving through the city now, Star." She mumbled. She had no sway over the elven commanders or soldiers, though. As much as she disliked the idea of the elven soldiers continuing to fight, she had been trained to follow orders in a situation like this. She hadn't been trained to be the one making the decisions, so for now she would go back to doing what she had been ordered to. For as long as there were still soldiers fighting and coming back, she would ensure they got back to the healers to at least be looked at, glancing over her shoulder at the town and keeping track of where the shadow was - or whatever the feeling was coming from, if it wasn't the shadow specifically.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a difficult look at Ellesandra when hearing their words. She obviously seemed inclined to agree, that further loss of life was not worth the cost. But she also had been the one to advocate for this. For her to go and ask for retreat now would not put her in good graces with the leaders. It wasn't her place. She just nodded to Ellesandra, with a look of guilt overtaking all else as she set about getting back to her duties. Was it a sunk cost situation? That some had died already, and it was now too late to give in? Was it that the lost life needed to become greater before the bleeding would stop? One could not know, but anyone familiar with elvish culture knew it to be a stubborn one, one which did not accept changing their mind easily. Were they going to fight to the last? Time would tell. But before such thoughts could be explored significantly, Ellesandra was perhaps the only one who would then feel the shadowy presence shift. Suddenly, instantly, it was close. Ellesandra and the rear guard stood where the ground leveled out after a lazy incline coming up from the city. The secured clearing was behind the rear guard, with a road running north-south past the city that joined perpendicularly with the road leading from the city. The T-shaped intersection of the wider, main dirt road and thinner road to the city was where the guard was stationed; the treeline was a handful of meters beyond the edge of the main road. And from the thin road, the one to the city, the shadowy presence encroached. It would not be long before it was revealed: The pirate captain himself, clad in a long black cloak that was open in front to reveal a bare, hairy chest soaked in blood, along with a feather-adorned black hat, sturdy black bottoms and heavy black boots. A single scimitar in one hand, and an eyepatch over one of his steely grey eyes that stared at the guardsman with contempt; his lips held a mocking grin behind the fuzz of his scraggly, long beard. The captain was flanked by four other men who looked to be pirates of some experience. "Right then boys, which one of these pointy eared fuckers you reckon killed me first mate, eh?" announced the captain as he walked, casually, up to the peak of the road to step onto level ground with the guard. Naturally, the guardsman were immediate in their response, forming a defensive line with a wide berth. They were there to fight to the death to defend the healers, but they relied on the first strike to come from the hidden rangers in the trees. Given the open hostility to these pirates, the hidden rangers did not hesitate. Two arrows flew straight and true at the captain the moment a shot was lined up. Yet as commendable as their alert attention to threats was, the captain responded with a thrust of his free hand forward. A magical pulse boomed from his presence, sending a forcible rush of air ahead of him; the arrows destined for his skull glowed with mana as they were sent flying back to their origin, striking each of the hidden rangers who fired them. Two dull thuds into the grass made clear that the arrows struck true, hurting or killing the hidden guardsman. With that, the captain smirked in this moment, sizing up the guards that stood between him and the healers in the back. The chaos, the roar of battle, resumed in the city. It was the moment before battle; Ellesandra could remain passive and wait for another to strike first, or she could lead the charge, or perhaps try to talk it out if she was so inclined. But the source of the shadow-presence in this area was clear: The captain was bathed in it, whatever it was. A dark, malevolent presence. Yet it wasn't as strong as the one Ellesandra encountered in their dream. It was an echo of it. A fraction of the presence. A part of it, but not the true self of the presence. Perhaps touched by the presence, or commanded by it. Its nature was difficult to discern, but the hatred that suffused it was undeniable. That the captain would kill them all unless stopped by force of words or blades, there was no doubt.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The moment that she suddenly felt the shadow closer, Ellesandra froze. She felt the caution and paranoia turn into concern for Star, but the shadow was still on the road; not in the encampment. Ellesandra's hand was on her rapier as she walked forward, giving away to the elven guards around her that something was wrong before they'd even seen the captain. When the captain appeared, Ellesandra felt her stomach turn. It was him, with the shadow. Was the shadow a creature attached to him, some sort of possession? Or some sort of cursed, magical artifact he was using? She eyed the shadow cloak he had, wondering if that was what it was, not moving as he shouted out about someone killing his first mate. She'd hoped the arrows sent would take care of him, but of course that would be too easy. She watched as him and his probably handpicked pirates stood across from the guards. Based on his magic, the rear guard were likely no match for him as a group. The other pirates certainly, but he would sew enough chaos that they would suffer heavy losses. Not to mention, Star had mentioned he was quite nasty, hadn't she? Taking a deep breath and steeling herself, Ellesandra stepped forward, to the side of the rear guard soldiers to ensure that if the captain used any magic as an attack rather than talking, she didn't have to worry about them getting hit by it too. "That would by myself. Unfortunately, your first mate was a little unwilling to let an unfortunate hostage go. Perhaps you would be smarter than him and retreat now? Unless you'd also like to have my rapier through your heart." It was a goad, to get him to turn to her or send one his men after her. Either way, she wanted to even the odds for the soldiers. She would prefer if he came after her, with her ability to potentially redirect his magic or counteract it, but she'd take whatever she could get. The elven soldiers had suffered enough at this man's hands, likely. The thuds that had resulted from the redirected arrows were proof of that. Still, Ellesandra hadn't drawn her rapier, left hand simply resting on it's hilt, body loose and ready to fight. She'd dueled plenty of times, and she'd also fought against bad odds before, too. She had the scars to prove it; and she wouldn't let him or his shadow get into the rear encampment where Star was.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra's words proved effective towards their goal. The captain rolled his shoulders. "Well then, I thank ye for making the search an easy one!" proclaimed the captain in his deep voice thick as the mud that clung to his boots. "Keep the knife ears busy, lads, leave the runt to me," he barked. The pirates around him then rushed forward to engage with the rear guard. Metal met metal as the fighting began with them, and while they rushed to meet each other, the captain approached Ellesandra who had purposefully put themselves off to the side. Goading the pirate was as easy as ever, it seemed. But that he was looking for a fight hardly was in question. As he walked towards Ellesandra, his imposing six-foot-four, muscle-bound figure carried the shadowy presence all around him. Its source was difficult to place. Attempts to focus on it were met with an elusive, guileful magic veil. As he drew closer, his free hand weaved magic, then thrust forward towards Ellesandra. The effect of the magic struck the knight instantly, though how effective it would be remained to be seen; the magic was that of the spell Compelled Duel, which if it succeeded in affecting Ellesandra would ensure it would be difficult for them to run away, and magically compel them to be unable to attack anyone but the pirate captain himself. Not that Ellesandra likely intended on doing so anyway, but the captain seemed quite intent on fighting the knight one-on-one to exact his vengeance. He also, clearly, had no idea what abilities Ellesandra had, given that he was pleased to throw a magical, targeted spell at her expecting it to work. Though depending on how versed Ellesandra was with magic, she might find his ability to cast that specific spell...Odd. It wasn't every day one encountered a pirate able to use magic, let alone a spell usually employed only by righteous paladins.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced at the elven soldiers when the captain ordered his men to attack them. Well, that was best case scenario for her. She got to fight the magic wielder and not have to worry about his henchmen, while the guards wouldn't have to worry about the captain. She didn't gave away that she was pleased with this turn of events, though, turning to eye the man approaching her. Slowly, she drew her rapier and held it out in front of her, setting herself in a battle stance. When he shoved his hand forward to cast at her, she smirked. The magic poured into her mind, and then spread throughout her body. While most people would immediately feel the full effect of the spell and the need to fight, it didn't effect Ellesandra the same way. There was no visible sign if the spell had any effect, nothing to throw him off his guard that all that really happened was she was more inclined to fight him than before. It wasn't like the spell 'failed', per say. It hit it's mark, and Ellesandra wanted to fight him more than she had before; not that the spell had been needed to make her want to do so rather than running. No, while she would still be able to run, she was less likely to do so; it would require more of a drastic situation than normal to make her decide to flee. But what the spell also did was fuel her mana reserves, and as it settled in, Ellesandra made the same signs with her right hand that she had when she first encountered Star. She'd ensured that there was enough distance between the captain and herself that she could get her defenses prepped, unless he was able to move and attack much faster than she'd expected. The haste spell settled in around her, a light yellow glow, which immediately made her second spell casting faster. While the light yellow glow soon settled into her skin to be very subtle, a more evident blue glow surrounded her form. A magical shield, one that would help her absorb and deflect incoming magical attacks. With the spells in place, Ellesandra eyed the man and prepared her defense. Unlike the other pirates she'd faced, she had to assume this man knew how to fight well - and dirty. So she would keep her eye out, and play defensive at first. Get the feel for how he fought, and use her speed and dexterity to slip in for a hit when he let his guard down.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain didn't seem to realize that something was amiss. He was getting his duel. It was just a little less...Compelled than it was voluntary. With that set, he let loose a chuckle at seeing the rapier. "Ol' Salteye was put down by that pointy stick, was 'e? Pathetic excuse fer a first mate," he muttered to himself, then dipped his hand into the pocket of his cloak, pulling out a ceramic sphere of some sort. He opened the fight by throwing this sphere at Ellesandra's feet, where it exploded and sent out jagged, rusty nails in all directions. Some even flying back to hit him, though they bounced off some unseen force and landed on the ground in front of him instead of hurting him. The blast itself was concussive enough to stagger, but the damage was far more likely to come from the shrapnel of metal and ceramic. But he didn't charge in blindly. He waited to see what Ellesandra did in response, keeping distance enough between them as he opened the fight to give him time to react to Ellesandra's counter. Or, well, what he assumed was enough, not knowing that speed was one of Ellesandra's greater strengths.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was good she'd taken the defensive, then, because if she'd been in motion to attack she wouldn't have been able to avoid the apparent grenade of shrapnel. Ellesandra had started moving as soon as she'd seen the item coming at her, not sure if it was magical in nature or not and what it might do. This put her out of the main concussive part of the blast, having circled around to the side quickly so that it only caused her to take a step back, but it didn't get her completely clear of the shrapnel. While her armor blocked a good amount, the tings seeming to pop off of the magically enchanted plate, Ellesandra gave up protection in some areas for ease of movement. One piece of shrapnel slammed into her left thigh, cutting deep into it, and another into the area just above her right elbow. This one was lucky, both that it was her right arm, and also because that arm had been thrown in front of her face, as the shrapnel otherwise would have hit hit her in the face instead. She quickly recovered, feeling the pain of both hits but neither of them debilitating by any means. Pushing off of the ground with her good leg, she shot forward quickly, rapier ahead of her to feint an attack at the Captain, and then to quickly withdraw and attack again. Ellesandra wasn't going for a killing blow, not expecting to be able to end the captain easily at all, but would take whatever openings he gave her. A cut to his arm, a slash across his thigh, or wherever he left open in her feint, careful not to commit to any attack in case he had his own magical protection or quick response and she needed to dance out of the way or move again to prevent getting hit herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain wore a wide smirk as the grenade went off and scored some hits. Then, he watched with his one eye as the knight encroached. The feint was successful, drawing the man to try to knock the blade away with the flat of his scimitar, only to have the draw-back and quick follow up score a clean strike across his arm. The cloak tore, and the slash left its mark on his arm to pour fresh crimson from the wound. Not terribly deep, and the man's arms were thick enough with muscle that it was unlikely to impede him to any significant degree. The swift strikes that followed earned another strike on his thigh and another at his side. The man was slow, but burly. The cuts were hitting, but he didn't cry out in pain or even grunt, as if the strikes had no effect. Of course, the effect was clear. He was bleeding. He just had a strong constitution. But with a low growl, the captain threw his blade-bearing arm out and upward, his eye aglow with red mana; in the wake of his wild swing at nothing came a forward rush of thunderous force; the magic of a Thunderwave that came out suddenly to blast Ellesandra back and leave their ears ringing. Whether or not her shield could absorb this or if she had the strength of balance to avoid being flung onto her back from it remained to be seen. This was certainly no ordinary pirate captain, regardless.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The hits scored were good; she was more than happy to wittle him down. Taking on someone who was obviously as physically strong as him one on one for a quick hit wasn't going to work; not with how small and physically weak Ellesandra was compared to him. While she had muscle, her right arm was all but useless under heavy weight, and she had no chance to compete with someone of his size in strength. Ellesandra didn't even try to move out of the way as she saw the red mana glow in his eye though, smiling. The thunder wave caused her to skid back about a foot and the force knocked the breath from her, but beyond that it's effect on her was not what the Captain surely expected. The magic slammed into Ellesandra - but not through her. The effect of it knocking her back was obviously reduced, the physical force being absorbed into her mana and shield, but what came after was Ellesandra's right hand waving back at the Captain as the magic that did get absorbed was sent right back out in his direction. Not being a targeted spell, it wasn't something that she aimed at him, but more in his general area. The effect was significantly reduced; probably only enough to make him take a step back if it took him by surprise, but Ellesandra was following up immediately afterwards with her rapier, looking to take advantage of this. The downside of redirecting area spells was that, as all redirects were about half as strong upon the return, area spells were significantly even less because the only bit that Ellesandra absorbed of the area spell was the bit that hit her. The positive, in this situation, was it was likely to take an enemy by surprise. Ellesandra herself felt the wear in her body from the redirect. It wasn't easy to do, or light on her to do so - and the more powerful the magic, the more it effected her. There was a limit to how much she could absorb, which is where her magical shield came in to help deflect the remaining bit. But if a spell was too powerful and Ellesandra tried to absorb or redirect it, it was still liable to punch straight through her resistance and seriously injure her - and even if not, the forced flow of magic that was not hers through her body was a quick way to wear her magically out. So when Ellesandra stepped forward with the rapier, looking to take advantage of the surprise, she aimed at places that would have a serious impact. She doubted he'd be taken so off guard to go for a killing strike, but one placed in the crook of his elbow, or his underarm where it would limit his arm movement and cause continued pain if he swung his sword? Those were her targets.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain initially smiled upon seeing the knight sent back a few feet, and took a step in to capitalize on that, only to have the magic indeed catching him off guard in thinking he had the advantage. The result being that the counter wave that hit him knocked him off balance, enough to make that step forward turn into a swift step back to keep him from toppling over. He was wide open for a moment, but swift enough to regain his composure that he could get a last-minute reaction to impact the knight's advance. So it was, her target for his elbow struck true. Their blade struck swift and whether slash or thrust was true enough to strike to the bone. A solid hit. And yet, the captain remained unfazed. No lethargy or impedance could be observed in his motions as he gave a few swings with his scimitar mostly aimed at forcing Ellesandra back, for staying close while he swung would invite his experienced hand to trade blow for blow and give the knight a wound of their own. To play smart and patient demanded they step back, but if Ellesandra continued to aggress, then they would certainly suffer a slash across an unarmored part of their frame for whatever aggression they sought to impose. With his elbow liberally leaking blood, it was either a feat of constitution on par with a raging barbarian, or something else that kept him from showing the effects. Perhaps time was all it needed. For the moment, the captain was growing increasingly impatient with this dance, and took this moment to fish into his pocket with his free hand again. Last time it was a bomb. This time, his hand flew from his pocket with a fist full of some glittering dust, and as he released it towards Ellesandra it exploded into golden, blinding light. Magical in nature, certainly, for the purposes of Ellesandra's resistance. The strategy was clearly to blind Ellesandra, continuing to fight as dirty as possible, if only for a moment. The goal? The captain charged forward, arms out, to throw himself at the woman and attempt to grapple her, using his superior strength to tackle the woman to the ground and pin them under all three-hundred pounds of the dirty, muscle-bound man that he was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was dismayed that her strike into the bone of his elbow hardly fazed him at all. The first few swings were easily dodged, her haste helping her to pull away and disengage, suffering only a minor cut to her left arm that she'd barely missed dodging. She didn't push her luck fighting in again, instead dropping back with the plan of looking for another opening. It had become obvious that something was fueling this man beyond what would be considered the normal; whether this was magic or simple physical constitution Ellesandra didn't know. What she had surmised was that she did need to go for a killing blow; wearing him down over time wouldn't work. That, or simply stalling until the elves had dealt with his men, and could wittle him down from all sides. Unfortunately, with her haste spell and the fact she'd already redirected an AOE spell, that wouldn't work for her. The lethargy that would hit her when her spell ended would be more than enough to spell her death, most likely. This is normally when she would consider leading him away from others, then escaping, all while looking for an opportunity for a killing blow. It was also where the Compelled Duel discouraged it. While still possible for her to decide to lead him away, the magic worked against that thought. And thus, when he decided to make his next move, Ellesandra wasn't quite as far away from him in her stance as she normally would have been. Seeing him reach into his pocket, she'd prepared to move, backing up to create distance, and then seeing him throw something she'd covered her eyes and ducked, expecting and preparing herself to defend against another bomb. It wasn't that though; this time it was a blinding light that exploded. The thing about magic like this, was it wasn't the magic that hurt her. There was no force hitting her; there was simply light. While the light was magical in nature, it was the brightness of it that hurt her, not the light itself as if she were a vampire, so her resistance had been minimal use against it. Her saving grace was that she'd pulled back enough and prepared, covering her face, so she wasn't completely blinded, but she had definitely been dazed. Dazed enough that she hadn't been able to dodge out of the way when he suddenly appeared through the light, charging forward to grappled her. She had, however, recovered enough to make her own response to it. She raised her rapier, it glowing golden itself briefly so that it was empowered to pierce through solid stone and letting the man skewer himself if he continued just like the First mate had done, but considering how he ignored his previous wounds she hadn't stopped there. Her right hand had reached behind her, grabbing the dagger tucked beneath her armored skirt, and raising her hand up so that when he slammed into her and knocked her down, her arm wasn't stuck beneath her. The impact hurt, a lot. Her breath left her lungs and she heard a rib groan - had it cracked? - at the weight of the man pinning her body down. Her armor helped prevent any major crushing for a moment, but it wouldn't last long if he decided to start wailing on her. Her right hand had been held above though, dagger still in it, and as soon as she recovered from the brief shock and staggering her mind went through from the blow, she turned and used all the force left in her weakened right arm to slam the dagger towards the man's head; aiming for his ear or his eye, depending on how he positioned himself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The back and forth was coming to a head. Trading blows was getting neither side any significant ground, not for lack of trying on Ellesandra's part. A deadlocked fight that could go on for hours or until Ellesandra's haste ran out. Unfortunately, it seemed the fight with the elves and other pirates was similarly deadlocked. Both sides were looking worn, but the fighting continued. The chaos from the city kept up as well. All this was the backdrop for the captain toppling Ellesandra and mounting her. The captain jumped on Ellesandra's rapier, letting it skewer him through the lower chest. A punctured lung was his, certainly, as the rapier pushed straight through him and out the other side. But where the first mate had tensed and locked up at that trauma, the captain showed furtherance to his inhuman constitution as he continued as if he was entirely uninjured. He dropped his sword and moved his fat-fingered hands around Ellesandra's neck as they fell to the ground, immediately squeezing in and attempting to choke the life from the knight. Then, the dagger came. His muscly arms being directly down on Ellesandra's neck made it the easier strike to go for the ear and drive the dagger into his brain. And he hadn't the reaction time to block her. So the dagger struck true, straight into his ear, straight through into his brain. And that should have been the end of it. He should have spasmed and fell on her, gross as his blood-and-sweat-soaked, shirtless self was. He should have. But he didn't. The metal blade was jammed clean into his head. The resistance of bone was felt and passed. The dagger was in his brain. And yet...He kept squeezing, with strain showing on his face as he exerted his muscles to try and crush Ellesandra's neck. But of course, Ellesandra wasn't alone in this fight. They never were. And seeing the dire state of the knight, there was someone who was certain to throw caution to the wind and meddle. "Leave her ALONE!" came a cry from a familiar voice, one that was choking back a sob. Then, a surge of mana blossomed from the source of the voice. Intense, powerful mana. Star was standing just within Ellesandra's vision beyond the pirate captain. Ellesandra had seen Star's aura before briefly. A soft, blue glow that had a wispy, airy quality to it. Fluid like water, flowed around her like smoke. But in this moment, it was a brilliant, radiant aura that blossomed well beyond her body. The ground around Star cracked and splintered as if bolts of lightning shot out from her feet through the soft earth, leaving scars of brilliant blue out from all around her as a deafening boom of mana exploded from her. Star's eyes shone aglow with bright blue energy, wholly suffused with mana as she put all she had into this moment. She thrust her hands forward at the pirate captain, and at her mystic command, the captain was wrest away from Ellesandra in an instant, pulled up to a standing posture, arms throw to the side and head cocked to the side; a square of mana formed under him, with a diamond inside that square, and spectral, ethereal chains of mana shot up from the four corners of the square. It was a familiar sight to one familiar with the magic, the spell Hold Person, which paralyzed and trapped the pirate in place, separating from Ellesandra. Star was holding the man in place. Her power was palpable; the magic in the air crackled, free to be absorbed in its bountiful, nigh endless quantity. Blood began to drip from Star's nose as she held this; she grit her teeth and bared it, locking the pirate in place. "Kill him! End this, Ellesandra!" she cried to her companion. A request easier said than done, surely. If the dagger in his brain hadn't killed him, what hope was there in ending this man? A thought that surely might possess Ellesandra, only for the shadowy essence that the knight had felt to converge in once place upon the man. His heart. Mana was building within it, ready to burst and free the man from the spell, breaking him free to continue his campaign of carnage. But in so doing, exposed the source of his power. Ellesandra had but one moment to strike, but the answer, the true weakness of the pirate, was exposed before the knight. It required only that the knight put everything they had into one final strike.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was lucky he didn't just crush her neck, considering his potential strength. The air had already escaped her lungs from him tackling her, so it was on her attempted intake of breath afterwards that she was immediately blocked from doing so. It hadn't stopped her from stabbing him in the ear, which she had expected to cause him to freeze, loosen his hold, and then topple over or on top of her, at worst. In none of her expectations did he just ignore a damn dagger into his brain. She didn't have time to be shocked, as once she realized the attack didn't kill him she was reaching to try to pry a fingerway from her neck, just enough leverage to try to get a breath in at least, struggling with the obviously stronger opponent. Her vision had begun to blur, blackening on the edges, when she heard Star. Her head snapped to the side to look at her at the shout, then she began gasping as his hold suddenly loosened and he stood, becoming paralyzed in the process. She saw the chains wrapping around him and felt the thickness of Star's magic around her, but she didn't pull on it. How much energy had Star already expended in the healing of soldiers, and then this spell? No, but she did reach for her rapier, still in the man's lung, and ripped it out. The rapier still held the light yellow glow about it, strengthened to pierce through almost any armor or even through a wall, intended to ensure he didn't have any magical defense that would shrug it off, and her eyes focused on where she felt that shadow coalesce. Her breathing was ragged and it took a moment for her to focus her aim as well as drawing in large breaths, but with the last of her strength she stepped forward and thrust with her rapier, allowing the blade to pierce straight through his heart. She quickly released after striking, however, and stumbled back, falling on her ass with a wince at the pain that shot through her rib - okay, he had definitely cracked one of her ribs when landing on her, at least. The real reason for the stumble, though, was her haste spell ending. Between the blows she'd taken and the lack of air, her concentration on it had been slipping. She'd forced herself to hang on long enough for the last strike, but now as it was ending she felt like her muscles had just gone through a full day's worth of strenuous exercise. Her body ached and was sore all over, with large bruising marks around her neck and she was sure bruising on her right ribs beneath her armor, and she was still gasping for air - her airway finally starting to be able to take in air normally again and not just in a gasping, weak strangled way. She hoped that strike would kill him, because she didn't know if she had another left in her. And damnit, she'd never had someone keep fighting after she stabbed them in the head. What the hell was that?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The blade retreating from the man's torso saw blood pour out. The man bled, like any other. But nothing stopped him, it seemed. Until, of course, the rapier pierced through his heart. Or...Where his heart would be. For Ellesandra's blade did not find flesh at his core, but rather something hard. Not hard enough to resist the bite of the rapier, of course. Whatever hard thing was there in place of his heart cracked under the piercing force and the rapier sailed clean through. It was then, and only then, that the man showed any pain. The spell holding him in place broke, not because Star lost her grip on him, but because the moment the blade pierced him there, he died. His breath hitched, his eyes rolled back, and blood poured out of his lips. The shadowy essence fizzled, then burst, scattered away and leaving Ellesandra's senses entirely. It was gone, now. And with that strike, the pirate fell to his knees, then became coated in a black energy, and crumbled to ash soon after, leaving nothing in his wake but a pile of ash that was once the man himself, and a small, spherical gemstone amidst the pile that had a pierced hole clean through it in the shape of Ellesandra's rapier. The gem was intact despite the hole through the center; it was large enough to take this strike and not split in two, though was still only slightly larger than the circle made by a pinched thumb and index finger would make. Easily fit in the palm of one's hand. Something that cemented the man as not human at all, or at least...No longer human, once that energy imbued him. But what was more? The other pirates reacted to the death of their captain. They looked dazed. Lost. Like they had been snapped out of something. Of course, that drop in their guard was swiftly met by death blows from the other guardsman. Star then rushed to Ellesandra's side, her eyes returning to their normal pretty blue irises. She knelt beside Ellesandra, hands ready to reach out to touch Ellesandra and heal them the way only she could, but...She stopped herself. Ellesandra's words echoed in her mind. She looked at the knight, blood dripping from her nose. "...Please, Ellesandra. Let me heal you." Despite the stubbornness she had shown before...Seemed she was heeding the knight's demand that she be given permission, at least in a moment where that was an option. Tears were forming in her eyes, and her hands shook. Star was rattled, but she was unharmed. She had a lot of power at her beck and call in the moment, the only question being how exhausted Star would be in the aftermath. What price she would pay for healing the knight in this moment. And in the moments where Star awaited an answer, the chaos of the city died, replaced by a unanimous cheer of victory from below, echoed by the guardsman nearby as their weapons raised, standing victorious over the corpses of the pirate threat.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra sat on her ass, looking up at the man after he seemed to completely freeze - and then turn to ash? Ellesandra frowned, watching her dagger fall as he turned to ash, and the ash and some sort of gem settle on the ground after. "Th..the hell?" Ellesandra had defeated created and monsters before, but none that just turned to ash. They were all flesh and blood of some kind, which was why she'd felt so betrayed at how her dagger in his damn brain didn't do anything to slow him down. Her voice had come out raspy, the choked sound of a damaged wind pipe, and she blinked, turning to look at Star afterwards. Ellesandra was dazed, and a bit in shock. Her eyes turned from the remains of the creature, up to Star who seemed to hover over her and say something, then over to the pirates who had just, stopped fighting. And then they were slaughtered. She frowned, a touch of pity for them. Had they been mind controlled, or otherwise influenced somehow? If that was the case, did they need to have been cut down like that? She blinked, realizing she'd gotten distracted from Star and looked back up at Star. Her eyes turned to the shaking hands, and then up to the teary eyes. "Stop that." She ordered in a gruff, grumpy tone. Her hand came up to take Star's, squeezing it lightly in reassurance, before letting go and flicking her hands away from Ellesandra's body. "I've be-" She paused, coughing, then cleared her throat with a wince and spoke again. "been through worse. Mundane healing should..." A deep breath was taken in as she had moved to try to stand. Yep, definitely damaged a rib. Broken or fractured, she wasn't sure, but it hurt like a sonuva. "should work." They knew it didn't sound convincing, considering their stopping and the obvious pain they were in, but the important thing was it wouldn't kill her. And as long as it wouldn't kill her, and the danger was past so she didn't need to protect Star, then she could deal with the slower, mundane healing that would come with it. She did, however, hold her hand up, requesting assistance in standing up. Star pulling her up would help relieve some of the pressure from her rib when she pushed herself up. The emotions through her were mostly relief, that Star was fine and that she herself survived it, confusion and irritation that stabbing him in the brain had done nothing and at herself for getting put in that situation, and concern for the rest of the injured.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's reaction was naturally an emotional one. The contact of touching Star's hand was brief. Reassuring as it was, and brief as it was, it didn't stop a tidal wave of worry, concern, fear, and a bundle of associated emotions from pouring into Ellesandra. Something that flooded them with a magical force that overwhelmed any attempted barrier to be put up, which had the side effect of proving that the ability to separate the two was at least in part intentional on Star's part for every other time they touched. There was no holding it back this time. A momentary connection that would allow Ellesandra to know, without a shadow of a doubt, the depths of concern Star had for them. For how scared she had been, and continued to be, for the knight. As well, a healthy dose of frustration at Ellesandra's resistance to the matter. She did help them up, but the macho reassurance didn't work. She looked possibly more upset. "W-Wh...Why, Ellesandra? Please...I don't want to see you suffering, and I see the way you're flinching! There's gotta be some internal damage!" Despite her protests, she was still asking permission, rather than forcing herself on them. For now, at least. As she protested, the soldiers began to work on the post-battle actions. There were corpses to remove from the city, and discussions to be had with the local lord if they were present. As well, the black, spherical, broken gemstone was still on the ground in the pile of ash left by the late pirate captain.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The overflowing of emotions, the concern and fear for Ellesandra, hit her like a brick. She paused, the barrier between herself and Star having crumpled at the touch. It made her hesitate to take Star's hand to help stand, but she honestly needed it so she did it anyways, flinching at the overwhelming feeling of how much Star was concerned for her. "How do you even feel that much?" The question was rhetorical, not even meant for Star to hear. Star was so full of emotion, and right now it was all concern for Ellesandra and she didn't know how to handle that. Star was feeling more concern right now than Ellesandra had let herself feel anything for the year before meeting Star. Once she was standing she moved her hand to lightly support her right ribs. It was hard to do through her armor, which she'd need to remove in a bit to actually tend to her wound, but the instinctive motion to grip her side didn't matter if the armor was there. "Help me to somewhere to sit." She motioned to the encampment around the other healers, glancing again at the ashes and stopping, grumbling and moving to kick at the gem with her foot. Did she trust picking it up? She didn't sense the shadow being from it anymore, though that didn't mean it wasn't still cursed in some way, shape or form. She definitely didn't trust Star picking it up though, so taking her rapier she speared through the hole she'd already made and tilted the sword up, letting the gem fall down the sword length and just hit the hilt. Using her other hand, covered in gauntlet to prevent skin to potential magical artifact touching, she pulled it off the blade and put it in a pocket. Then, she sheathed her sword and motioned to her dagger. "And would you pick that up for me? I suspect bending over would hurt." She had ignored the question at first, but after making the requests her eyes turned to Star and watched her for a few moments. "And because I can handle the pain. I'm sure you can too, but I'm not dying, Star. I won't let you feel my pain for me anytime I'm injured just because you can. At most, depending on how bad my rib is, I'll let you use some mundane healing to force enough heal in to mend the bone if it's broken. But not the entire wound itself, and not your sympathetic healing or whatever you called it." Her voice was still raspy, but had become more steady now that she'd been getting air consistently. It would probably be raspy for the next few days while it recovered, but hopefully it wouldn't cause any longterm injury.

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star heard the question, and it was enough to sober her slightly. She was in an overwhelmed state. Her emotion was intense, but a response from Ellesandra that bordered on humour was something that gave an instinctual reminder that Ellesandra wasn't dying. The crisis had passed. The storm had quieted. Star's aura receded more, becoming only slightly more prominent than usual. One could only wonder how powerful the emotion was when it had caused her mana to overflow and create the lingering scorch marks on the dirt; a blackened circle with lightning-like arms stretching in all directions remained where she had been standing. A testament to Star's potential, though even if Star had showcased unique powers thus far, unique did not necessarily equate to powerful. The moment she had intervened and saved Ellesandra from the captain, however? That had been power enough to face the entire army of pirate, surely. Yet, it had not been harnessed. All things that the knight might consider when a broken rib wasn't a far more pressing concern. Star observed the gem, but she was too focused on her companion to really ask questions about it. She bent over to take the dagger as requested and handed it to Ellesandra before supporting them by wrapping her arm around the shorter woman's back, mindful to not hold too tight and put pressure on their chest. She looked disappointed and worried to hear that the knight didn't permit her to take the injuries herself, placated only by the notion that they would permit her to mend the bone, at least. "It is broken," she asserted as fact. "It needs attention, or it may not set correctly and impede your ability to fight. We should be trying to return you to your prime and see if we can restore the strength in your right arm, not giving you another lasting injury to slow you down." She refrained from making a pointed remark about Ellesandra's ego, here. Why did all the proud fighters have to wear wounds like badges of honour? "Part of protecting me is ensuring you are keeping yourself in peak fighting condition, wouldn't you agree?" she said as they reached the secured clearing, so she could ease Ellesandra down on a wooden log that had been conjured to sit on like a bench. There were padded bedrolls laid out to rest on if Ellesandra preferred to lay down. Star had seemed to calm herself at this point; the contact steadily became more separated until the barrier between emotions solidified once more. Star was still dripping blood from her nose, though that too had slowed. Her frame was still slightly shaking, but that too had been subsiding. She looked at the other healers doing their work. There were still more injured, and the last trickle of wounded were arriving from the fight in the city. Star looked like she was going to call some of the others over to heal Ellesandra, but...A mental calculation dissuaded her from doing so. Perhaps she thought their skills were better used on their own, given how much more it would take to tend to the knight. Regardless, she placed a hand on Ellesandra's neck. Her hand then shone aglow with white light, and she showed strain in her face as healing energies poured into Ellesandra. Her hand trembled, but she forced through this. Two minutes of concentration later, and her hand eventually fell off Ellesandra's neck, with sweat pooled on her brow. Exhaustion was more than obvious; this effort had renewed the bleeding from her nose to a steady drip. But for her efforts, the magic had forced itself through Ellesandra's wards enough to set the bone in their ribs and mend it. It was still tender; the surrounding muscle was beyond her capacity in the moment to heal, so bruising and some small internal bleeding was left untreated. The other cuts were also left without treatment, and Star was plainly beyond tapped out, pushing into reserves even greater than her last exertion with her shimmering armor. She'd done enough to ensure no lasting damage was done, and this time it seemed it wouldn't take Ellesandra admonishing her to get her to stop. She hit a limit that certainly wouldn't cause any lasting harm, but...Despite her unfaltering spirit, she had hit the limit of what her body could safely take. Exhausted, she sat on the log beside Ellesandra, chest slightly heaving. Eyes shut. Sweating and hot on the forehead. Bloody nose slowly clotting. She was a mess. And yet...She smiled. It hadn't been a victory without cost. But it was, still, victory. Evil had lost on this day, and Lissana might yet breathe a heavy sigh of relief when the news reached them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't come around enough to notice the black marks, not until they had started walking by them. She had taken the knife and slid it back into it's sheath beneath her armored skirt, right up against her leggings. She was bleeding from a spot in her thigh and arm, as well as the bruising around her throat and likely on her rib. Now that the adrenaline had mostly gone, she was feeling the pain and winced a bit more at it. The touch from Star, to help her along, was almost refused - not because she didn't need the help, but because touching Star was overwhelming right now. Even with her barrier the concern was pouring through, at least at that moment, and she didn't like how much of it she felt. As they passed by the scarred land, Ellesandra looked down at it in surprise, but didn't comment on it. She also glanced over to the soldiers, to confirm they hadn't been completely wiped out and were at least faring better than maybe she was. Still, she hdidn't say anything until she was brought into the healer's tent and to a makeshift bench, sitting down with a sigh of relief, leaning her head back and pressing back into the bench with one hand on her side. She needed to get her armor off soon, so it wasn't bothering the wound. Only after the danger was confirmed over, though. "How do you know it's broken?" She asked, in regards to Star asserting it. Oh, it probably was. With the way it hurt, she was just lucky she didn't feel in pain in her lung or trouble breathing, meaning the broken bone hadn't gone into her lung. Her armor had really done wonders in helping take some of that man's heavy form. "I'm not saying you're not allowed to heal, just the bare minimum, Star." Just enough that it could heal properly on it's own. The rest could be mended with mundane means, without Star exhausting herself or taking the pain on herself. Feeling Star place a hand on her neck made her jerk, surprised at it's placement. She wasn't about to heal the throat injury, was she? But no, Ellesandra felt the magic attempting to flow to her rib. She had to actively force her body not to try to absorb the magic, like it naturally wanted to do. She could ensure that she didn't absorb it, though that didn't make it any easier to actually cast into. Her innate resistance was still a thing, and Star would feel like she was trying to shove her magic through a thick, muddy sludge of a body. Ellesandra hadn't been paying attention to Star, which was her bad, because when Star stopped she was obviously exhausted. Ellesandra was breathing better and the pain was definitely lessened, but Star had obviously pushed herself too far. Reaching over, she lightly wiped at the bloody nose to wipe some of the blood off of Star's face, frowning at her. "You went too far." A protest that was useless, since it had already been done. She sighed, leaning back in the chair and looking around at the other healers. She'd recover for a moment before seeing about wrapping her other, more mundane injuries. "I don't think I'm going to be carrying you back this time."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Says the woman who had a broken rib," said Star back, wearing a smile despite the obvious exhaustion in her voice. She looked up at the knight, her eyelids heavy. "...I mean it, though. Me being the sort who is often in the backline, often out of danger...What gives me any right to work any less hard than the people putting everything on the line?" she asked, perhaps rhetorically. She looked out over the other healers. "...I might feel like hell for the next day or two. But I'm still breathing. That's more than I can say for some of the fighters who came here today to do what needed to be done. Don't mistake my words for suggesting I want to take their place, but...There are going to be friends and family who will endure incredible pain when we all return, and their worst fears become reality to know that this morning was the last time they saw their friend or loved one alive." She paused. "...I have no right returning to the company of such people unless I've given every last drop of my strength in the fight. For no matter how much I sacrificed today, they certainly sacrificed more. I will recover. There are some who came today who will not." She again went quiet for a time. She drew in a heavy breath, then lowered her head. "...I always know what other people feel, remember, Ellesandra? It can take time to focus on it but...Your aura knows all that ails you, physically, and emotionally. A touch is all it takes, though...The connection is almost never as automatic as it is with you. I have to...Actively try to separate us, where with most I have to actively try to form that bridge."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She rolled her eyes about the broken rib. It wasn't like she intentionally broke her rib. What choice did she have, let the captain just sweep through the elven guard? Hell, she would have died if it weren't for Star. That feeling settled uneasily in her gut, remembering the man hovering over her with his hands on her neck, knife in his head and not stopping. The surprise she'd felt at that moment when he just...kept going. Fucking hell, it had been a long time since she'd felt fear like that. not since - The flash of emotional pain made her wince and reach down, pressing her thumb against her thigh wound to send a spike of physical pain through her own body. It quickly refocused her thoughts away from where they were and she cursed under her breath, as if she hadn't expected the pain even though she'd done it intentionally. Taking a deep breath she leaned her head back and stared up, at either the sky or the enclosed vines. "It isn't your fault, those others who died. And it's not because you gave any less than they did. So stop that shit, or self-blaming. It isn't healthy." Kettle, meet pot. She knew this in the back of her mind, but didn't comment on it. She also pushed her guards down just a little harder at the idea that Star had to fight to prevent the bridge between them, rather than working to form it with other people. That idea bothered her; if anything, she would very much have liked the choice on whether or not to let Star into her emotions. She didn't currently have that, and the vulnerability of it bothered her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I'm not blaming myself," she snapped back, exhausted as she was. "I'm saying I hold myself to the same standard. That if they are willing to die, I'm not content until I've run myself ragged trying to keep them alive. When I face the grieving faces of those who must face the ultimate loss, I need to be able to genuinely tell them I did all I could." Another pause for breath. "...I certainly saved at least a few lives here today. And that's about the only thing that can keep me from actually blaming myself for the ones I couldn't. I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to fight as hard as you do, Ellesandra. That's...All I've been trying to say every time I've begged you to let me help you. But since we're on the topic of telling each other to stop unhealthy habits, I'd be remiss to not mention you jamming your thumb into your womb to repress what you were feeling just then. I'm...Doing my best to respect your privacy on the matter, but I don't know how much self-destruction you expect me to be okay with."  
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra blinked in surprise when Star snapped back at her. Perhaps she had misinterpreted, then. There was no offense taken at the snap, more just surprised the usually polite and kind woman had it in her. A brief reminder to herself they'd known eachother for just a couple of days; plenty to still learn if they wanted to. Ellesandra wasn't sure how much more she wanted to, since Star had already learned more about her than she was comfortable with. Still, she listened to the rest, watching Star silently, until she turned the topic back on her. Ellesandra turned her gaze away, jaw clenching, and a mixture of defensive anger and discomfort rose. She had to fight the anger down not to snap at Star herself; she'd already done that last night, and look how that had turned out. Instead, there was silence for a moment before she pressed her left palm down into the bench and pushed herself up with it, standing with a wince. The rib definitely felt better, but it wasn't like the pain was all gone. Not only that, but the thigh and arm didn't feel great either. She didn't go far, ignoring anything Star said until she located some of the mundane supplies for wounds and brought them back to the bench. She sat, and without a word slid her leggings down enough to begin tending to the new injury on her thigh, like she had the other day. Her lips were pressed together and, while she wasn't really trying to give Star the silent treatment as a punishment per-say, she wanted to make it clear that line of conversation was not open, and pushing at it would just make Ellesandra withdraw - because she would. She had agreed to guard Star; that was all. She had not agreed to be her friend, even if that's how their relationship was going so far. The silence was also a good time to push down that defensive anger, and the bit of shame that was buried deep within it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star watched the other woman silently get up and busy themselves. Star had things she felt strongly about just the same as Ellesandra. A standard to which she held herself. A duty to other people. An overwhelming need to embrace altruism and reject selfish desires within herself. She wasn't physically strong like Ellesandra. And to date she hadn't shown particular prowess at any offensive magic either. Being able to paralyze an opponent certainly was potent, but only assuming there was someone who could deliver the lethal blow waiting nearby. She couldn't guard people like Ellesandra could. So she had to do other things to look out for people around her. It hurt her to see Ellesandra turn silent on her. It hurt her more for that to be triggered by hypocrisy. It already took a mountain (that didn't exist) of patience to not throw herself at Ellesandra and SCREAM at them to stop pushing everything down. But...Star was, if nothing else, patient. Even on the verge of passing out from her exhaustion, she held patience. She took Ellesandra's lead about silence, then took some of the medical supplies for herself. Not to apply to herself, but to tend to other wounds she could see on the knight. Just because they were giving her the silent treatment didn't mean she was going to stop caring about them and their health. It would take a lot more than a stubborn pout to turn off Star's altruistic nature.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra jumped when she felt Star reach for her arm. A glance to the side made it obvious Star was reaching to help tend to the wound, and she sighed. "You're too damn good, Star. Be a bitch back sometimes, it would help." She gave Star a wry smile, before holding her arm out in an angle that helped Star to access the shrapnel wound just above her elbow. She'd been lucky it hadn't hit right in the elbow, because unlike the damn captain who just kept swinging after being struck there, it would have more severely impacted Ellesandra. Would she have been able to bring the dagger into his head if she'd been hit there? Probably not, not that it really mattered anyways. Another wince came, though this time just from the general ache and muscle fatigue that came from her using the haste spell to it's full duration. She could rest for hours, if she let herself. Would the camp rest here, to take care of their wounded? A glance was given around to see what the plan was. "What's the plan for getting back? Or are we going back, or leaving from here to our next destination?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I'll just feel worse if I'm mean to you," she said, offering a sincere smile at Ellesandra. It was true. A little misunderstanding was all it took to make Star bawl her eyes out. "If you need more motivation to ease up, I can always work on my puppy-dog eyes," she added, being as gently playful as she could be with her words given her state. Though the notion of Star somehow looking even more like a kicked puppy when receiving harsh words was a scary one. It already took so little to get her misty-eyed when it was someone she cared about. She worked on what wounds she could, demonstrating a clear skill with medicine, though her motions were slowed considerably by her exhaustion. She was liable to pass out once the adrenaline waned. She already looked a little unsteady now and again. "I'm sure Morrun and Lissana would accept us if we need to go back. But I think the decision is one we should make together. You were the one who demanded I take an extra day and rest...I'll probably need two or three days to get back to full strength after today. But hells if I'll be able to march back there. I'd sooner find an inn in Cloverport to pass out in than even think about marching that distance again. Hell, this log is looking pretty comfy right about now, even. Just hold still until I'm done dressing your wounds, if nothing else."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra just imagined Star giving her puppy eyes and was immediately effected by just the imagination. "Do not ever do that." She said in a serious tone that was much more fear that Star would do it and she'd bend immediately than in actual seriousness about her doing it. She finished bandaging her own thigh, delayed a bit by using only one hand while Star bandaged in her right arm, and then watched as Star finished up her arm. She used her left hand to reposition her leggings back in place, settling back in on the bench and sighing again. "I agree, that march back to the elven settlement would be too much for today. Need to find somewhere to rest now, but I'm not sure an inn in Cloverport will be the best, do you? If there are people who remember us and blame us for the attack at all, or the damage or death caused by it, it might be bad for us in our weakened states. Perhaps you can rest on the bench for a bit while I ask the elven commander what their plan is, and decide from there?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept up until all of Ellesandra's wounds were dressed. Her work was good, even in this state. She knew her way around properly cleaning and dressing a wound. Thankfully none were deep enough to require stitching. Her hands were too shaky to hold a needle still at the moment. She nodded to the plan, though couldn't help a lingering smile at the idea that she could sway Ellesandra with puppy dog eyes. She'd never do so maliciously. She couldn't. But if it was all in good fun, she was perhaps even more inclined to try it, given Ellesandra's response. A little secret for her to keep, though the smile on her face was at least a little bit telling to her inner mischief maker. But, serious topics once more: "Mn, that sounds like a good plan. I'm sure most of the soldiers feel the same, and not just forced march but carrying the wounded I'm sure isn't high on everyone's priorities. Still...I have to wonder. I noticed how the pirates reacted to the captain dying. I have to wonder if there was some magic at play, something that affected the townspeople as well."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited until Star had finished entirely bandaging her, and then moved to stand again. She grit her teeth at the ache in her muscles; yep, she definitely needed some rest. "I don't know, there was the gem that fell out of the captain but...I don't want to bother investigating it until we're both well rested. It's entirely possible it's cursed in some way and I don't want to deal with that in our fatigued state." She looked around, trying to find the rear guard commander. "You lay down and rest. When I have a plan of where we can stay, I'll come get you." She also hoped that she would be able to wake Star, because in her current state she wasn't confident she could lift and carry the mage. As small as Star might be, Ellesandra was weaker than ever right now, and with her right arm being out of commission for lifting things she'd be hard pressed to just fireman carry Star anyways. The mention of Star healing that arm came back to her and she pursed her lips, not liking the idea even if Star had a point. "Will you be okay while I go do that?" She wanted to ask before leaving, and asking also got her mind off of the discomfort with the idea that came up.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft nod. "I've made friends with the healers, I'm sure they'll smack anyone who tries to bother me," she said with a smile. That she made friends was hardly a surprise. She moved to lay on the log and looked to be quite swift in falling into a light sleep. Talking to the captain would reveal the plan was to make camp among the trees when spoken to, and that Ellesandra and Star were more than welcome to join them, that a tent, a fire, and provisions were plentiful, and plans were already being made for a rotating watch to guard the camp. A safe place to rest for the night was theirs, and with Ellesandra bringing the topic up had the captain starting to bark orders at soldiers to begin the preparations for the camp. Bedrolls and communal tents were planned, though the travel food would prove to leave a little to be desired. Military rations were meant to last, not be tasty, after all.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, glancing at said healers at the mention. Now that she was standing her legs were screaming at her. It wasn't pain, per say, but just the absolute fatigue that came with pushing your muscles too far. Taking a deep breath, she confirmed that Star was laying down and alright before she headed off to the commander to inquire about the camp's plans. With confirmation they would be setting up camp nearby, Ellesandra began making her way back to the healer's tent and locating her bag, which she'd placed down after they'd set up camp. The tent was folded up within it, but as she stared at it she realized she really did not have the energy right now to set it up. Instead, she looked over to the healers, and deciding their tent was good enough, she just moved to lay down her bedroll next to the bend Star was laying on. A spare blanket, small but still a fur blanket, was placed over Star's resting form, trying not to wake her. If the healers needed them to move, they'd tell them. Until then, Ellesandra needed just as much rest as Star probably did, and would lay down next to the bench she was sleeping to get it. Food could come later, once her muscles weren't screaming in fatigue.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The healers were naturally the ones in charge of comfort for everyone. So, one came over with a less fatigued soldier and directed Ellesandra to one of the tents that was set up with bedrolls, and had the other soldier carry Star along to something more comfy than a log. Thanks were given to both of them for their efforts along with a deep bow from the healer, allowing the two to rest through the night. Food could come in the morning, more than likely, as fatigue remained the most pressing issue. A communal effort was made to ensure everyone was taken care of, with the remainder of the night being just idle tasks before everyone went to bed. The elves did not sleep; they engaged in reverie, often called 'trance', for just four hours. But Star and Ellesandra would likely need a full eight, perhaps ten or twelve before they were able to wake again. But during the night, Ellesandra was visited again. The scenery was different this time. They were on the pirate ship's deck this time, out in the middle of the ocean. Water in all directions, moonlight sky above, sails fully deployed and riding the wind across the black waves. No other beings on the deck of the ship. Just Ellesandra, and the shadowy black creature. They had no eyes, yet Ellesandra somehow knew the creature was looking at them. They were about ten feet apart. Ellesandra had their rapier and armor, and didn't feel any of the injuries of their waking self. They were lucid, aware of their dream. The shadow figure did not exude malice or a desire to fight, but there was certainly also a sense that fighting this creature was a bad idea, at least in this dreamscape where they seemed to hold all the power. "...Why, Ellesandra?" asked the voice which continued to deny any understanding about its nature. "Why did you not run?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected that offer. When laying down and the healer offering them to go to the tent, Ellesandra looked at Star in concern. That was quickly answered as one of the other elves moved to carry Star. She felt concern for Star for a moment until she saw Star laid down in the bedroll safe, and then moved to lay nearby. She positioned herself so that she'd be between Star and anyone that would be approaching; not that it would matter, with how deep into sleep she fell. Normally Ellesandra had trained herself to sleep lightly, to wake up at any strange noises and such, but when she was this exhausted and her body so weak after the haste spell, she always slept deeply. It was one reason she hadn't felt entirely comfortable with sleeping in the inn, compared to with the elves. The elves, she at least was allied with and kind of trusted to keep an eye out. Random people in an Inn who might hold a grudge, whether or not they were magicked? Definitely not. When she dreamt again, of the shadowy black creature, Ellesandra immediately reached for her weapon. Even if it wasn't looking hostile, it had been hostile - and Ellesandra was taking up a defensive posture. "Why are you still in my dreams? Is it the gem?" She had worried that the creature might be in the gem. Had sleeping with it in her pocket been a mistake? Either way, she didn't answer it's question. Instead she stayed in the defensive, concern and caution filling her emotions, eyes flicking this way and that to see if anything else was around.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The dreamscape was still just a ship. No other persons. No threats. Not even any waves to speak of. The waters were unnaturally still as the ship sailed through them. The shadowy figure did not react to the defensive posture. "The gem lost its influence when you shattered it. But it also a...Lesser gem," the shadow explained, strangely helpful. "It poses you no harm, now. Though perhaps some magic lingers within it to be discovered. Now I ask, again...Why did you not run? I have shown you that the only thing that awaits you is pain."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was a little surprised at how the shadow just...answered her. A frown creased her face and her right hand reached for her pocket, where the gem had been. Magic still in it? It would need to be examined by someone with more skill in identifying that type of thing; she didn't trust it otherwise. She definitely wasn't just going to take this shadow's word for it. "I'm not going to play your games or answer your questions just because you show up in my dream. After what I saw you encouraging be done with those pirates and in that town, I've no requirement to answer anything." Stubborn she was, not always the most intelligent though.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "If I wanted to force you to answer, force you to bend to me, I would have little trouble. I would think you'd consider not joining the fate of that pirate captain you slayed a mercy. Not that I expect you to take my mercy as a signal that I am your ally. But that I am not your ally does not necessarily mean I am your enemy. I hope at least you can recognize that drawing your blade has no purpose here." With those words, Ellesandra's rapier drew itself and flung across the ship, embedding in the deck far behind the shadow. It then exploded into flowers. This was, after all, a dream. Just not one that Ellesadnra was in control of. "I'm not here to play games. I'm here to talk. But if you'd rather be stubborn and resist, there's no reason I need be civil. The choice is yours, Ellesandra."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra reached for her rapier even as it shot across the ship and into the deck, then turned into....flowers? She blinked a few times in confusion before turning to look back at the shadow. Well, if it was trying to show it had control here, it did. She considered trying to pinch herself to force herself to wake up, but not only did she doubt that would work, it seemed childish. Instead, she took a step back, creating more distance between her and the creature, then crossed her arms tightly. "Fine. We trade questions then. I ask first, then you. Why are you haunting, or visiting or whatever you would call this, Star's guardians?" Obviously there was nothing forcing the creature to answer, but she was hoping that it would accept the back and forth rather than just asking Ellesandra a bunch of questions. It would put them on as close to even ground as Ellesandra might be able to wrangle in this space.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"I certainly wouldn't call it haunting, but you can call it whatever you like. And it is not just Star. But she is certainly one of the persons of interest, yes. The reason for it? Well. It is quite a story to explain in full. The overwhelming majority of it does not concern you. But the part that does? I hope you won't consider the answer insufficient as I tell you that it is...Not as much about Star herself as it is what Star is trying to do. If she, like you, were to abandon the cause and leave, then you would never see me again. I have little hope that you, or I, would ever dissuade her from abandoning her cause. I have succeeded in manufacturing the circumstances to ensure Nina is no longer acting in protection of Star. And you'll forgive me for hoping that my previous entry into your dream, showing you what awaits Star, and showing you that I am all too aware of your past with Marigold, along with the leverage that provides me, would have been enough to make you act rationally, and leave. She will pursue her goal without you, but she will not be able to achieve it alone. She might even live to an old age." The shadow then paused to allow them to take in the information. "So again...I ask...Why did you not run?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched the creature, considering. Was it...trying to protect Star? Though it's mention of Marigold sent anger through her, not only at the memory of the previous dream but also at the irritation and pain that the memory brought. And that not only star, but this damn creature could just apparently see right through her. She was tired of not having her normal barriers work. Shifting to let out some of the irritated energy, she shook her head. "Rationally? You pretend you know anything about Marigold, to have her name in your mouth. If you did, you would have known that showing her dying to me, and implying the same would happen if Star continued alone, would only encourage me to stay with her and protect her from that fate." The words were not verbalized, but in her mind she heard them. 'like I couldn't protect Marigold'. She wanted to do it right, this time. She could not let another charge die. If she walked away now, and Star died on her journey, Ellesandra would be at fault - or at least, she would feel like she was at fault.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Really? Because the way I see it, you've done nothing but agonize over your failure. Nothing but insult and push away everyone around you. I saw fit only to give you a gentle shove over the edge and have you see the truth. The pirate captain you faced was a peon. The thralls that serve me could run you through in an instant, ending your life before you ever realized you were under threat. And I say that not as a threat. I say that simply to illustrate to you that the path you walk is one that spells your doom. I would truly prefer that you and Star do live. I mean that. But you meddle in things beyond the scope of your existence. You walk forward to mutual peril. You have encountered me only by chance, and you owe nothing to Star. You won't be able to save her from me if you press onwards to Myst, and then her homeland. While Myst will be a safe place for you, the lands beyond will not be. Gurhal will be your grave." The shadow paused again, once more giving information away. "You are welcome to ask another question, if you are prepared to answer another in turn."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Lips pressed together in a firm line, displeased with what he was saying. It wasn't entirely inaccurate, though she didn't go out of her way to insult people like he implied. Push them away surely, but she mostly did that by just being guarded. Unfortunately, that didn't seem to work with Star. At the promise of how dangerous continuing this path was, she just shook her head. "Again, all you're doing is assuring me that either I stay with Star and convince her not to follow this path, or stay with her to protect her from this mutual peril that we'd both be in. Not doing a good job of convincing me otherwise." She relaxed her crossed arms, only to reach up and scratch at the back of her head when considering another question. Did she have another one, that was worth answering one of its? The creature seemed to be pretty powerful, and already knew about Marigold, so what did she have to hide. "Beyond convincing Star not to follow this path - because we both know that's about as likely as myself becoming as emotional as Star and sharing them with the world - How can I best protect her from you and these perils she faces?" Might as well get straight to the heart of the matter, right? No need to beat around the bush.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"There's no reason to kill Star if she has no guardian to get in the way. Conflict will keep her away, and she will find it at very corner where she walks without you. She will run, perhaps forever, while being infinitely redirected by me. I can't guarantee she will survive, but I can promise I won't be the one to fell her if you leave," said the creature, difficult to determine if it was indifference or some other thing in its warbled tone. The emotion was impossible to discern. "As to your question? You can best protect her by leaving. But to ensure I stay true to the spirit of your question, I will provide another answer." Was the figure lying, or just trying to dissuade Ellesandra further? Could they trust the figure? It was giving a warning where it at least claimed it could end them in an instant, but was holding back. Was that also a bluff? If something stronger than the pirate was sent to Ellesandra and was equally able to take knives to its brain, perhaps it wasn't. But it had made its desires clear. It had every reason to try and get Ellesandra to leave, and little reason to encourage them to stay. "You will not defeat my thralls in combat. You are too mortal. Strong as you are, you are too weak. You have lived but twenty four years. Barely cresting adulthood. My greater thralls, the bearer of the Blood Onyx, the Red Opal, the Blood Emerald." As they spoke, the thralls in question appeared behind them. They each looked at Ellesandra with indifference, though their forms were shadow, like the primary shadow. Each one had a gemstone embedded in their heart, like the captain had. An onyx, an opal, and an emerald, each one tinted red and dripping with blood. Unlike the main shadow, they each had a set of eyes. The first two red, 'emerald' one green eyes. The eyes were solid colours and glowing. "You will not defeat them in battle. And since that is all you know, you will be powerless against them. And if it comes to it, they will take Star by force. Before I ask my question...Does that sufficiently answer yours?"
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked between each of the creatures that the shadow was 'showing' her, trying to take in any details about them she could. Obviously there was very little information, but even just a generic outline might help her recognize one of them in the wild before they started attacking, assuming she couldn't identify the feeling of the shadow ahead of time. It was odd that she'd been able to feel it from the boat, but she didn't want to ask about that or give that information away, unsure if it knew that she could sense it. "Lovely to know your absolute confidence, thank you for that." They weren't going to pretend the 'leaving Star' wasn't a consideration, but it was one she could consider when she was awake, not when she was conversing with this shadow being for now. "If I were a technical person, your question was just asked by confirming it sufficiently answered mine. But I'll play fair and honorable, as Torm would have me do. Yes, that sufficiently answers my question."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You'll find that playing games with me will end poorly for you all the same," said the shadow, still once more with emotions unable to be discerned. "Very well. Then my next question is thus: Why do you believe Star is connected to you? Auramancers have supreme control over their auras. Or at least...A master auramancer does. It should not be that touch alone bridges the connection between you both. Or is it not that you do not think about it, simply that you do not care to consider it? That her ability to see through your careful stoic face bothers you too much to bother with such idle curiosities?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned. So this being obviously knew Star was an auramancer, which was apparently something most people didn't know about. Was it a deity of some kind? Or perhaps just a really powerful demon? She wouldn't be surprised if it was just a deity fucking around in mortal's lives, and huffed silently. "I have no idea why, she mentioned that and it bothers the hell out of me. I'd rather her not be able to see shit. I'm not aware of any connection between the two of us, beyond maybe you appearing in my damn dreams." She paused, tilting her head one way then the other. She never fully looked away from the shadow, keeping it in her sight, but she did look to the side while considering. "Perhaps when she first used magic when I first approached her, and I absorbed some of her energy through my own ability, that bridged it? Because I have some of her energy in me, her auramancy reads it like she's reaching out to something similar, or acts as the bridge for her?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The shadow didn't react to the answer given. "A worthy theory. But her auramantic magic bypasses your absorption. Her more typical mana, that she can use to cast spells more familiar to the typical caster, you have absorbed. But it connects her to you no more or less than it has connected you to every other source of mana that you have absorbed." The shadow then paused. "I remain honourable in my methods. So I will further extend the spirit of the question and ask: Do you wish to knew the truth of this matter? And if so, do you wish for me to explain it, or do you wish to ask Star, knowing she might not know, or might lie? Though I suppose...If you do not leave Star, you will be seeing me again, and may wish to explore one option before the other."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	"What is the purpose of sending me to ask Star only to expect me to ask you again afterwards? If you know the answer and are willing to share, why not just share it rather than ask these silly questions? I care not where the answer comes from, other than knowing I distrust you more than I distrust Star." Which was actually saying something, since while she trusted Star to speak the truth most of the time, she did not trust how her magic worked. It was less about trust in Star and more a dislike to how vulnerable and open she felt against her magic, how she had no control over a firm emotional boundary that she usually drew for everyone to stay away from.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You'll find that I don't ask needless questions. Even if you might not understand the reason initially, it has its purpose. In this case, consider that the answer I have to share may have its consequence. That learning this from me may deprive you of the chance to ask Star instead. You say you care not where the answer comes from, but perhaps you should consider if that is wise. I am not your ally. My words may sow doubt in you. I have proven that I know things most do not. That I know at all what Auramancy is alone proves as much. Yet I know so much more. Things I should not know, in the opinions of many. So it then becomes a question you must ask yourself: Where is your anchor? Unto which pillars of truth do you sow your foundations? Plausibility? Contextual validity? Faith in the source? I present to you the problem you now face, since you are so eager to rush forward without due consideration of it: You may ask Star, and Star alone. I will tell you that Star knows not the full answer. Only the surface of the truth. She will tell you the root cause. She will tell you what her mother told her. She will tell you, perhaps even show you, what causes the two of you specifically to be connected in that way. She may even be able to tell you how rare it is that this phenomenon occurs with others. What she cannot tell you, what she does not know, is why you and her now stand together. And that, Ellesandra...Will prove to be unpalatable knowledge for you, I believe. Knowledge I am happy to provide...For I believe there is a chance it will further my ends, and give you greater cause to depart from Star, and abandon her mission. Knowledge I can assure you is the truth, regardless of how vehemently you choose to doubt it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shook her head. "If the answer is true, then I care not it's source in this moment. Should the answer be something I feel Star should have told me, then that's a conversation I will have with her. Assuming I believe you and you aren't phrasing things in a way to intentionally antagonize me against her, which I'll decide if you are after I heart this. So, stop talking in riddles and answer it." Ellesandra seemed a little impatient and annoyed with the shadow. She didn't like how this creature could apparently just appear in her dreams at will, how much power it might have and that it seemed intent on stopping Star from finishing her mission. Her arms crossed again, glancing around as if seeking a way to escape this conversation or dream. Maybe pinching herself wasn't such a bad idea, after all? Would that wake her though, or just reinforce that this was a dream? She wasn't sure; dream magic was something she wasn't aware of, if this even was dream magic.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "They are hardly riddles, Ellesandra. You are still young, still cresting over your passage into adulthood. One day, you will need to face the reality of the grand multiverse around you, and your place in it. Or don't. You're welcome to remain ignorant. But as for the answer...You and Star have what auramancers call 'resonance'. Auras are a strange and mysterious thing, and there are many points where words will fail to adequately explain them. This is one such time, but...Simply think of it like music. Two harmonies that compliment one another perfectly and sound...Right. Auramancers slowly come to achieve resonance with other people over time, if they remain close, and the bond between them grows strong enough. Though, I speak of this as if there are thousands of auramancers from which to draw such conclusions. No. Their bloodline has been ongoing for but a few short centuries, and what other bloodlines of auramancers I have known have all died. But I digress. This resonance is rare to exist naturally. Extremely so. Perhaps it is just chance, perhaps there is some other quality that creates it. I truly cannot say." A first for the shadow, it seemed. "But the resonance of your auras is something that would typically require a very....Specific emotion to achieve. And even then, it is not guaranteed. That is why Star struggles to control her powers in how they affect you. That she could see your emotions would always be true, but what happens when you touch is where this resonance matters. Which leads me to...The part that Star does not know. The why of it all. The truth of why you were on the road you were on at the exact moment you needed to be. Perhaps you just through it a coincidence. But I'm sure my talking about it clues you into how it was anything but." The shadow stopped here, raising an arm towards Ellesandra. A shimmering light appeared beside Ellesandra. Another figure, this one a coalescence of white light taking the form of a humanoid. Around this figure's neck appeared to be hanging a necklace, with a brilliant sapphire pendant. The necklace was ethereal and made of light as well, so it would take some time to study it to discern that it was supposed to be jewelry, and different from the embedded gemstones of the other shadows behind the one who spoke. "...It was my enemy who guided the circumstances. Who meddled in precisely every necessary event to ensure that you and Star crossed paths and met one another under circumstance that would compel your response. Manipulated you into meeting her, with both of you remaining none the wiser to it, so that all would fall into place, and disrupt my ends. And you have said yourself more than once how you do detest the gods and their meddlesome ways...Even if this white figure beside you, nor I, are gods. Had it not been for this influence, you very well might never had met Star. And thus, never would have been caught up in the war they and I fight. So it is my desire only to persuade you to walk away from this manipulation, return the world to its fated ways."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was getting tired of this creature's way of speaking. It was arrogant and seemed to like to hear itself talk, considering how it kept going on and on without getting to the point. The point being, apparently this other creature with a sapphire pendant was the one who brought them together. This shadow creature's enemy? They looked towards this figure, looking them up and down to take in as much detail about them as possible so if it was anything like how the creature actually looked, they would be able to recognize them upon encountering them. Then, turned back to the shadow and shrugged. "Oh lovely some fate designed connection between Star and I that lets her see into me. That isn't her fault, and damn well isn't mine, as much as I hate her being able to see my emotions so easily." She shook her head. "And why would knowing this strange creature orchestrated us together make me less inclined to continue on my path? You're doing the exact same thing, trying to manipulate me into not continuing. Either I continue and do what this other creature wants, or don't and do what you want. Either way, I'm following the plan of some other asshole. Might as well do what I want and say fuck you to anyone else who might benefit or not from it. Right now, my decisions are my own. Now, if I jump over the side of this ship, will the damn dream end?" She was done talking to this creature. Her head hurt - as much as it could hurt in a dream - and she didn't give a damn about what it was saying.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You're welcome to view it as such. But consider that one side manipulated you without your knowledge, and I brought forward my intentions honestly. I am stating my intentions, and providing you forewarning of the consequences of your actions. I relegate the freedom to choose to you in turn." The shadow paused a moment. "The dream will not end if you jump. The dream will end when I permit it. Which I will permit promptly once I offer you one last chance to ask a final question of me if you so wish. It will be a few days before you see me again, I imagine. But time will tell."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waved her hand. "No question, just get me out of here. Your verbose way of speaking is reminding me of the nobility back home and it's giving me a headache." She'd always hated being in meetings with Marigold where she had to listen to the nobles speak down their noses at every little thing, but speak around issues consistently so as to not draw any unwanted or negative attention to themselves. She had frequently just wanted to knock them in the back of the head and tell them to speak normally and tell it to someone straight, but they wouldn't of course and she would never do that. The only one of them that ever spoke to her straight was Marigold, though growing up together certainly helped that. Marigold had learned early in childhood that Ellesandra might tease her for something, but would never hold it against her or over her head. Children made mistakes, and Ellesandra was a ride-or-die friend in keeping those mistakes secret. She looked back at the creature, impatient and waiting. Would she wake from her dream immediately after, or would she still be able to sleep normally? She hoped she didn't wake up screaming or go into a nightmare after this; the creature probably had the power to force that and it would just be plain annoying to do when surrounded by elves and Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Upon the question being passed, the ship faded away to blackness. Their regular dreams were not theirs to have this night; Ellesandra woke, and it was later into morning. They were rested, though the wounds from the night before were certainly still there. Star was still asleep beside Ellesandra. Peaceful, and calm. The gentle sounds of elves moving about outside the tent to tend to morning needs could be heard. It was a calm morning. The dangers of the night prior were gone, now.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra set up quickly, Groaning at the pain that shot through her ribs, she did a quick link glance around to ensure that the shadow wasn't anywhere to be seen, and that they were in the camp as they were when they went to bed. Star was still next to her, and the bustle of the camp in the morning seemed normal. Her muscles still screamed in protest at her movements, still in a state where she would she would need rest to be back to 100% not even considering injuries, but she wasn't going to fall over from fatigue at least. For a moment, she watched Star sleeping to ensure she wasn't having a similarly bad dream. With a grunt, she pushed off of the ground and stood up, stretching and popping multiple bones along the way. Her entire body was still sore, but pain was mostly focused to her rib and thigh. Her arm was a minor ache, where apparently the shrapnel hadn't gone in enough to be a major wound. With her stomach growling loudly, she made her way over to wherever they were serving food. She considered cooking her own out of their stock, but that would just be wasteful in supplies and also might offend their hosts. She took some time to ensure the camp was in order and nothing happened overnight, before bringing two servings of the breakfast back to Star and sitting down next to where she lay. She stretched her leg out so weight wasn't put on the injured thigh and reached out, lightly placing a hand on Stars shoulder and giving her a gentle shake, emotional guard firmly in place to limit any emotional sharing. "Star, you need to get some food in you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The bustle was normal. The air was normal. The shadow was nowhere to be seen or felt. It was just another, normal day. Star looked calm, not at all like a nightmare plagued her. When Ellesandra roused her, she slowly stirred and rubbed at one eye as she slowly came to wake. She looked up at Ellesandra and offered a warm, tender, sleepy smile. "Good morning," she said quietly with a sleepy lilt. "Food...Food sounds good, mmnh." That was enough to get Star slowly rising, still clearly lethargic. Her nose was no longer bloody, and the marks of blood on her dress that were definitely there last night were now...Gone. But all that aside, Star took a few minutes to work up to wakefulness. She had a heavy weight dragging her down with every step, but she was...Happy. She was very clearly happy as she went about her morning routine and sat with Ellesandra for them all to enjoy a morning breakfast that was...Of passing quality. Good enough, filling enough, with at least some delightful fiery char on the meats cooked that had a natural, satisfying quality to it, even if there was nothing in the way of spice. It was a good morning.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched as Star roused and began moving about. She was watching for any sign of injury or worse fatigue that would be of concern, but so far she'd seen none. The blood was gone from her nose, which was good. She considered talking about the shadow in her dream, but didn't quite yet. Let both of then enjoy the morning, fully wake up and then discuss the unpleasantness of that visit. And so, Ellesandra sat to eat the camp food. It was obviously not the best, but also not the worst food she'd had. Despite trying to relax and enjoy the food, which her body desperately needed, there was now a constant paranoia. If the shadow creature could possess people like it had the captain and the pirates, they weren't exactly safe just because they were with the elves. She thought of the gem in her pocket, then shook her head and looked around at the rest of the camp. "We should take advantage of what rest we can get now. I'm still unsure how wise it would be to go into town, and I don't think going back to the settlement with the Elves is on our way to Myst, is it?" It had been a while since Ellesandra had looked at a map, and while she knew the general location of places she'd been, she hadn't been to Myst before. Thus, she was going to be relying on Star - or perhaps seeking to purchase a map- for their direction and guiding. Her job was to keep Star safe, whether that be against mundane people or shadow controlled ones.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
 Star was obviously tired. Her marching would not be wise, that much was obvious. Light travel would be okay, but long distances would require more rest before such a journey. Ellesandra's question about Myst had some of the other elves looking at each other and shrugging. Clearly, they'd never heard of it. Star shook her head. "Part of the way there is shared, but the elvish settlement was north-west, and the directions he showed me on the map have us going north-east. There's...Some degree of shared passage. It's closer physically than Cloverport is. Morrun told us we have to find the people who were from Myst. Sort of...Requires someone who knows how to get there, to get there. As I understand from his explanation, it's not just a place we can walk to. It's a plane all its own. We'll be traveling to another plane of existence to get there, and from there doing the same to get to my home, if his theories and understanding of it all prove to be true," said Star as she finished her breakfast. "I agree that we ought to rest. I don't know that town is dangerous right now, but I'm fine resting in the woods for now if you are uneasy about it. Still. We'll make better time and exhaust ourselves less if we can hire a coach in town."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star, glancing at the nearby elves who seemed confused, then sighed and grumbled. "Have to know someone? I hate knowing people. Means you have to talk to them." The comment was mostly made in jest, trying to inject humor into the camp and Star, even if it wasn't entirely false. Ellesandra was an introvert through and through; guarded because of her trauma and not willing to open up to anyone. Talking to people led to friendships which led to expectation of opening up. So in a way, she was being entirely truthful with the comment. Finishing up her food, she wiped her hands to get rid of the crumbs that might have lasted on her fingers or any of the meat juices, then moved to stand and stretch again. Her muscles ached and she winced, imagining marching back to the elven settlement feeling like this. Even if she could make it, she was almost certain Star wouldn't. "Okay, we can try town. I'll be sure to sleep lightly tonight and we'll see if we can get a room with two beds, so we can be in the same room should anyone try to sneak in." Getting a room at the inn would potentially put a target on them, but it was probably less dangerous than camping in the woods alone. There was no telling if someone might go on a hunt for any stragglers of the army, or looters for anything left behind. Even if the Pirates wouldn't hold a grudge, Ellesandra was not fully betting on that. "Do you think you can make the hike down to the Inn, though? Or should we set up some place nearby to rest more?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star giggled at her companions response. "I'm fine with doing the talking, though you shouldn't sell yourself short. You're plenty likable, whether you like it or not," she said with amusement and affection in equal measure. She wouldn't turn down a chance to be kind to Ellesandra. "I can manage getting into town, it's not that far. I'm not entirely disabled, just want to take it easy today is all. I'm ready to head out when you are."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't quite know how to take the compliment. A huff was all that came out, but there was definitely a stirring of something in her chest. She couldn't identify it - or more like didn't want to identify it - but it was definitely something akin to the way a school girl blushed when given a compliment and her stomach got butterflies. Focusing instead on their plan for the day, Ellesandra grabbed her pack and slung it over her good shoulder, looking down to check to ensure her thigh or arm didn't need rebandaging. The shrapnel hadn't gone so far in that it had bled overnight; it probably had already clotted and was in the process of healing, but she didn't want to replace the bandages quite yet. Walking might reopen the one on her thigh, and she could deal with that when they got to town. "I wasn't claiming you were disabled, I just wanted to ensure that if you needed rest still, you knew we had options. You pushing yourself to the point of collapse can not be a consistent thing. I've known you for just under three full days now and two of those days have come with you doing something reckless that made you fatigued." Granted, those same two days had seen Ellesandra get injured too, but she wasn't about to admit that - or how fatigued she was. She could certainly do a hike to town, but a hike to the elven settlement would have been pushing it for herself as well. "Do we need to report to - actually. Can you point me to any of the magic users here? I'd like to see if they could help check out the gem that was in the Captain's heart before we leave, to ensure it isn't cursed or going to explode on me or anything."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled at the bashful huff. Star hadn't lost her ability to see emotion overnight, so it got her smiling a big, dopey smile for it. She said nothing, however. She just let them huff and save face. On the matter of Star pushing herself to the limit, she pouted playfully. "When we stop getting into life or death situations, I'll stop pushing with all I've got, how's that sound?" she asked with a playful smile. And then, when asked for Star to point out the magic users, she just...Raised a brow and pointed to herself.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra huffed again at the life or death situation comment. "Well if someone wasn't such a meddler, we wouldn't have been in either of those situations." That was probably inaccurate, and Ellesandra wasn't actually upset at Star for meddling. In reality, she would have wanted to do the same had she been on her own, but if she were on her own things probably would have ended very poorly for her. Her hand moved up to her throat and touched the sensitive bruising that was there still, wincing at the thought, then looking back to Star when she pointed to herself regarding the magic user. Rolling her eyes, Ellesandra shook her head and dropped her voice to a whisper. "Considering the shadow demon thing came OUT of this gem and seems hell bent on ensuring you do not continue with your goal of finding your mother, I do not want you touching it at all. There's no telling what kind of trap or curse it might put on you if you do." Hell, she wasn't entirely comfortable carrying it around herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star squinted playfully at Ellesandra, flashing a knowing smile. She had every belief that the knight would not be able to walk away from another in need, just as they hadn't with her. She then sighed through her nose at Ellesandra's worries, at least agreeing that they were valid it seemed as she pointed to the circle of three other elves who were finishing their breakfast. Robed elves who were part of the group of healers. "If you insist, talk to them. But I don't really sense any malicious presence from it. Or much of any magic, though I'm sure it might be different if I held it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pretending not to notice the squint or smile. Instead, she shook her head. "Oh yeah, I'm sure it might be different if you held it. It might possess you and turn you into a creature who doesn't die when I stab him in the head." She paused, then corrected. "Her, in your case." Okay, maybe she was just a little salty about how the pirate didn't die like he should have. She needed to adjust how she planned to fight any other creature she sensed the shadow in, going forward. Hopefully it wouldn't be any creatures, but she doubted that was likely if she continued with Star. Instead of continuing on about that, though, she followed Star's point to one of the robed elves and approached, waving awkwardly to get their attention as she did. "Good morning-" Her voice was stilted, awkward, randomly talking to a stranger to make a request which might endanger them. She honestly didn't want to, but felt like she needed to. "I was wondering - when I killed the captain yesterday, he didn't die normally. Had to stab him through the heart despite stabbing him in the head, and apparently he was being kept alive by this gem..." She reached into her pocket, ensuring skin didn't contact that gem when she pulled it out. "And I was led to believe it might still have a few traces of magic in it. I was wondering if one of you could help check to see what kind of magic, if it's cursed or needs to be destroyed somehow?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded, though she could tell that the knight was bothered by the outcome of fight. Or what it took to get there at least. She could hardly blame them. "I thought for sure you had him. I was relived. But then, when it wasn't the end, well...That's when I lost it, sorta. I'm...Still trying to figure out where that all came from." She gave a soft smile, assuring she was fine, at least would be until Ellesandra came back from the others. The elves in question smiled at Ellesandra, hearing their request. One of them held their hand out to take the gem. When they took it, the elf focused on the gem for a moment. They lightly glowed with mana. A bit of time passed. When they finished, they held the gem back out to Ellesandra. "There was some sort of enchantment on this gemstone. Only broken echoes remain. I could not tell you the purpose, other than it was quite powerful to still have such a presence when broken like this. That said...The spell is broken. It has no effects now that I can detect. Only a malevolent whisper that is fading slowly. I imagine it will lose its power in a few days, possibly crumbling to nothingness from there. If it was within the pirate, then it certainly explains what gave him such power. But with it being so broken, the finer details of what it was supposed to do are lost."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. They would talk about Star's magic use later; when they were alone. While the mage was examining the stone, Ellesandra was patient. She watched the stone carefully, to ensure that the process of identifying it didn't cause any types of chain reaction or something, but eventually she was told that it was turning to a normal stone - maybe even would crumble away into dust. She pursed her lips, looking down at the gem and taking it back when it was offered. A brief though of just tossing it away into the woods with all her strength crossed her mind briefly, but she instead pocketed it again with a nod. "Thanks for the confirmation." If it still had whispers of malevolence, it was possible for someone to randomly stumble upon it and maybe unintentionally empower it again, right? She wouldn't take the chance of throwing it away only for it to harm someone else. She'd let it crumble away in her pocket, instead. With a nod to the healers, she headed back to Star, nodding. "Okay, we should be good to head out. The gem apparently is of no immediate danger, and might fall apart on it's own in a bit of time. Until then, I don't really want a stranger to stumble upon it, so I'll carry it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to Ellesandra. "That is a wise choice I think. Even if it's harmless now, no reason to not be cautious and handle it with care until it's gone," she said, working up to her feet. Being good to head out, Star set about towards the city. Her pace was slow. Cautious to not rush either of them. There was time to chat along the way, though silence wouldn't be broken by Star. Just some smiles now and then. Even in the wake of battle, so long as evil did not win, it seemed there was no shaking Star's pleasant spirit.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star move to stand, taking up that protective stance close to her in case she needed assistance. They had both worn themselves out the day before; Star probably more so. Ellesandra's fatigue was muscle weariness, but she'd gone through this plenty of times when forced to use her haste magic like that. She would be sore and feeling it the entire walk back, but she wasn't about to collapse. Star, however, had magically exhausted herself - again. After having done so just recently, Ellesandra was worried about her stamina and ability to make this trek. Still, she didn't say anything as they collected their things and began the hike down to the town, staying close enough to reach out and take an arm or help steady Star if needed. She didn't speak, not really having much to say in her normal no-small-talk way, and also wanting to ensure that they could focus on their trip and not get distracted or fall due to it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star managed to keep steady. She wouldn't turn down Ellesandra's arm if offered, but it was taken with a tenuous grasp. Her ability to maintain the emotional wall in tandem with the knight was a little fragile. A steady stream of connected emotions, echoes of the other person, would bleed through while connected. So if the desire was to hold on anyway, there would be plenty of Star's serene, pleasant happiness to feel bleeding through the connection, muted and muffled by the attempts to solidify the barrier between them, as well as an ever-present concern for the other woman. Regardless, the walk proved uneventful and the people in town were working with some of the elvish soldiers to clean up the mess. The bombs had left scorched stone in some places, broken patches of stone in others, some minor property destruction to be found, and plenty of mopping to deal with the spatters of blood. Among the people were what appeared to be city guardsman, who hadn't been too great in number before the war, but seemed to be far more numerous now. Where did they all come from? Where were they when the city needed them? Questions remained unanswered for the moment. But nobody seemed hostile, either. Rather, the people seemed cordial. Thankful. There'd be no resistance to walking into the inn to book a room for the night, as if nothing even happened. There was some lingering fear on the faces of the people but...More than anything, relief.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked around, both on guard and cautious, but also feeling for the citizens. While they obviously looked relieved to have the pirates gone and no longer be under their spell or rule, there had obviously been damage and likely deaths. She kept a special eye on the city guard she saw; it was entirely possible they had been under some sort of magic just like the pirates had been, but it was also possible they'd simply been paid off, so until anything was clear Ellesandra was going to be on guard. She stayed closer to Star than normal, just far enough away she could avoid touching Star unless necessary, to make it clear that they were together and Star was under her protection. When they got to the Inn, she would first go about requesting a room for the night and more food. It wasn't that it was that long since they'd begun their trek that morning and eaten breakfast, but they both needed to rejuvenate a lot of energy - be it physical or magical - and food would help with this. She didn't go straight up to their room, but would indicate Star find a table to sit at and join her after ordering food -extra fruits and veggies for Star - and some water, and leaning against the table across from her. "We should talk about the shadow. I had another dream last night. Ellesandra kept her voice low, but felt no need to hide this from Star. If anything, Star deserved to know what she was potentially up against, on this journey.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was certainly feeling for the people as well. Perhaps better than anyone else could. No immediate signs of civilian deaths could be observed, but it's possible the dead had all been carted away already to be buried. It certainly put a damper on Star's smile, though she sought solace in the fact that their actions were simply dousing an infected wound with medicine. Pain felt now to save greater pain later. There was only so much that could comfort her, of course. Being given an extra helping of her preferred food from her knightly companion, a small showing of thoughtfulness, did bring her spirits up a little once more, however. It wasn't the food that made her smile, but rather that her companion noticed and remembered such things. They could hide behind the guise of duty all day, but Star had an advantage in her sight that made such lies even more flimsy than they were on the surface. She was clearly still hungry as she began into her food, though politely paused when acknowledging the other's words. "Is that so?" she asked with a troubled tone, kept low all the same. They had a booth together that would allow them to keep their discussion private enough, so long as they were mindful with their volume. "Please...Do tell."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked down at her own plate, spearing a piece of an egg and chewing it slowly while considering how to approach this topic. She probably should have considered that more on the walk here, or even explained it on the walk, but she had wanted to look into Star's eyes while explaining it. To see how Star reacted to some of the news, or if Star had intentionally been hiding the resonance bit from her for some reason. She chewed slowly while considering before looking up to her. "Well, there was a lot discussed. In summary, you and I share a 'resonance' which is apparently the connection between your magic and why it's so easy for you to interact with my emotions. Not a fan of that, by the way." That probably didn't need to be said; Star fully well knew by now that Ellesandra was a very private person about her thoughts and emotions and found it invasive that Star could just see that naturally. "And that the enemy of this shadow creature, unnamed, is what organized us coming together. The shadow creature orchestrated all of this, and has multiple other servants like the captain being controlled by some gem like thing. And they're set against you reaching your destination; claiming that if I go with you it will empower you to continue rather than giving up and lead to both of our deaths." She paused, trying to think if there was anything else she'd missed in that very high level summary. "And encouraging me to abandon you because you won't be as likely to get close, and thus die, to your destination. Oh, and that if you made it to Myst you'd die. So, we're on the right track, at least." She began to reach for the water, then paused. "And I think they confirmed that they were the influence that took your previous guardian from you. Unclear, by that point I was getting a headache at it's damn political talk of walking around a point."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star wore a little pout when Ellesandra made a point of how they weren't a fan. A face that spoke of how she wasn't really able to control it. "It's not normal for me, either," she said quietly, still pouting a bit. "But...Are you sure? I've...Never been fully resonant with someone before," she said, which then prompted her to blush. "...A-Are you...Sure that is the word the shadow used?" she asked, with her embarrassment to the fact alluding to there being more to it than the shadow had told. She had to ponder the other parts. The enemy of the shadow got them together? Was that a good thing? It was a lot to take in. But the overall message was clearly one of trying to dissuade the pair from continuing. "Mmnh....And, well. I won't stop. But I also hope you know that you're not...Bound to me. Forced to be here, or anything. N-Not that I...Want you to go, or anything. Quite the opposite. But given how much has happened in just the few days you've known me I wouldn't blame you now or ever if you decided your path went elsewhere. Not...Advocating for it. Just making sure you know that I care about you and your choice in the matter, whatever it may be. So long as it's your true feelings."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned at Star's reaction to the word resonant. The blush made her tilt her head, eyes narrowing curiously and observing what she could of the mage before her. "Yes, I'm pretty sure it used the word resonance. Explained that it's some musical harmony between aura's or something." A brief wave of her hand. She hadn't fully understood what it was talking about. "And how it usually builds over time from some sort of emotion, I'm assuming a loyalty or bond or love or something like that. And that for it to have been a natural, immediate occurrence for us was rare, which is honestly just a little more annoying." She paused after saying this, guilt creeping in again. She knew this wasn't Star's fault, and didn't want her to constantly feel bad about something she could control. Picking up a piece of bacon, she chewed on it and leaned back into her seat, glancing around the Inn for a generic perusal and ensuring they hadn't drawn any unwelcome attention so far. "I'm not leaving, and while it seems like you stopping your journey would be the best thing for your safety, I both don't believe you will and also refuse to give into the obvious manipulations of some sort of higher power. Confirmed not deity, at least by it's own mouth, but still some sort of higher asshole being." Ellesandra obviously didn't like being directed by any form of 'fate' or manipulated by those who thought they were simply beyond mortal.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile. "Then we're agreed that I was already going to do all of this, but someone telling me not to is just going to make me do it even harder," she said, her smile growing playful. A little light-heartedness, for the daunting task grew ever more daunting with the knowledge of such an enemy that would see them fail. She paused to bite into the apple she had and thoughtfully chew it before circling back. "...What they said about resonance is true, at least insofar as what my mother told me. My two mothers had resonance with one another, though it was not immediate. Auras grow more naturally attuned to each other in time, with longer exposure. At some point you'll be able to see my natural aura to some degree, though without my gift it might not make much sense. Colourful, if nothing else. I don't want to bore you with the ins and outs of it all. But when we first met I'm sure you noticed how I stared at you for so long. I've never felt a connection to another's aura like this before, and I've been trying to figure it out. I...Hadn't assumed it was full resonance; like you were told, it's exceptionally rare. Enough that in all my travels you're the first." Lucky them. If anything, Star assumed Ellesandra found it to be more of a curse than a blessing. "...But without taking the time for us to expose our auras together, resonance does little beyond act as a strong...Compatibility. Musical harmony is a decent way to think of it I guess. It's the first time I've had to actively separate our auras as they try to mingle when we touch, like I said. But...Resonance..." Once more, there was some allusion to potential benefits to be gained from this quality, though Star seemed to assume Ellesandra wanted nothing to do with any of it. Or maybe just didn't want to babble magical words at them over second breakfast.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't actually noticed how Star had stared at her, not really. She'd just thought the staring was hoping that Ellesandra would help her, trying to plead with her silently or something. The intense stare hadn't been out of the normal, and as they'd walked to town she'd figured Star was just seeing her emotions, once that became a thing that Ellesandra knew Star could do. Ellesandra did have a lot of them, even if they were repressed, so it hadn't been abnormal for her. The idea of her being Star's first, in regards to this resonance thing, was just her damn luck. Or, this strange other figure who had orchestrated them together. She hadn't forgotten about that, and though it irritated her she didn't really have a purpose of just stewing in said irritation. "Well, I'm not a musician, so I'm not about to be making any kind of aura harmony with you intentionally." A joke, to try to lighten the mood a little. And get them off such a serious topic in which Ellesandra was feeling both distaste for how invasive Star's power was, and also guilty at that feeling because she knew it wasn't something Star was choosing to do. She didn't hold it against Star, per say, but it still made her even more cautious and guarded around her than she might be - and that was a little unfair. She finished off the last of her plate and slid it to the side, taking a longer drink of water and gazing out into the Inn again. "I'm getting the sense your magic would be stronger if I let this resonance or whatever work, but I'm not going to just let you in. I'm not okay with that. So I'm drawing a firm boundary here, okay?" She didn't look at Star as she said this, unsure what refusing that might mean for Star - or even she even could control this at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "There's a reason I didn't bring up all the ways it could be beneficial to our adventures. You don't need to redraw boundaries that you've already drawn," she said with a voice that was two parts respectful to one part...Sad. Perhaps disappointed. But there was resignation which joined her tone, an acceptance despite her own desires for the state of affairs. She looked at the last remnants of her food, moving a finger to roll a lone blueberry that she was saving for last around on her plate in little circles. She didn't look at Ellesandra either as she continued to speak. "I'm doing what I can to keep the boundary firm between us...I just need you to know that anything that might spill through that isn't intentional. I'm a little out of my depth with you. But it...At the very least allows my sympathetic healing to be most effective on you, and effortlessly performed, should we need to leverage it. Should you permit it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt - was it pain? No, it wasn't quite pain, but the guilt and feeling bad about causing that sadness in Star was so similar to the guilt and pain combination she felt for Marigold that she felt it like that. Her jaw clenched, knowing that this boundary was something Star might not like or understand. Star was too willing and open to share things, and Ellesandra the exact opposite. How their 'auras' could have any form of harmony with how different they were was beyond the knight. She snorted at the sympathetic healing bit, mumbling - "Great, an easier way for my mistakes to cause someone else pain." She didn't refuse it, though. Star had a good point that, in the moment, it might be absolutely necessary. And if it were, Ellesandra would accept it - but ONLY if she agreed it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise, she was going to keep that rule of it not happening firmly in place. "So, next steps. Go find someone who has come from Myst and encourage them to lead us back there, somehow." Her arms crossed and she finally turned fully to look at Star again. "I think we should stay here at least two days before we start on that, assuming the place continues to be hospitable. We both need that rest, and we'll reassess the second day on if we need to stay longer to recover or are fine to head out afterwards. Does that sound like a plan?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There wasn't enough ambient noise to drown out Ellesandra's mumbling. It was likely intended to just vent internal frustrations, but the comment...It struck Star deep. A mix of sorrow and anger swirled in her, leaving her uncharacteristically silent and focused on her plate as Ellesandra got down to business. Normally quite attentive and chipper, the empath looked like someone sucked the wind out of her sails in the moment. Enough that when the knight asked if it sounded like a plan, they earned only a set of three small nods from Star as she continued to circle that blueberry around on her plate under the pad of her index finger.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She noticed star staring at her plate, but she'd been staring it for a while so Ellesandra hadn't thought anything of it. It wasn't until Star gave just a few small nods that Ellesandra stopped and examined Star closer. Guilt rose again, gnawing at her. But what the hell was she guilty of? For having a boundary? Anger swirled among it, that her having boundaries was harder on Star, that Star could so easily feel and unintentionally slip past those boundaries. She reigned it in though, knowing that being angry at Star wasn't right, and it would just later make her feel even more guilty for how Star would likely react to it. She was the type you had to treat with a very gentle hand, sensitive in more ways than one but willing to be stubborn and stand up against you. Ellesandra sighed, rubbing at her right shoulder and the scar beneath her armor and clothes unconsciously. She couldn't even touch it directly due to her armor, but the habit was there. She didn't know how to handle Star and her openness compared to Ellesandra's own closed off behavior, so instead Ellesandra didn't say anything. She would sit there silently, eyeing the last bit of blueberry on Star's plate for a moment before turning her eyes out to look into the Inn and keep watch until Star was ready to chat or go up to their room; because Ellesandra had insisted on a single room with two beds.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star eventually plucked the blueberry and placed it between her lips. She closed her eyes, pensively savouring the tart, sweet berry for a moment. She remained quiet for a while longer. Whatever it was that ate at her was deep in her heart, clearly. "We should go up to the room, let you get out of your armor if you intend on it. I should focus on meditating." Despite stating this, she didn't immediately rise, waiting for Ellesandra to do so and lead the way.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star spoke again, Ellesandra turned to look at her, then nodded. She very much did want to get out of her armor, having slept in it the night before as well. It was never comfortable to do so, and she knew her underclothes were extremely sweaty right now. Moving to stand and grab her bag, she left the plates and everything on the counter for the waitress. She didn't just walk away, standing beside the table and waiting to ensure Star could stand and didn't need help, and then leading them upstairs to the room the innkeep had indicated. A glance was given around to ensure there weren't any watchers or sentient looking shadows nearby, before opening the door and stepping in. A quick sweep was given around the room as well before stepping to the side to let Star enter, and to confirm that the room was indeed a two bed room. If there was one she'd give it to Star, but it would be nice to have one herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star stood silently and moved with the knight. The room was as described. There were no menacing looking shadows. There might have been a moment where it seemed there were monsters under the bed, but upon closer inspection it would be just a dust bunny moving with the wind of the door opening. A small attached room had a shower to enjoy. A bit cramped, but serviceable. A stack of white towels was also supplied to be used as needed. The sheets and bedding were white. Clean. The two beds were comfortable enough. Far better than a bedroll, but otherwise mediocre. Star wordlessly entered when permitted, and helped herself to seat herself on her bed, electing to stare at the floor for a little while. They had two days to burn, now.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the silence like a damn weight. Normally, she was comfortable with silence - enjoyed it, even. But this silence from Star wasn't natural. She didn't know what it was that she'd done that had upset Star, but something obviously had. Was it the comments about boundaries? She wasn't sure, but with the door closed she watched Star for a few moments, just staring at the floor. Aggravation at herself and her inability to comfort a stranger, how awkward she was with people, built up. She didn't say anything, though. Instead she checked the attached shower room for danger, then set about taking her armor off. It was a relatively long process doing it herself, and in her muscle's weakened state causing the soreness to spike when reaching for the straps beneath her arms. It took about ten minutes to be stripped down to her leggings and tight undershirt, both of which were rank and covered in sweat and blood from the battle and then sleeping in them. She moved to her back and pulled out a change of clothes, laying them to the side. Her right shoulder in particular was bothering her, a symptom of the guilt that seemed to creep up when she was feeling particularly bad, and now it being free she reached and lightly massaged at the damaged muscle at the top. She didn't go straight for the shower though, like she wanted to. She wanted to rinse the stink and blood of her wounds away, change her wound dressings and check on her ribs. Instead, she sat on her own bed and motioned with her head for Star to take the first shower. "Yours if you want it first." The first words spoken to her since arriving, the tension of whatever was wrong having been left to build or go away on it's own.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took a look over Ellesandra as they took off their clothes. The offer was enough to lighten her mood a tiny bit, enough to eke out a tiny smile. Thoughtful as always. "I mean this in the absolute most respectful way I can possible say it, Ellesandra...You need it first." She smiled again. "You look like you were suffering under your armor. So please. I think it's best I take time to meditate for a moment anyway." Her tone lowered as she spoke, moving to a bit over a whisper by the end. That was all she seemed to have to say on the matter, then went back to staring at the floor.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't disagree. She knew she stunk right now, but had been used to this before. Still, at the confirmation to do it first Ellesandra had stood. She watched Star seem to disappear into herself again, a frown crossing her face and concern now showing. This wasn't just a little feeling bad, was it? Star was troubled by something, relatively deeply. Ellesandra stood awkwardly for a moment, not knowing how to approach the topic, before she shook her head. Best not to, since she was probably the one who had caused the issue to begin with. Knowing herself, she'd just make it worse. So, Ellesandra turned to the shower. "Don't open the door for anyone until I'm out." The warning came over her shoulder as she was pulling her jerkin off. She didn't have any concerns with modesty, but she did close the door to just a crack. Open enough that she'd easily be able to hear if anything went wrong in the main room, but closed enough that no one would just see her standing nude in there. There was a chance, if Star had looked up and seen her as she was walking in, that Star would have seen the scars across Ellesandra's back. Whip marks for the most part, as well as an ugly scar that was on the back of her right shoulder where some sort of blade had pierced straight through her shoulder. Harder to see was another one further down her right arm, between her elbow and shoulder. And lastly, a thin scar on her left rib where someone had obviously cut deep into it from the side. There was also a noticeable lack of muscle definition on her right side, when compared to that of her left. With her back turned to Star as she entered, it was only briefly - but Ellesandra's lack of modesty or attempting to hide said scars spoke to a likelihood of Star seeming them later on in their travels anyways. She took a quick shower, assuming no interruptions, using the water and a little bit of a lavender scented soap she carried in her pack in a wood box to help with the worst of the stench. She kept the old bandages on her wounds for now, planning to change them out after rather than removing to be stung by the water. She did dry off inside and put on her clothes with the door just cracked before re-entering the bedroom, doing another quick glance around to ensure Star was still there, and safe.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star flicked her eyes at Ellesandra as they moved into the shower. Enough to catch a glimpse, but little more. She sat with the knowledge for a while. Specifically, as long as Ellesandra took to shower. No disturbances came. When the other woman emerged, Star was seated on her bed, the one closer to the wall as she imagined Ellesandra would prefer the one closer to the door for the security of the arrangement, with legs folded and hands in a meditative position upon her knees. Her aura was visible in this moment. A swath of blue that flowed in wispy waves up along her figure. Her aura was a beautiful sight to behold; the colour was vivid, though ethereal and transparent. There was no real influence of emotion while looking upon it, though one could imagine Star saw something similar, but around all other people. Except Star could read it. What just appeared to be colourful to the knight held a wealth of information for someone like Star. Enough to see mountains that weren't there. Enough to know when someone was lying. Enough to see straight through someone's emotional armor. Yet in return, even when her aura was plainly visible to the naked eye, it gave...Nothing. Just a pretty, enchanting blue colour that clung to her. She seemed focused on this, though soon after Ellesandra came out of the shower, she naturally concluded whatever she was meditating on. Her aura vanished slowly, then, as she looked pensively at...The floor again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pulled up to a stop when she saw the blue aura around Star. She stared at it in confusion at first, then once she realized what she was seeing she quickly turned away. If it was her aura, or her emotions, she had no right to stare at it and try to figure it out - not when she spent so much effort on building a barrier and boundary between herself and Star. Sitting on what would be her bed, she pulled her hair up into a ponytail so the wet strands would be out of her face, only glancing over at Star when she heard Star moving out of the meditative state. The continued pensive look at the floor made Ellesandra feel like something was terribly wrong. For someone like Star, to go so long like this without saying anything, what was she working through? The blue aura came to mind, but Ellesandra had no idea what that would mean. Her only guess was sadness, but just because something was blue didn't mean it was necessarily sad, right? And even so there was probably way more niche information that Ellesandra didn't know what to look for, even if she had wanted to. Still, the possibility that she'd done something to so thoroughly upset Star that she had gone silent and staring at random things bothered Ellesandra enough to speak up and break the silence. "What exactly has you so quiet and introspec-introver-er." Introspective was the word she was going for, but the way to say it was slipping her mind. She blinked, thinking, and having a complete brain fart on it shook her head. "thoughtful?" She finished, reaching into her bag for the medical supplies to begin working on rebandaging her arm, raising her sleeve up to do so.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked up when Ellesandra stumbled over their words. She gave them a smile. No judgement, just patience as they figured out what they were trying to say. She then had to stare at Ellesandra for a few moments as she gathered what she wanted to say. "...I can't tell you, Ellesandra," she said, still smiling a small, sad smile. "It'll just lead to questions that I can't ask, and topics that aren't allowed. I'll be okay. Promise. I just...Need some time to feel sad. The sad feeling won't go away until I...Feel it. Let it be felt. Let it...Naturally flow through me. It'll be okay." An attempt at a reassuring smile followed, though it wasn't...Very reassuring at all. Star still wore her emotions plainly. And she was hurting inside. She fought against that hurt, trying desperately to put on a smile to allow Ellesandra to be happy, too. Or as happy as they could be, given the mountain that didn't exist that wasn't weighing on them at all.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It took Ellesandra a moment to realize what she meant. Was she sad for Ellesandra? Because of her being so guarded? Or was that pity? Defensiveness rose in her and she shifted a little uncomfortably, thinking of what Star might feel she couldn't ask or topics that weren't allowed. The concept of just letting herself feel sad was foreign to Ellesandra though; sadness was a weakness. She didn't let herself feel it, only feeling it when it forced itself out. Shaking her head, she turned her attention to the bandaging and ensuring that the cut in her arm was healing decently enough. She'd do her thigh afterwards, just taking them one step at a time. "You're allowed to ask anything, just respect me being allowed to say no or not answer." She hadn't been sure she wanted to open that door; it was probably easier for Star to just not ask when Ellesandra knew she'd stonewall the mage anyways. But the idea that Star thought she couldn't even ask potentially unrelated questions bothered Ellesandra; her boundary was around herself, not around Star's ability to ask questions.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to the words given. "I do. And I also don't want to fight with you, even a little. So it's prudent for me to acknowledge when the things I feel, the things I want to say, are only going to lead us towards my desire to...Talk to you about things you do not want to talk about, and your desire to, well...Not. It's just hard for me, y-you know?" she said, doing her best to repress what was clearly a rising sorrow that threatened to make her cry. Her voice shook, but she paused to breathe and steady herself, keeping her on the calm side of things. "I can't help who I am. I can't help that hearing about how you blame yourself tears me up inside. And I don't even want to say such things...Because then, well...Is that not just all the more likely to make you redouble your desire to push it all down? To pound upon your heart with an iron first until it submits, not caring for what wounds you leave in the wake?" She bit her lip here. "Just...I'll stop. Before I get carried away. I have...Too much to say, and as I said I...Can't bear to argue with you. I don't want to. It hurts..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked up after finishing her bandage, watching Star struggle to keep her voice calm, to repress the tears. The guilt built again, but she also pushed it back down again. Then winced when Star called her out for doing that exact thing. She couldn't win, could she? How was she supposed to respond to this? The only way she thought Star would be okay with her responding to it would be to completely open up, but Ellesandra wasn't okay with that, so they were very much at odds there. She pursed her lips, watching Star for a moment, then stood and walked over to her. Sitting down on the bed next to Star, she raised her arm to begin wrapping it around Star. She went slowly, so that Star could pull away if she wasn't okay with that, but would allow space for Star to be pulled into her side and place her head on Ellesandra's shoulder, should she wish. The touch was hesitant. Ellesandra's emotional barriers were up as strongly as she could put them up, even if they weren't entirely effective. But she didn't want Star repressing emotions just for her. Ellesandra repressed emotions for herself; Star didn't. "If you need to cry, and you're comfortable with doing it, then do so. No words are necessary for why." She held back an apology, wanting to tell her she was sorry for how much baggage she brought with her. She was also supremely uncomfortable with offering this touch, but if it was a matter of making Star feel better, or living in her own discomfort, she would choose Star's feelings every time. At least, in something as small as just offering physical touch as support.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star might have been able to see the internal struggle Ellesandra faced, if she was looking at them. But she shifted her head back to looking at the floor. Her favourite patch of floor, in fact, in this whole room. She only did look up again when Ellesandra rose to move over to her bed. She was uncertain how to feel about it, but she didn't have much time before Ellesandra joined her and opened an arm to her, then went beyond a mere offer to forwardly bring her into a hug. She wouldn't have the emotional fortitude to resist a hug from Ellesandra at her apex, so feeling so vulnerable in the moment she was helpless. She leaned against them, rested her head against their shoulder, and quietly let a few tears flow from her. One hand moved along their back, the other slid up to their opposite shoulder to gently cling to it. Her eyes closed and she simply...Basked in the comfort Ellesandra's hug gave her. It didn't fix anything. It just...Helped. Made the hurt quiet. She had no reservations crying in front of Ellesandra, even if the reverse wasn't true. But with the comforts provided, Star was not breaking down into sobs. Just a silent stream of tears, free from sobs. Maybe the occasional sniffle. Truly, it did help her. The emotional barriers were raised, but there still was some amount of...Leakage that seemed to be unable to be closed. As if the dam was permanently damaged. Was it because Star was unable to maintain her side of it? Certainly, she was more capable of it than Ellesandra's budding control over it. Or perhaps it was more to do with the resonance? Either way, some of Star's sorrow leaked through into Ellesandra. Not to force them to feel the same, but for them to have that, perhaps familiar at this point, out-of-body understanding of the emotion that Star felt, exactly as she felt it. It carried echoes disturbingly similar to Ellesandra's own guilt. The desire to help...The contested sensation of inadequacy...The self-sacrificial desire to take pain unto one's self...A pain that resonated with flickers of guilt, of ownership. Star's emotions were complex, perhaps only because she allowed herself to feel them all; by contrast, Ellesandra might struggle to feel little beyond guilt overwhelming at times. But Star? Star let her emotions flow free in her heart. The clashing of guilt, of sorrow, of determination, of everything she could feel in the moment all at once. And though Ellesandra was feeling only a tiny echo of it, the complexity, even if not the raw intensity, was plain for them to feel. Sitting behind that dam was a wave of emotion that would dwarf the mountain of guilt that Ellesandra definitely did not feel. For it was not just emotion on its own; Star's very emotion sung with power within her aura. Even here, in her sadness, the slow blossoming of mana from her heart was clear and trivial to pinpoint in this moment, where it had been so obscure before. From emotion, Star was empowered.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Even through the barrier, she sensed the sorrow and guilt coming from Star as well. Ellesandra winced as she felt it, coming through the apparent aura bond they had, or whatever it was to Ellesandra. She took a deep breath, doing her best to ignore it, and looking away from Star's tears. They made her uncomfortable, and her half hug - while fully intended and not half-hearted, because she did want to make Star feel better - was awkward at best. Still, her eyes turned up to look at the door while Star silently just, felt. She just lived with the sadness that was in her, let it process, and honestly this was something that Ellesandra was a little envious of. The ability to just feel emotions and then have them not be a thing anymore - she didn't think she could do that. The pure depth to Star's emotions rivaled Ellesandra's own - nay, maybe even outdid it, though Ellesandra didn't actually feel them to be able to properly compare. It was almost overwhelming, feeling the pressure behind all of Star's emotion, and how she was just letting it slowly work through herself. She did her best to not let any of this become obvious or noticeable to Star, not wanting to distract Star from how she processed her own emotions, or make her think she needed to take care of Ellesandra instead. There were no words spoke, not unless Star said anything first, Ellesandra just looking around the room quietly and waiting it out, providing physical comfort as essentially the only thing she could do in this situation. Her hand, which had stayed in a single spot on Star's side for a few minutes at first, had begun to lightly rub up and down, like someone might do to one's back when trying to comfort.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The physical comfort continued to be everything that Star needed, short of actually addressing any of...This. Nothing was solved by this moment they shared, but it at least provided Star with gentle reassurances that Ellesandra, to whatever degree, cared about her. Concern enough to be there when she was vulnerable despite their own discomfort. Of course Star could feel the discomfort. The envy. The subtle feeling of being overwhelmed. She could see it in the moments where her eyes were open, even if the direct connection between them had an attempt to block the two off from one another, a barrier both women tried to maintain but ultimately could not perfect. But these things did not distract Star. She accepted the comfort. The gentle rubbing in particular invited her to shuffle just slightly more against the knight and hold just a tiny bit tighter. Ellesandra might feel awkward or uncertain or a thousand other apprehensive emotions at this physical contact, but Star always was, and perhaps always would be, open with such emotion and tenderness around those close to her. Eventually, the tears did stop. Calmness and serenity returned, slowly. It was not happiness that took the place of sorrow, but...Calm neutrality was still a step towards the right direction. Not wishing to further discomfort Ellesandra, Star slowly retreated from the hold once she had weathered the worst of her bubbling emotion. Eyes were a bit puffy, but mostly dry now. Despite this, she still didn't seem to have much to say aside from a quiet, almost inaudible 'Thank you' said as she pulled away and a vaguely forced smile. She retreated into her mind again, staring off at nothing. As promised, she seemed...Okay. A stable state, one that would allow her to hold a conversation if Ellesandra wanted to talk. But whatever deeper, underlying troubles she had remained. The aforementioned forbidden subjects weighed on her still. Truly, it could only be a matter of time before the empath was overcome by her own empathy for someone as deeply troubled as Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She released Star when she started to pull away. The almost inaudible thank you was ignored, if it had been heard at all. As Star pulled away and began staring away again, Ellesandra watched her for a moment. Her concern was only increased with the continued silence. Sure, Star wasn't crying any more, but she obviously still struggled with something. Ellesandra wouldn't push it though, letting Star process whatever was bothering her how she wished, just like Ellesandra would like to do if something was bothering her. Standing, she headed over to her own bed and moved to the side that would have her back to Star, slightly pulling down breeches enough to rebandage the wound on her thigh. Ellesandra didn't bring anything else up, letting the afternoon go silently until or unless Star said anything. She finished replacing the bandage on her thigh after disinfecting the wound with a bit of alcohol, then pulled her breeches back up entirely and turned to lay back on the bed. Her body was still sore, and needed rest, but she didn't sleep, her right arm thrown up to rest across her forehead while she stared up at the ceiling. Quiet and resting her fatigued muscles, but not letting herself fully rest for fear that Star would go do something stupid like sneak out while Ellesandra was asleep and get herself into trouble.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star seemed to deflate a little more as Ellesandra moved away from her. Had they done something wrong? It was impossible to say. She simply was in her own mind, stuck and introspective. But she didn't stop the knight from departing. She just adjusted to delve into meditation again. She remained in this posture for some time; eventually, her aura once again became visible. Where there was one just a solid, medium blue, there was now a swath of colour. She did not glow with any particular luminosity while meditating, so it would not prove to be a disturbance to Ellesandra if they did close their eyes or attempt to sleep. But if they did observe, the colours that mingled into her aura were a complicated mess covering the entire rainbow, every colour fathomable flickering in and out of existence upon her still mostly blue aura. A turbulence, perhaps? Was this what Star saw in others? It was simply...Indecipherable. It had no meaning in the moment, despite it's quiet beauty. She remained in this for hours, silent and unmoving. Night would come before she broke out of this meditative state, unless Ellesandra had reason to disturb her from it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't realize Star had still wanted her there, after pulling away. Ellesandra was the type to want space, and she had just assumed Star had wanted the same once she'd pulled away from the hug. As she lay there and saw the colors out of the corner of her eye, she turned to glance at them. She didn't realize she was staring at first, frowning as she tried to see all the different colors, but then when she realized what she was looking at - the same aura and emotions that Star supposedly saw in other people, an insight to someone's emotions and maybe thoughts, she instantly turned her head away. Star was much more open about her emotions, but Ellesandra still wasn't going to just try to read or decipher what she saw simply because she saw them. As pretty and interesting as the colors were, and odd as it was to see all of them surrounding Star while she meditated, Ellesandra was respecting a privacy that wasn't even asked for; a desire to do the type of thing that she herself wished could be done for her. And so, the majority of the day passed. At some point while Star was meditating, Ellesandra had let herself drift off into a nap. It was one of those hyper aware naps, where any movement or sound caused her eyes to open and to look in that direction. The type of thing someone who was trained to guard someone and be woken by the smallest of things could do easily, but looked like she was just sleeping fitfully to anyone else. She shifted positions a handful of times, just letting the relaxing afternoon work it's magic on healing them. As night approached, she did move to stand and stretch, working out kinks in muscles, before going to the door. She considered interrupting Star to ask what she wanted for dinner, but decided to let her stay in meditation while she slipped out of the room to go get some dinner for them both. About ten minutes later, after Ellesandra had watched the stairs leading to their room like a hawk for any potential danger headed towards Star while waiting for food, she came back in with two steaming plates of food. Some beef and potatoes with a healthy serving of brown gravy over both, and some vegetables. Ellesandra had obviously moved some of the veggies from her own plate over to Star's, but it wasn't like she'd gotten rid of all of her own. "Star." Was all she said as she entered, to ensure that if the movement and noise, or smell of the food, didn't bring Star out of her meditation then maybe her name would.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It was difficult to tell how much awareness Star had while she was meditating. Either she was just unaware of things, or she was aware and just very good at keeping still and not paying mind to them. Not that there was much to disturb her, but it very much did appear she was deep in whatever trance state she had assumed. When Ellesandra returned, the colours had shifted to a uniform, sky blue. No other flecks of other colours to be seen. Hearing her name, however, saw her aura receding again. She looked at Ellesandra and wore a lightly exhausted smile. She was still tired. The meditation seemed to steady her, but more than that it was seeing Ellesandra's thoughtfulness again that had her smiling. She adjusted in her seat on the bed to accept the food, taking note of the adjusted portion. If the meat portions were equal, Star would offer to give about half of her beef portion to the other. After all, it wasn't just that she had her preference, but also that she knew Ellesandra's own. She had noticed the way the knight had delighted in filling their plate with meat just as she delighted in berries and steamed vegetables. It was a perfect balance where each one had the complimentary desire for the less preferred thing on the other's plate. It was a small thing. But as much as the two clashed on the matters of the heart, this was one way in which the two were in perfect harmony with each other. Yet aside from any transactional dialogue, Star still, uncharacteristically, had little to say. Perhaps she was just hungry.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra allowed Star to move some of her meat onto her plate, though was careful to watch how much. Even if Star didn't like meat much, she needed the protein and sustenance to help recover. The continued silence worried Ellesandra, but only in that it was abnormal for Star. She was comfortable with silence, enjoyed it even, so it wasn't the silence itself that bothered her at all. However, the longer it went on as they ate and Star still didn't say anything, seeming withdrawn, the more Ellesandra was concerned for Star's well being. She wanted to ask what was wrong, but knew that doing that would open up conversation paths that would not end well, based on what Star had said previously. It was honestly best to just let the situation lie as it was, trusting Star would get over whatever it was and move on, back to her normal self. Which was exactly what Ellesandra would do. She'd finish her food, and when Star was done she'd take their plates and drinks back downstairs to be washed. When she returned, unless Star would do anything different than normal, Ellesandra would go about nightly activities. She took it easy on any exercise, since her body was still recovering from her haste spell, and simply worked on stretching out her right shoulder muscle to work out the kinks and soreness that came with it whenever she used overused it - which meant anytime she used the haste spell. There were a few twinges of pain, but nothing that was unexpected for old injuries, and afterwards she would lay back down, content to just rest like she'd done the whole day.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The silence was comfortable for Ellesandra, but there were subtle signs that it wasn't ideal for Star. She had a lot on her mind, and she certainly was no stranger to sorting through her emotion, through her thoughts. But even if she smiled when sharing her portion of meat with Ellesandra, mindful to keep some to herself but ensuring of course in turn that the thoughtful sharing of some of the knight's food with her wasn't putting the knight themselves at a caloric deficit, the smile came with a weight hanging on it. The truth of the matter was that what it was at the core wasn't even a terribly big deal. Star being such an emotional woman simply meant that certain things struck her deeply, and she wasn't able to, or perhaps willfully did not hide her emotions like Ellesandra did. Perhaps she could don a mask and Ellesandra would be none the wiser to any of it. But as much as Ellesandra might feel the privacy of emotion was unequal, Star's emotional sensitivity ensured that no special powers were required to read her emotions in the moment. She ate. She was polite. She spoke when spoken to...But she was stuck inside herself for the time being, and if Ellesandra wasn't about to do anything to change it, then Star would go through her nightly routine and settle into bed without a word.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't do anything, not at first. The night passed normally and as Star was beginning to do her nightly wind down activities, Ellesandra suddenly stood and moved to the door. "Be right back." She slipped out, ensuring that Star didn't think she was suddenly leaving or anything. About ten minutes later, she'd return and open the door, but not enter. She was carrying two mugs with some sort of steaming hot liquid in them that smelled of something sweet - chocolate. She stood in the doorway and motioned with her head for Star to follow her. "Come." It was an order, and one that Ellesandra said simply expecting Star to follow along. She'd turn, walking down the hallway, and assuming she didn't get to the door at the end of the hall without Star following her, would open it and lead Star up some stairs. Without a word, she'd hand Star both mugs for a moment, reaching up and pulling down a trap door from the ceiling, which had a ladder that folded out from it. Then taking both cups again, she balanced them between her right arm and her torso to prevent spillage and began climbing the ladder with her left arm mainly, using her right elbow to stabilize on each step. Exiting the top, they were on the roof of the Inn. She ensured Star would get up to the roof without difficulty, then move to find a good place to sit in the center. Not too sloped, so that they didn't have to worry about sliding at all, and not blocked by anything, handing one of the mugs over to Star to smell and drink at her leisure. "Hot chocolate and a starry night, used to be the best to think through things."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wasn't expecting much to happen through the night. So to her surprise, the knight arriving with hot cocoa and a path to the roof of the inn? If not just because she wanted to do as Ellesandra asked unless she had reason not to, the curiosity of it all was enough to motivate her to join along. Her hair was still a bit damp from the shower, given how long and thick it was, but it wouldn't be a risk of a chill even at night. The nights had been warm lately. So when the two arrived on the roof and Star was able to secure a seat next to the knight, she had a small smile. She looked into her hot cocoa. The answers weren't there, but that didn't stop her from looking for them. "...Thoughtful as ever," she said quietly. The proximity almost ensured that Ellesandra would hear, but she was speaking to herself. Then, she spoke to Ellesandra directly. "I appreciate this. And I won't say that the company and ambiance doesn't help, because it does...But it's not really a matter of thinking things through for me. I promised I'd be okay, didn't I? I'm...Okay."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's anxiety seemed to spike a little when Star said she didn't have things to think through. She took a deep breath, closing her eyes and letting the anxiety flow through her for a moment. She hadn't really let herself think about this idea, not until she was sitting on the roof. Star needed to talk though, and this was going to be the only way Ellesandra could do so. He mug was brought up and sipped at, silently staring off across the roof tops tops before she responded. "I didn't bring you out here to do the thinking, Star." She settled with her feet placed flat on the roofing, knees up and arms partially wrapped around them, hugging them up close to her chest. The mug sat atop them while she looked anywhere but at Star, her jaw working from an obviously tense and nervous demeanor. "You obviously need to talk about something. You're afraid that it'll cause an argument, or you'll get shut down by me. But this helps me, so let's talk. What's on your mind?" It might not be Ellesandra throwing the door open for Star to come in, but at the very least, the window was cracked.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was surprised by the answer. But she smiled. It made sense, now. It was good, actually. Comforting, more than words could be, to see Ellesandra actually caring about their own emotions to some degree. Even if it was just seeking a little comfort for themselves. She looked up at the sky when the question was turned to her. "...More than you could possibly know. More than you'll be comfortable talking about, that's for sure," she said, though it was with an easy tone. One that accepted the reality, while still being happy for this chance. "...What you said at breakfast bothers me more than anything. More than you could have ever thought it would, I'd wager, else you wouldn't have said it. That you think of your wounds as mistakes, to start. I'm sure you could take a hardline thought to it and say that every single time you are wounded is somehow a mistake, somehow your fault, but to think that requires the belief that you're somehow possessed by wisdom and intelligence enough to perfectly predict every situation and every attack at all times, all the time. A mistake has to be reasonable in the moment, not just in hindsight. People don't often make mistakes intentionally, after all. It's why they're called mistakes." She paused here to sip her cocoa. "...But it's not like I'm upset at you because of poor grammar or something, this isn't some...Literary lecture." A smile, as she looked at her cocoa again. "It upsets me for two reasons. First being that if you were to tell me you're not giving it your all, that you're keeping a cool head and doing all you can to come out on top of the fights you get into, I'd be tempted to slap you for lying to both of us. The bravery I've seen you hold, the fearlessness, it's second to none. Not that you're impervious, I'm sure. But it's inspiring how you give it your all." Another pause. "...I'm not dumb though. It's not like I can't...Piece together some of the things you've said, connect some dots. Figure out with the insights that I have that the guilt you definitely don't feel because it doesn't exist and the frustrations you express about mistakes, how you clearly view it as some failing on your part, the handkerchief you aren't carrying around, and the thing you didn't blurt out to me when we got emotional back in Morrun's place...I don't know anything for sure, but it certainly gives me a few things to guess about what didn't happen, because nothing happened." Another pause for sipping her cocoa. "And because it all ties together, because this isn't about one single thing, but just how one word was the straw that broke the camel's back and put it all into context...That's why I thought it better to just not talk about it. I don't...Want to upset you. And if it requires me being upset so you don't have to be, well...That's kinda where it leads into my second point." Though what that second point was, she clearly was leaving until after Ellesandra had a chance to respond. Or not respond. "Just gonna throw out there that I recognize that was...A lot, all at once. And also gonna throw out that you asked for it," she said, smiling softly.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't answer while Star laid out all of her thoughts. About the comment from this morning, about how she'd connected it with the other things Ellesandra had said. Honestly, Ellesandra had assumed Star had made some of these connections even prior to that comment, but if that's what had made her close up, to get so introspective, then maybe Ellesandra was right in not sharing what had happened. Star didn't even know the entirety of it, and was just guessing at it. The anxiety mixed into some of the guilt that still existed as Star continued, but surprisingly there wasn't the same level of grief as there had been other times Star had approached the topic. No, there was still grief and sadness, but the other night of sobbing had seemed to do a large amount in helping relieve that load. She sipped at her drink again, letting silence build once Star was done. Her fingers tightened and then loosened, then tightened again around her mug while she considered what to say. There was twice that she opened her mouth, but nothing came out and she closed it again. She instead let the night air surround her, the smell of the evening and cocoa mixed, the sound of night creatures far off in the distance on the outside of town. It was still, with most people having been in their rooms or houses, and only some generic noise coming from the Inn below them. Finally, Ellesandra spoke. "Simply because someone is trying does not mean it's not still a mistake. A controllable one, no not necessarily. But it can still be a mistake. And you're closer to the truth than you think, though I'm not sure you can tell the extent of it." It was vague, but an answer - a confirmation for Star. There was something there, and she was close to figuring out what happened. Ellesandra ran a hand through her wet hair and snagged at the ponytail, mindlessly pulling the band off and letting her long hair flow down her back instead. "There are other mistakes that are undoubtedly mistakes though. Done in fits of rage, seeking revenge; not ones that you would argue weren't mistakes. Carelessness and recklessness." The movement was subtle, but her head lightly tilted to her right arm. "And those effect everything afterwards. The consequences of them effect my fighting. So, if I get hurt and you need to take that injury from me, it's a direct consequence of a mistake." She took another sip, then turned and gave Star a look, knowing damn well Star wasn't going to just accept that as truth or an excuse not to let Star heal her. "I was serious, that if it is something that needs to be done, I'll allow it. But otherwise, I'm not comfortable with it. I -" She paused and there was, out of nowhere, a sudden spike in the grief. Her throat closed and she closed her mouth, knowing she wouldn't get another word out right then. The grief and guilt twirled for a moment while she looked away again, forcing more hot cocoa down to try to calm herself. It didn't work, not entirely, but enough that she could finish the sentence. "I deserve the injury, if I let myself get injured. Not you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star remained calm in the face of Ellesandra's response. Where she might have previously stubbornly fought back and insisted, she just...Listened. "I have confidence that I have a vague idea of what didn't happen. I've avoided saying much about it, but from the moment I saw you, the very first moment, I could infer a lot. It's my gift, after all. That under your calm demands to the pirates, there was grief and guilt. A wounded heart. It was of course not until you outright told me, in perhaps not so many words, the source of it that I could really understand. Just understand that as much as I'm gifted in seeing emotion, that gift doesn't do all the work. I've had to learn to read between the lines of the things people say. Pick up on the little head nods towards wounded arms that people show me and connect the dots. Speculate on whether a scar on someone's back is from a sword or a whip from just a single glance at it. But, circling back to the first point a little.." She paused to take another sip. "Intent is very much what differentiates a degree of a mistake. If you walk into someone's house and bump a priceless vase and knock it over and it breaks, well...That's an accident. If you show remorse, if you explain how you didn't mean for that to happen, well...It matters. It doesn't un-break the vase, but...It matters. Sure as heck makes the response from the owner of the vase less hostile than if you walked in and grabbed the vase with a big sadistic grin on your face and spiked it at your feet then stomped on the fragments. Or if you just shrugged and coldly told them to not leave vases by the doorway. Just like how fighting with your all, and despite your best efforts still getting wounded is different than intentionally standing there and letting someone hurt you because you feel like you deserve to be punished." She let those words linger for a moment. "You're right that I don't know all that happened to you. That I don't know the context. And you don't have to tell me. I won't ask. But I'll remind you that I want to know. More than my calm words can convey, I want to know. But I want to respect your boundaries more. So...That's where that ends unless you decide otherwise." Another sip. "...We can all be careless and reckless sometimes. I'm not saying we're absolved of the consequences of our failures by our good intentions. But just as I said before...There has to be some allowance for us. We are, none of us, perfect. And I'm sure if I were to turn this on you instead, you'd find every excuse to try to absolve me. Or perhaps you wouldn't. So...Let me ask you rather than assume." She looked at Ellesandra again. "...If I find my mother dead, what should I feel? I told you what happened. I told you that, in the moment, perhaps I could have taken my mother with me, or insisted she come. Perhaps that could have saved her life. By not doing so, perhaps I allowed the fear I felt to stop me from intervening in what could very well have been the moment that sealed my mother's fate. So it's a direct result of my inaction." Another pause. A softer, slightly more serious tone then came from her, then. This question was important to her, even as it was left prefaced to some degree as a trap for Ellesandra to either agree with Star and acknowledge their own hypocrisy in excusing another's actions but not their own, or condemn Star to the same grief: "Should my mother's demise weigh on my shoulders, Ellesandra?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
What was she supposed to say? As Star continued speaking, Ellesandra just sipped until her cocoa was gone, and then she sat the mug to the side. She wrapped her arms around her knees entirely now, hugging them up close to her chest, and looking out over the town. Star wasn't entirely right, not with everything she said. Ellesandra hadn't just stood there and let someone stab her because she felt like she deserved it. Though - a twinge of pain came back up as she remembered what happened after all of it. And how she had, indeed, just taken her punishment without complaint. She let out a deep breath, lowering her forehead to her knees and working to push that feeling back down, the memory of her Marigold's parents. The silence stretched again, after Star posed the question to Ellesandra. How would respond to that? Ellesandra didn't move, considering. Moments passed, and then she turned her head to look at Star. "No one 'should' feel anything. You feel what you feel. How I would respond to the situation, were I to have a mother who encouraged me to run and I did so, I am sure I would handle that differently than you did. Any feeling you have there isn't inherently wrong, nor would mine be if I were in that situation." She paused, and then turned again, resting her chin on her knees and looking out over the sea. "I can't relate to being close to a mother, Star. But if I had one, if I loved her. I would feel guilty. I would feel guilty for leaving, even if I knew it was the best move right then. Staying would have distracted her, whereas leaving gave her a fighting chance. Guilty but hopeful. If she ended up dead, I would feel grief. Sorrow. Probably anger, a lot of it. Both at her for taking that choice away from me, and whoever did it to her. And if any of those are as overwhelming as...other things I've felt, I'd deal with them the only way I could while staying sane. While moving on." She looked back to Star now, her words dropping into a whisper. "I'd pretend it didn't happen."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't looked upset by the answer. She'd been exposed enough to Ellesandra's way of things to know vaguely what to expect. "Pretend it didn't happen but punish yourself for all of it anyway, you mean," she said with a calm smile. She mirrored Ellesandra's posture with legs hugged up to her chest, though she held onto her cocoa. "And hey, looks like you're not half bad at this empathy thing too. You know what it was like for me without me having said a thing about it. Guilty, but hopeful. Grief, sorrow, and anger...I've already had a lot of that over this, but plenty more waits if I find her dead, yes. But I can't do what you do, I'm afraid. Not that I would want to. It might have worked for you to some measure, but as an expert in emotions let me tell you that all you've done is ignore a festering wound. No more can you pretend this doesn't exist than you could a necrotic foot. That is to say, you can say you pretend it doesn't hurt all you want, but you're just lying to both of us." She kept a smile as she said these words. She had accepted Ellesandra for this, even if she clearly, very obviously, disagreed. "But I find it illuminating how easily you can apply nuance and judgement to the situation when your focus of your frame of mind is me, and not you. It's not to say that I'm assuming you don't have valid reasons to feel all these feelings that you do. Of course not. Like you said...You feel what you feel." She looked at Ellesandra here, meeting their gaze. "And you're going to feel it no matter how hard you try not to. And it's sat inside you, slowly chipping away at you. Poisoning you from the inside. Leading you to conclusions you truly believe...But I know for certain you would never tolerate coming out of my mouth. Things like...How you deserve to be hurt. How you deserve the injury, not me. And I could argue with you as the night is long...That you wouldn't suffer the wound if not for you needing to protect me, that it is, pragmatically, the best choice given your resistance to regular magic and it allows me more mana to do other things that are useful on the battlefield and that by not permitting it you are directly contributing to mistakes that can lead to even worse consequences - by your own logic, of course. But as I've said...I don't want to argue. All I can do is share with you what I see, and what I feel. So...Whether you want to sit with those words and say nothing, or talk about them some more, or something else entirely...There's something a little unrelated I'd like to share with you. If you'll let me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
That didn't seem fair. The defensiveness rose, but she didn't say anything. She held her response back, pressing her lips together. There was a difference between pretending a physical ailment wasn't there and an emotional one. She also had never said she'd deserved an injury in the line of protecting Star. If she got the injury in a fight, she deserved to get it because she'd been careless. Not because of any self-punishing thing - at least not consciously. The thoughts ran through her mind, but she prevented herself from saying them. Doing so really would lead into an argument with Star, which was exactly what Star had wanted to avoid. They simply didn't agree on these topics, and Ellesandra didn't think trying to explain her side would convince Star otherwise at all. So after a few moments of sitting with those thoughts but not speaking them, she just turned to look at Star and nodded. "Go ahead." Permission to discuss whatever was unrelated that was on Star's mind with a head nod, pushing the previous conversation to the back of her mind.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took the silence for what it was. The topic drew too close to disagreements. She could see the frustration and defensiveness. Star's view on emotions was naturally a deeper one than most, and with that came a reverence for them, and what led her to liken them to physical wounds. To her, they were fundamentally similar. But rather than say anything, she extended a hand to Ellesandra. "...Not words, but...A memory. A happy one. I figured we'd get here eventually if you insisted I share what was on my mind. So I came prepared to...Hopefully share with you something sweet. Something to give us a smile for the night."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned at the idea of a memory being shared. What did Star mean? Just that she was going to talk about it? But then her eyes fell to Star's hand, extended to her, and she remembered Star mentioning she could see memories in some people. And apparently share them that way as well. There was obvious distrust and caution come up, a fear that Star would somehow be able to reverse it and see Ellesandra's own memories. Did she want her to see those? Very much not, even if sharing them would make it easier than trying to explain them. She stared at that hand for a few moments, unconsciously reaching for her empty mug and trying to take a sip. It was gone, but it was the action that helped soothe the anxiety. With a deep breath, they reached out and took Star's hand, nodding. Not that she felt like she needed to experience a sweet smiling memory from Star, but that if it would help Star feel better she would comply.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star knew there was distrust. But it only reinforced the notion that she had to ensure Ellesandra felt that this was not an invasion of their privacy, but her opening up to them more. Not that Star was really closed off. But whether she could or not turn this on Ellesandra and jump through their memories was unknown, and the knight would have to believe either she couldn't, or that she wouldn't do it. One a matter of limitation, the other a matter of trust. Time would tell. But when Ellesandra took her hand, her aura blossomed off her again. It washed over Ellesandra, bringing a sense of serenity to them. It beckoned them to ease their eyes closed. Not forced, just...Soothed towards closing their eyes to share in the memory. And the memory that followed was one of Star and her mother. The viewpoint was from beyond. Like an unseen eye peering through the veil. Star was a small child. And it would be the first view Ellesandra would get of Star's mother. White hair, though slightly less snow-white than Star's. A bit more silvery. Eyes were also a slightly greener tint of blue, in contrast with Star's vibrantly blue irises. But the familial resemblance was more than obvious. Aurora. This was Aurora Lumina. A mature woman. The motherly gaze with which she gazed at Star spoke of the family bond enough without the resemblance. Little Star was still quite young in this memory. Big, twin braids flopped behind her as she ran into what looked to be the main living area of their home. Aurora was sitting upon the couch. The house was cozy. A little rustic. The furnishing weren't royal, but they were made with care. Aurora had a book in hand, but smiled as Star ran into the room. "Hello there my little twinkle-toes," said Aurora, her words adoring and loving through and through. Star giggle. "Mommaaaaaa! Sir. Bakersman came to visit! Come see, come see!" she insisted. Aurora smiled and set their book aside, then stood to follow Star as Star tugged her mother along to another room. Star then adorably began to mantle on a chair and then up onto the counter to kneel on the counter of what looked to be the kitchen and out the circular window. The vision shifted to behind their heads to reveal that Sir. Bakersman was...A squirrel. Aurora smiled, leaning slightly down to peer out the window with her child. Then, she reached forward to unlatch the window and pull it open. Aurora's aura then blossomed off her. Aurora's aura was similar, yet different to Star's. Tighter. More purposeful. More refined. More powerful. Controlled, though it retained its ethereal wispiness to it. Aurora extended a hand out. The squirrel hopped onto Aurora's hand from the tree branch that it was perched upon, crossing the small gap to land on Aurora's hand to sit in her palm. There was a trust in the body language of the animal. Aurora then pulled the squirrel in a little to let them down on the counter. "Now stay there a moment, Sir. Bakersman. Star, why don't you entertain him for a moment? I'll get him a tasty nut for his travels," she said, earning an enthused giggle and set of nods from Star. Star then set about petting the squirrel, who seemed calm as could be as she did so. "I know you've got a lot to do, Sir. Bakersman, so it is with great uhm...Great...Res...Uhm...Great happiness that you are welcomed!" she said with a giggle and kept about petting the animal. "Momma says if I keep trying, I'll figure out how to talk to you. You two better not be discussing my birthday surprise in secret! You gotta promise you aren't telling momma all my secrets, 'cause I showed you my diary in confidence! Mhm, mhm!" As Star had her fun, Aurora did leave and indeed return with a handful of nuts from their pantry. Aurora held them out for Star. Star examined them, plucking an acorn from the mixed pile and smiled as she offered it to the squirrel, who naturally took it and then turned to skitter away with the prize. Star giggled some more, so full of childish mirth. She then took the rest of the nuts and put them by the window. "Gotta leave the window open, 'cause what if he is still hungry later? I'll leave him a little pile to come back to." Aurora chuckled. "Are we just gonna invite the whole forest into our kitchen, my little sparkle?" she asked as she picked Star up to hold in her arms. She then shut the window and latched it while holding her daughter. "It'll be good practice for your aura sense. You know what Sir. Bakersman's aura feels like. So if you feel him come around again, you let me know and we'll make sure he has all he needs, okay?" she said, earning some enthused nods from Star. The two then moved back to the living room and Aurora sat down again, setting Star on her lap. Star then moved to lay down across her mother's lap, possessed by a warm smile. Aurora gently stroked Star's head, smiling. "I love you, Star. I always will." And with those words, the dream faded to white, returning Star and Ellesandra to their night atop the inn.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was definitely a happy memory, a cheery one that she was sure Star remembered fondly when thinking of her mother. Ellesandra's own reaction to it was bittersweet. A happiness for Star, to see how happy and loved she'd been by her mother, but there was also...envy. Disappointment. A feeling of missing out on these types of moments herself. It wasn't that she'd not had anyone to care for her as a kid, once she was taken in, but those who were her guardian's weren't...parents. At least not hers. They supported her, encouraged her to get better and find a career, but love her? Nothing like this. So while she pulled away from the memory, smiling softly to Star but pulling her hand away before any of her own memories that had come to the surface could flow back into Star, her own memory of the last time she'd seen the one who might be considered the closest thing to Ellesandra's mother came through her. There was shame, mostly of herself, and she pushed the memory away before she could relive too much of it. Before Star would feel bad for sharing such a pleasant memory of her mother, or see the reactions Ellesandra would certainly have to her own memory. "She obviously loved you. What ever became of Sir Bakersman? Did he come back and get more nuts?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see it. Despite not seeing the memory, she could still see Ellesandra's emotions. She knew this was possible. That she'd be, to some degree, shoving Ellesandra's face in how close she was with her mother. Not the intent in the slightest, no. But she was sympathetic all the same. She wore that sympathy in her eyes as she looked at her companion. She hugged her legs, leaning her head on them, turned towards Ellesandra. She smiled. "He did. Paw-paw'd at the window since they were right there in sight. I didn't sense him coming that day, but I got better at it. I just wanted to share that with you...Because now you know what she looks like. What she sounds like. And...Maybe gives you a bit of a better understanding of why it's so important to me that I do what I do. I know that...things weren't so easy for you. I remember you told me you were an orphan. You probably didn't need a reason or any reinforcement about what this means to me but...I hope you enjoyed it at least half as much as I do thinking back on it." She was a little misty-eyed, though it wasn't as easy to spot in the moonlight. "I won't bridge off that to talk about you, much as I do want to know more about your childhood and past and...The people you've cared about through the years. I just wanted to share that sliver of my happiness with you tonight." She sniffled. "I really love her, too. I really miss her."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She smiled at the idea of a squirrel pawing at a window to be let in to get nuts. As well as a child Star excitedly looking out for him to come pet him and feed him. A nod was given in regards to the information about her mother, turning back away from Star and staring out into the night once more. She was silent, not knowing how to respond as Star brought up her childhood, even if she reinforced that it wasn't intended as a bridge to talk about Ellesandra. The sniffling got to her, a weakness in seeing someone cry, to where Ellesandra scooted closer to Star and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. There were no words - what was she going to say, 'yeah I know you love her and miss her'? What benefit would that have? Instead, if Star accepted that touch, she'd continue looking out into the sea that could be seen across the horizon, the ships that were in dock right now. Her mind flitted through different things in her childhood, before things had gone wrong and soured her view of it all. There were few things she could think about or share without Marigold being involved, since Marigold had been such a large part of her life for essentially all of Ellesandra's memory, but eventually she did think of one that she thought could be shared. "After I was found, outside a burned down building that they assume my parents had died in, I was taken in by a very well to do family." She started off, chewing on her lip and intentionally keeping things very vague. She didn't want to go into too much detail about any of it, since it would beg questions. Keeping it vague felt like an obvious boundary. "Well to do enough that they had a personal swords trainer on staff, and I remember sitting on a bale of hay in the training grounds. I must have been - five, six? And this woman, I've never admired someone so. She was an Acolyte of Torm, having left his temples to serve the family of her partner. Best fighter I've ever seen, even to this day. I don't think I ever, even as I came into my own in training, landed a blow she didn't intentionally leave open to test my awareness. Black and grey, salt and pepper colored short cut hair, for a while in my teens I tried to emulate her with the short hair because my admiration had turned into a little bit of hero worship and attraction for your teacher, situation. Didn't really fit me, though." She reached up, running a finger through her hair briefly. Her own round face didn't fit the style of a short cut military style; her face was too 'cute', and not quite as sharp or strong as her teacher's had been. "I don't remember a mother, not like the mother you had. Those who took me in provided a purpose, a shelter and food, but they weren't parents." She said this with a shrug. That part had never bothered her; she'd never sought that type of affection from them. Well, it hadn't until the last few days she'd seen them. She hadn't realized just how little they'd thought of her. The shame came back, but she forced it down again. "So her, she would probably be the closest thing I have to a mom, a mom like yours anyways." A snort came out of nowhere. "Not that she'd ever deign to let me lay my head in her lap. She would have slapped my ass and told me if I had time to lay against her I had time to work on my stance. But it was always done with the goal of improvement because she wanted to ensure I could protect myself. A genuine caring, in her own way."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was once more a little surprised, but not unpleasantly so, to have Ellesandra scoot over and loop an arm around her. It brought a smile to her lips. She might sniffle, but her face wrote how touched she was all across her features. It was a small gesture, but an important one for Star. Physical touch was important to her. A manifestation of a bond between two people. She leaned into the touch, into the hold. Not a peep was heard from the empath while Ellesandra spoke. Just a series of warm smiles that brightened across her lips at various points in the story. There was some darkness on her features at the notion that Ellesandra had caretakers, not parents. A parent didn't need to be blood. But it sounded like love was a scarce resource in Ellesandra's home. All that did was quietly give Star resolve to ensure that Ellesandra felt her care as their friend. More so when seeing the shame rising in Ellesandra. She didn't comment, but it remained tucked away with the many insights she had about the woman that she held in her heart with the hope of someday, somehow, giving Ellesandra something to smile about. A smile so wide and so genuine that it brought them to tears. Yes. That was a fine dream to hold onto. Something that only reinforced her desire, her drive, to keep Ellesandra close. They might be her guardian for now...But no matter what fate had in store for them, she wanted to ensure beyond all doubt that she and Ellesandra would never forget one another, and smile when they thought of one another. "Everyone shows love in different ways," she said quietly, smiling. "I like hearing about people who made you smile. About people who cared about you." She left out her thoughts on the matter that the knight sounded to be severely lacking in people like that in their life. "She raised a fine knight. Finer than any I've ever met, certainly. And I have indeed met my share."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't really look at Star much during her story, so she wasn't seeing how her smile spread at different parts of her story. The idea of telling Star about people who made her smile though brought back memories of the only one who had done so consistently, and that just sent a shock of pain through her system. She did make a dismissive, disagreeing hum at the fine knight comment as well, trying to play off the pain she was sure Star had seen briefly as disagreement about whether she was a fine knight. Ellesandra was certain that her old mentor would be ashamed to claim her as a student. She hadn't seen her mentor after the incident and before she left, but Ellesandra knew - or at least she thought she did. In reality, she'd have been welcomed with open arms if she'd gone to her mentor, but Ellesandra had not been in a mental state to believe or do that. She still wasn't. "So, there." Ellesandra said, clearing her throat of the memory of one more thing she'd lost. She once again pulled her knees up to her chest, and sidled a little bit away from Star. This time it wasn't a matter of wanting distance, but that after a moment Ellesandra laid back on the roof and spread her arms out, staring up into the night sky. "Don't expect stories like that often." She warned, not wanting this to be a precedent set where Star would expect Ellesandra to open up about things from her childhood or past.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept her posture, despite the flicker of desire to mirror Ellesandra and lay next to them. That brought a momentary...Weird feeling in her chest that was gone again before she could focus on it and put any meaning to it. So she just stayed where she was, knees held to her chest. Maybe she just needed this self-comfort. She looked up at the stars some more as well, all the same. "I don't hold any expectations. Just hopes," she said with a soft giggle under her breath. "Just for the record, I don't mind sharing. I know you're a private person. I respect that. But you don't have to treat me as you want me to treat you in this respect. I'm sure it's not the same for you but...I like to relive memories. Good, and bad. I like to share myself with the people I care about." Ellesandra was obviously the subject of this, though she kept it general to avoid pointing a spotlight on the knight. "So don't be afraid to ask, if you ever find yourself curious. If it helps your pragmatic mind, maybe you can just think of it like...Understanding the details of the mission. Fishing for clues." She giggled. "Might be something relevant in my stories that I just hadn't considered. Definitely not me making up excuses to give us more to talk about, ehe.~"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Hopes. Ellesandra had to resist rolling her eyes at this. Why would anyone hope that Ellesandra revealed more about herself? It wasn't like her past was pleasant, a good story to listen to. She wasn't one of those adventurers who would go to a tavern and tell tales of their exploits all through the realm. There was no comment though as Star extended the offer to open it up on her own side, even the implication that she cared for Ellesandra. Which was ludicrous, considering they'd only known eachother for a few days - most people didn't learn to care about anyone that quickly. Was it this resonance thing, or whatever harmony it was? She shook her head, finding herself smiling in amusement at Star's giggling and ending 'ehe'. "You don't need my permission to talk about yourself, Star." She opened her mouth, about to add 'as long as you understand it might not be reciprocated', but stopped and closed her mouth. That boundary had already been drawn, multiple times. Star knew, and shoving her face in it when Star wasn't pushing wasn't going to do any favors for them getting along. So, she closed her mouth and settled back into the roof, repositioning so that the wooden slat beneath her wasn't pressing into her shoulder uncomfortably. "Don't just randomly send me memories though, please. I'd like warning before that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled, unseen to the woman laying beside her as she kept her gaze forward and upward. "You sure do live by a strict set of rules, don't you?" she asked, perhaps rhetorically. "I'm not asking permission. I can say whatever I want, whenever I want. But just because I can talk about something, doesn't mean you want to hear it." She looked over her shoulder to smile at Ellesandra. "If you don't want to know anything about me, hear anything about me, there's not much reason for me to talk about it, is there?" Another question that seemed rhetorical, meant just to make her point than to actually demand an answer from the knight. She turned her eyes over to the water, then. "I'm not sure where you get this idea of me that I'm purposefully going to trample over every boundary between our emotional selves. Believe it or not, I care very much about preserving the privacy of peoples' emotions. Which might sound a bit strange, since I can see everyone's emotions," she said with a giggle. "But I can't help that much. What I can help is what I do with that knowledge. And of course, what I always want to do is help people. And sometimes that means putting a bold step forward, but...Most of what I see in others, I keep to myself. There's something I do with others, once in a while. I can bridge my aura to another person and temporarily let them see what I see. And if you ever did want to see the world through my eyes, you might understand a little more what I mean. The world is always alive, always brimming with colour. But I've never done that with someone I am resonant with, obviously. So better to just leave that as a...Thing to ponder for a while, maybe never to do." It wasn't like Star to shy away from something like this; she had said herself she enjoyed being open. And that she had shared this connection of her sight with others in the past. It was perhaps the first time it was Star being hesitant about sharing some part of herself, regardless of what Ellesandra thought about it. "Sorry. Rambling...I just was trying to say I'm not going to go doing what you said. I'd never want to bridge our auras without your consent. I want to respect your boundaries as much as I'm physically able to. It's just harder to do with you than it has been with anyone else. I'm sorry that that is how it is. I know it frustrates you."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra almost laughed at the rules. Rules helped her with a lot of things, helped her socially anxious ass know what was appropriate in certain situations. The rhetorical question was nonetheless answered with her shaking her head. Still, the discussion of not walking over Ellesandra's boundaries made her roll over to her side, watching Star curiously. She had a thoughtful expression on her face as she did, letting silence fill the air for a few moments after Star's comment about allowing Ellesandra to see things Star did, before she answered. "I wouldn't want to do that. It's not that I distrust you, specifically, Star in that you would intentionally bulldoze through the boundary I've tried to create, or that others do. I find your power, inherently, invasive." She took a breath, shaking her head. "I know you can't control it, and that you're doing your best to do so when we touch, but if the shadow is right that's especially hard to do with me because of whatever resonance or harmony we have together." She waved her hand, waving off the more technical explanation and just assuming Star would follow along with it. "At first, I was afraid you were going to just ignore my wish and decide that you were too curious not to. And that you'd hide behind the guise of wanting to help me because I'm in pain or something like that. I don't think that anymore, I know you wouldn't intentionally do anything like that. But your power is hard to control with me, and even if it's not your fault I don't feel comfortable with that. So when I reaffirm my boundary, know that I'm not criticizing you. It's honestly more for my benefit than anything, and I recognize that it's not something you can control when you do that. It's also why I would never want to use your power to see other's aura's like you do. I find it invasive to them even if they're open to it, and I can control it by not taking you up on the offer."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded along with the knight's explanation. "In this case, I think you're right to worry it would be difficult to maintain that boundary in such a case. And I try to realize you're not criticizing me. I try. But there's part of me that can't help but feel rejected for something I can't control." She shook her head. "That's equally not your fault. It's just completely different from what I was used to growing up. With my mother, we could hold each other any time and there was this...Unspoken way we could communicate, since we share the same gift. There's nothing as comforting to me as being able to do that with someone, even if I know it would be a lot to task of even a generally open person." Read: Not you, Ellesandra. "I obviously had to learn to have trust people at their word, read context, all of that. But as much as my gift is something I consider a blessing, it hasn't come without its struggles. It's...Hard to put into words what the anxiety can be like sometimes. I see anxieties in other people and they can be strong, yes. But it's not quite the same anxiety that I feel needing to trust in the unknown, instead of being allowed to hold someone and let our hearts connect. It's so much harder to convey how I feel to other people with words." She paused a moment. "...I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm just doing my best. And no matter how strongly I feel that that connection I can have with someone because of my gift is a beautifully special thing, it won't stop me from acknowledging that you feel the way you feel, and that your views are as they are. This whole subject just has put this...Longing in my heart. So I apologize in advance if I'm sounding a little more sentimental than usual." She then smiled and threw out a distraction before Ellesandra could properly reply to any of that, giving them an out to just move on from it all without a word: "...The stars are bright tonight. Beautifully so."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She listened, not quite sure what to say to what Star was sharing. It might not come as a surprise to anyone, but Ellesandra wasn't good at these types of conversations even at the best of times. She could tell when someone needed comfort, but she wasn't always good at giving it, as seen by the simple hug that was done awkwardly and uncomfortable occasionally. Verbal comfort? Ellesandra was bad at it. She wasn't the type to just agree with someone and vent about something, talk about boys or girls you were interested in and complain how they were dumb dumbs for not being interested in you back. With the topic change to the Stars, a thought flitted through Ellesandra's mind. Her eyes ran up and down Star's back, knowing that if Star were not a client, her charge, she would probably have made the comment that came to her. That at least one Star was particularly beautiful that night. She refrained, however. Flirting with a charge was a good way to get herself hurt again, and upset a client most likely, considering Ellesandra had no intention of opening up to a lover. And Star very much did not seem the type to be able to have a night of passion and then act like nothing happened the next day. So, without comment she turned to her back and stared up at the sky again, grunting softly in agreement. "I've looked at the stars more in the past few nights than I have in years." She commented, considering. She normally didn't bother looking up at the sky, not unless she thought there might be danger coming from it or anything.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a calm silence that overtook Star for a moment. Something pensive. Something that suggested she was retreating inwards again. Then she just shook her head for seemingly no reason, then eased back to lay down, hands folded on her middle. "There might not be answers among them...But they've always inspired me. Kinda lame, isn't it? That me, with my name, of all people, would feel that way?" A small giggle. "But it is who I am. And if there is one thing I am good at it's...Being completely, unashamedly...Me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra scrunched her face up in confusion. "Why would it be lame? Your family has history with celestial objects, apparently naming children like that. Your mother being named Aurora doesn't make it lame for her to enjoy looking at Aurora's, does it?" She shrugged, considering back to her childhood when she cared if people thought she was lame. These days, being called lame wouldn't bother her at all. Lame was safe, expected, predictable. The only part of her that she didn't want to be predictable was her fighting, or her work guarding someone. If she was too predictable there, it could get a charge in trouble or in danger. Everything else? What other people thought of it didn't matter; they couldn't think any less of her than she already did. "Did your family have any stories in regards to the stars, or things as such? I've heard some religions tend to dedicate certain constellations to their deities and attribute the creation of such to them, though I'm not sure how much I believe that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star just smiled and laughed under her breath. She didn't really have an answer as to why it was lame other than just the connection between name and object. Did one cause the other? Or was her mother just astute and felt some energy, some feeling that she would feel this way? She hoped she might be able to ask her mother someday. She still hoped they were out there. "I remember the first time she showed me an aurora, to explain what she was named after. I asked her if that was the aura of the world," she said with a giggle. "Auroras look a lot like what I see around people. Some people are more colourful than others. Everyone's aura is unique. So when I saw it in the sky, I thought it might be a glimpse about how the sky felt, and I just couldn't reach out and feel it yet. Unfortunately, that was just me being a silly little girl. As for stories? There's one." She paused a moment, recalling the story. "...My mother told me about one star in the sky, something she called the star of guiding silver and purest white. A star that shone only once every thousand years. A star that, if it hung high in the sky, could be called upon to shine down a healing light upon the one who beseeched it. The silvery white light of the star could cure the worst curses, the deepest wounds. It could comfort the greatest sadness and banish darkness wherever it shone." She paused another moment. "There was...A great, terrible war in my homeland long ago. The story goes that there was a man of the most vile hatred for life that he saw fit to exterminate everyone under the guise of a promised ascension to something greater than themselves. But being so charismatic as he was, he rallied cultists under his rule to spread across the three realms of my homeland, plunging everything into war. Each innocent slain rose again to serve under the army of the Grand Magician, Faust. A darkness that spread across the land so dark that it threatened to snuff out all life. But on one fateful night, my mother told of a story that she was passed from her mother, and to them from their mother, going back as far as anyone can remember, that one night when all seemed at its darkest, the white-silver star shone in the sky. And from the heavens descended the savior of the realms, who we know only as Silent Purity. An angel, with wings of purest alabaster, a sword that shone light bright enough to banish darkness across the plane of Sun, Moon, and Star in one glorious thrust to the sky, and a mask over their face. Never to speak a word under an oath of silence. And this is a story known all through my homeland; the scars of this war remain in some places even to this day, unless a great deal has changed since I was separated from it. But most who tell the story simply say the angel came down on just some fated night. It is only when my mother told it to me that she said Silent Purity brought with her the white-silver star from the heavens, plucking it from its home in the sky for when the land needed it most to shine amidst her golden halo as she banished the darkness. Ultimately...The story concludes not with a righteous salvation, but sacrifice. That Silent Purity held high the white-silver star, but that Faust dragged Silent Purity with him to his grave. That she saved the land, but had known from the moment she descended from the heavens she knew her fate was to die for us all. So...As you can expect, there is a fair amount of reverence for her that lived on. Statues built in her image, some who worship her. But it was all supposedly a thousand years ago or so. So I imagine the devotion these days is much less than it was in the era where the realm rebuilt itself after the catastrophe."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra listened raptly. She didn't watch Star, instead eyes gazing across the many speckles of light in the night sky, but she fully paid attention to the story. It was hard not to relate the story to those she knew as a kid, most closely to Torm himself and his sacrifice as well as the sacrifice of the thousands of mortals who supposedly gave their souls to empower Torm. And his resurrection, which she had fond memories of celebrating. They were some of the few times that she spent away from Marigold, and though she still had bitter sweet memories with her mentor during such celebrations, there were many in which Ellesandra lost herself to drink, food, and the pleasures of a night's company during them. Not as many as she would have liked, before she was fully turned away from the god. "Sometimes I wonder if all of the stories we hear about deities are really just one deity in different forms. So many of them are extremely similar to one another; are they making up stories of such because they know it works for us mortals to connect with them and believe in them more? Are they truly as similar to one another as they seem sometimes?" She shrugged, looking over to Star finally. "Silent Purity, though. Quite a name to have to live up to, with self-sacrifice. Certainly a worthy role model and someone to look up to as a child."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I don't have the answer to that. But if that's the case, this one god sure does like to fight with themselves. Bahumat and Tiamat. Selune and Shar. Lathander and Myrkul. Corellon and Lolth, and Gruumsh. Mystryl and Kozah. If you give me a few minutes to recall my lore, I'm sure I can come up with a whole lot more tales of gods who really, really don't like each other," she said with a giggle. "But, even that could be a manifestation. It's hard to...Know something." She paused again, donning another pensive expression. Something tinted slightly with sorrow. Her heart was reminded again of what it was like to connect with her mother and know the depths of the heart of the other. The longing ache returned. But she kept quiet about it. "What about you?" she asked, looking at Ellesandra again. "I would say I looked up to my mom more than Silent Purity. Did you have anyone you looked up to, besides that nameless trainer who would probably crack their whip at you for doing something so heinous as, ah...Relaxing on a rooftop instead of practicing your flourish?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She snorted at the idea of the god fighting amongst itself in different forms. "Maybe the deity is just bored so creates conflict with itself. Fighting can be fun if you've grown up with it your whole life, a sport really." She knew many a person who enjoyed the art of dueling for the enjoyment over it more than the utility and use it had in guarding or fighting for something. The comment about cracking the whip was something she had to actively force herself not to react to. The scars on her back seemed to tingle at the thought. Oh, her trainer hadn't been the one to cause them, hadn't been holding the whip, but it was too close for full comfort. Shaking her head and those thoughts out of it, she considered who she might have looked up to. Besides 'that nameless trainer.' "Her name is Sia. I only called her ma'am or ser, though." A moment of silence after as she considered who else she may have looked up to. At least, looked up to and was still comfortable talking about. "There was a soldier I served with for a time, Aeras. He was a true believer in Torm, a paladin. The most honorable man I've met; he would tell it to you straight and still make you feel grateful for him giving you brutal honesty. Truly wanted to help people in the world, and thought hiding things from them or being anything but truthful was, in the long run, more harmful than telling them the truth. I don't know how he did it, tell someone to their face they were an asshole and somehow make them thank him for being honest and never feel defensive." She shrugged lightly. "Last I heard, he'd died in battle against some beast that was prowling the beaches near the outskirts of the Kingdom. I mourned his loss, and celebrated his memory during The Divine Death ceremonies."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star noticed the reaction. Of course she hadn't intended it, but...Well, that did confirm that, didn't it? She made a mental note to not bring that up again. "Sia? That's a nice name," she said, unable to view the stern mentor with the same instilled fear, respect, or whatever kept Ellesandra in line. Sia hadn't yelled at Star to demand she call them 'ser' after all. A passing comment, before Ellesandra continued. "Paladins have that way about them. I knew a paladin before, a paladin of Arshea. She was...Eccentric. But kind." Once more, just an anecdote, not wishing to linger on herself, wishing to focus on the other instead. "I'm sorry to hear of his passing. It sounds like your homeland lost a good soul. Perhaps not the most gentle one, but I get the sense from the people you describe as looking up to, you have a lot of respect for strong personalities like yours." She smiled, truly meaning it in a good way. "I can't say I blame you of course. It's inspiring to see someone face things with fearlessness, to command others with strength of conviction." She was mostly thinking aloud with this, but focused back on the point by the end. "Have you ever been a leader to other soldiers? I can tell you're well used to being part of an organized plan with how you fit in with the elves, though with how you always spoke in common to them it makes me suspect you missed the speech that was given in elvish before we left the grove."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Sia was a nice name. For a while, Ellesandra had considered it for a child's name, if she ever had one. She no longer considered having a child as an option, though; no more dreams of settling down with someone and raising a family. She nodded at the comment about Paladins and their seeming natural charisma. She nodded softly to herself, not letting her mind stray near the only 'gentle' person she'd looked up to or truly respected. She didn't exist, after all. "Leader? Oh, no. I don't have the desire or drive to command others; the ability to command respect like that. I've never desired to be able to do so, either." She paused, reaching up to run fingers through her hair and scratch at her scalp lightly, thinking back to her early teens. "I did serve as a squire to a knight on a brief campaign. It was just to take out some bandits on the outskirts, we weren't a Kingdom at war or anything. I started squiring when I was about ten, with the goal of becoming a Knight, of course. So I have experience marching with them, travelling and how an army functions overall." That was what she'd been calling upon during the march with the elves, and her tendency to follow command when given. "As for language - no I don't speak anything but maybe one or two words in elven I've picked up during my travels. I did join a few lessons in Sylvan growing up, enough I could pass for a basic conversation, but I wouldn't be able to hold anything in depth or get nuances in it." She hadn't been particularly good at that, and did not want to delve into those particular memories. Marigold had dragged her to the lessons because she wanted someone to be able to practice with; Ellesandra's interest had always been much more in Marigold and much less in the actual Sylvan language. The memory stirred up some of the guilt and pain, but she quickly focused her mind elsewhere. Pretending it didn't exist, after all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept an eye on the way Ellesandra's emotions flashed through their explanation, as she often did. Polite eye contact was maintained all the time, though that naturally came with the obvious consequence. Star idly wondered if Ellesandra might consider it more polite if Star didn't look at them. Just...At all. Weird thought to put away. She found it odd, and her face shows as much, that Ellesandra had no desire for leadership. But with some short consideration, she surmised her own answer to why that might be. She didn't want to push it. It was nice to be on the receiving end of them opening up, even if it wasn't anything terribly personal. "I speak a lot of languages. They come pretty naturally to me, so, if you ever need a translator, I'm your girl," she said with a bright smile, not having any judgement for Ellesandra's lack of desire to learn them. Only one of them needed to speak any given language to get around, after all. "Was there anything else you had to learn in part of becoming a knight? Maybe it's a given, but I assume you're at home on horseback. But I don't really know what else you might learn outside of combat. Surely there's some other facets to it, no?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't seem to notice Star's apparent thoughts. The eye contact did make her uncomfortable, in which she usually was not meeting it just from a habit of looking away while she spoke. The 'I'm your girl' comment made Ellesandra raise a single eyebrow at Star in amusement, but she didn't comment on it. Again, there would be no flirting with Star, even when Star made comments that left her wide open for it. Turning her mind back to her training, she sat up and took her empty mug, looking down into it as something to look at rather than the eye contact Star was making. "Well, fighting is an obvious one. Being able to put armor on and take it off quickly. Riding a horse, yes, as well as driving a carriage and wagon and such. Camp making, fires, setting up tents, how to live off of the gruel they serve when out on the road." She smirked at this, thinking back to some of the particularly bad meals that were served. Stew that was more water than anything else on particularly long trips. "Keeping an eye out while being on guard, how to sleep lightly to be woken easily but still get decent sleep. Along with that learning how to fall asleep almost instantly. Sometimes, you take the nap you can get. And then one specific to myself was studying some basic medicine; since healing magic didn't work well on me, I went out of my way to learn how to tend to wounds myself if I could."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star noticed the brow raise, then looked away. Did she say something weird? Truly, she was too innocent in the matters of the heart to know what she invited. Among more flirtatious company, she was utterly out of her depth and bullied to an inch of her face's ability to hold a blush. Moving on from that, she nodded to the mostly expected answers. "I noticed the medical training. I learned much of that myself from a few different mentors over the years; healing has always been a calling for me, though there's only so much I can rely on my magic for that. And I wouldn't use my sympathetic healing on just anyone unless it was critical." Something said casually, perhaps without thinking about how it drew the natural parallel to how eager she was to use it on Ellesandra. She kept going without notice of this however. "I commend you for your iron stomach. I would sooner live off the land than even think about some of the culinary masterpieces you must have experienced in your time in service.."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The sympathetic healing comment got her to look over at Star again curiously, eyebrows raised. She didn't call Star on it, on how much Star had wanted to use it to heal Ellesandra. It could just be that Ellesandra couldn't be healed easily with normal magic, so it was the main option for her. It could also be the supposed resonance between them, but she suspected it was something different. She pursed her lips for a moment, then turned to look out over the quiet night of the town again. "I would prefer to live off the land too, but when you're travelling in large groups that's not as much of an option. Additionally, just typical rations you can buy from the store would be too expensive for a large group over month's of travel, so you take what ingredients you do have and make it stretch as far as it can go. I understand why the food was like that, even if I didn't particularly enjoy it." She began rubbing at her shins beneath her breaches, happy it was a warm night because she would have been getting cold by now otherwise.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  If the two hadn't committed to two days of rest, Star might have been more eager to get back to bed to ensure she caught up on some lost sleep from recent days. But for all she cared she could sleep until four in the afternoon the next day if it meant she could stay up and have a moment that meant something with Ellesandra. Assuming the knight was true to their word and didn't feel the whole thing to be in jest, the two were to be together for at least a whole year. Not that Star gave a damn about the formality of 'hiring' Ellesandra, which was just a front to try and give them some money. Not that she'd admit as much freely. The knight was free to go any time as far as she was concerned but...She did want them to stay. She did notice the rubbing though. "You're not cold, are you?" she asked with idle concern. "We don't have to stay up here. Though I...Need to thank you for taking me up here. I feel better than I did...I hope you are having a good time here with me, too."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shook her head. "Oh no, I was just thinking it is nice that it is a warm night. Otherwise I might have been getting cold." She did look sideways at Star curiously though. 'a good time here with me, too.' Was Star flirting with HER? She eyed Star curiously for a moment, then shook her head and turned back out to watch the sea in the distance. "Well, I think I've done what I set out to do here. You wanted to know some more about me, I think that's three different stories of my past I've shared?" Oh, none of them even came close to touching the mountain that Star was actually curious about, but the empath would just have to take what she could get. This was more than Ellesandra had shared with someone for a long time, since the incident actually. "Glad it helped you feel better."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a smile at those words, nodding and glad to hear the knight wasn't cold or uncomfortable. "I like knowing more about you. Even the small things," she said, then giggled. "Hey, what's your favourite colour?" A silly question on the surface, but...Ellesandra had certainly seen how much importance colour had to Star and her powers. The swath of colours that surrounded her when she meditated demonstrated as much. "Mine is blue. Azure, actually. Like the sky."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Favorite color? She hadn't considered a favorite color in years. She was thoughtful for a moment, looking up at the dark, starry sky as if she could see the blue azure in it that Star had mentioned. Closing her eyes, she knew the answer she would have said just three years ago. It was no longer the same answer, though. The brief pang of loss only happened for a moment before she was considering a new answer to the question. Eventually, she reached up and ran a finger across the center of her own chest, where her armor would have been if she'd been wearing it. "Silver. I consider the sight of silver hopeful. Seeing armor and swords around me, the dull greys and the brighter, polished silvers all blending together. Torm's gauntlet on his symbol, I'm sure a lot of people might look at something like that and have fear if they've been on the receiving end of people who use weapons and armor to oppress or hurt. But I like the glossyness of it. The sun reflecting off of a breastplate, and.." She paused, reaching up and running a hand through her hair. Unnaturally silver, for someone so young. She'd had it ever since she could remember. "I've grown to enjoy my hair color. Makes me stand out, which is unfortunate, but also something I wouldn't give up."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled at the response. She was obviously happy with it. It meant more to Ellesandra than just 'I like it', namely. There was depth to the emotion. And Star was all about depth to emotion. It was strangely uplifting, enough to brighten her smile significantly. Though it might not be clear to Ellesandra, it was, to Star, an insight into the core of the woman. The place she cared most about. Indeed, it wasn't the actual answer that mattered, but more how much thought and meaning was behind the answer that had Star looking genuinely brightened. "You do have a nice hair colour. It's...Hm." She looked at Ellesandra's hair for a time, deciding how best to describe it. "...Well. I don't think you'd agree with what I think about it. But it's nice. It suits you. Brings out eyes quite well and compliments your complexion, and looks dashing in the ponytail you wear. Though, as close as it is, I prefer it when you have it down." There she went, light-heartedly going on about Ellesandra's beauty without a single moment of inhibition.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't sure why her answer had made Star so happy. She narrowed her eyes in confusion at the woman beside her, tilting her head to the side. Why did that matter so? Did her own aura have a lot of silver in it or something, that would explain the color choice? The curiosity to see her own aura rose, but she pushed it down. She knew she'd see something there that she did not want to see, and as much as she might pretend it wasn't there, she knew in the back of her mind it was. The weird comment about her hair made her tilt her head to the side and pull it over her shoulder, looking down at it. Was there something wrong with it? Then the casual comment on how dashing she looked made her snort. Star was so innocent and naïve she didn't even realize what she was saying could be interpreted as flirting. Another reason that Ellesandra shouldn't try anything with her; Star had indicated previously that she'd never been intimate with someone, after all. Ellesandra wasn't about to take advantage of that. "Well, even if I don't agree what you think about it, I'd love to hear it. Other than your flattering me there, which I don't think you meant as part of that statement since I've done nothing to imply I think I look less than dashing." Ellesandra knew she would be considered beautiful to some. She was fit, athletic, and had one of those rounder faces that many considered adorable. She hated her face shape a lot of the time, but it had it's benefits.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star giggled. "I'm not afraid of flattering you. There's plenty to flatter. But if you want to know what I truly think of it? When I think of seeing your hair blowing gently in the breeze while standing with the sun rising behind you, the only thing that comes to my mind to describe it is...Heroic." She redoubled her smile at that. Even if Ellesandra disagreed, it was how she felt. "Glad we can at least agree on how dashing you are, if nothing else, ehe.~"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra paused, turning to stare at Star and her giggling - flirting. Well, it might not actually be flirting, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. Confusion clouded her as she watched the mage next to her, eyes squinted and trying to determine her game. Was it just naivety and she was saying things she thought were true, but not with a goal behind it? That was most likely, but Ellesandra was doubting how true it was. After a moment, she decided to go with that anyways. Even if Star was actually flirting with Ellesandra, it was a bad idea to pursue anything there. Best to assume platonic and keep acting that way. Turning, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Heroic." She muttered, considering Star's image of her like that. "You're wrong." She reached up, rubbing at the base of her neck and staring into the night sky. She used to think she'd be heroic, some strong lady knight who would save the world. That was what she daydreamed about as a kid, even as a young teenager. She had no such fantasies any more. This was a job, the only thing she knew how to do and was good at. It was no longer a life long dream, but simply a way to survive. Taking a deep breath, she slapped her hands onto her thighs and then moved to stand, planning to effectively end their night out on the roof. "Well, I think I'm going to head in to bed. I'd feel more comfortable if you did as well, not just staying out on this roof where some shadow or pirate could assassinate you. Are you ready?" It was an obvious brush off from the topic of heroicism, and a potentially forced end to what Star might be considering a pleasant evening, but Ellesandra simply didn't have it in her to talk about herself any more. She was already stretched more than she had in a long time, telling the stories she had.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wore a smile even in the face of Ellesandra telling her she was wrong. "I did tell you that you wouldn't agree with me," she said, not fazed by the brick walls Ellesandra was busy laying mortar to build around herself again. She could see the complicated emotions that surrounded the notion swirling around on Ellesandra's aura. A hint of hopefulness at the word smothered by crushing waves of the usual other emotions. It wasn't difficult to understand; Ellesandra had shared at least the surface of what she assumed was the primary source of her pain. The life of growing up an orphan had given her a new nuanced understanding after this night. The envy. Seeing how much her own mother loved her had inspired it in Ellesandra enough to paint the picture that perhaps Sia wasn't the only one who was hard on the woman. It certainly explained why Ellesandra was so rigid. As if a whip would crack if she stepped even an inch out of line. And that, too, could very much be true. The mention of whips offhand had evoked a jolt from the knight's heart. What Star saw briefly...She might be brought to anger, if not for wanting to maintain a smile for Ellesandra. Her anger for the knight's past was there, no mistaking it. But it had its time. It had its place. This wasn't either. It was left to sit and bide its time, ready to one day showcase the rare side of Star. The angry one. The one that was capable of breaching her goals of pacifism to unleash her torrent of anger in admonishment of those who had wronged Ellesandra in her eyes. Perhaps an anger that would never have its outlet. Yet it remained true that she would not allow these wrongs to go without a proper verbal lashing given the opportunity. All of this was sequestered away, out of sight, out of her heart. It had no business souring this evening. "And while I don't expect if I elected to stay that I'd catch an arrow for my troubles, it's a good time to retire to bed all the same I think." One more smile before taking her empty mug again to be returned at some point. Then, she joined the knight back to their room so they could get a good night's rest.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star had, of course, been right. Ellesandra found that she usually was when it came to emotions, even if she didn't want to admit it. Glad that Star agreed to head inside as well, Ellesandra would take the mugs down to the innkeep to be washed with a polite thanks for allowing them up on the roof, then headed back up to their bedroom to go about getting ready for bed. She was already out of her armor, but her rapier was removed from her waist and laid against the wall right next to her bed. She didn't say much to Star, but instead slid under the covers and then turned her back to the other's bed. She hoped she wouldn't have one of the dreams which made her make noise in her sleep; usually when she did she woke up due to sleeping lightly, but even still. With most clients, they would listen when she shrugged it off and said she had a bad dream. She was pretty certain that Star would be able to see through it, see it as the ptsd flashbacks they were and push on that. And so, it was with this thought in her mind to push those previous dreams back that she let herself drift off to sleep.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star fell asleep facing Ellesandra, rather than with her back turned to them. She always did, when Ellesandra was near. Perhaps something to do with being able to see the other, reassure herself if needed with what she saw. An answer that could not be known without asking directly. But it all aside, Ellesandra was pulled into slumber deeper than their usual degree. A pull that was familiar by this point, one that forcibly dragged Ellesandra into those meetings with the shadow, where the waking world was lost to them. Except this time, Ellesandra found themselves standing on an immaterial black void. Lucidity possessed them. Aware of their dreaming state, able to think and act as they would in the waking world. They were clad in the same clothing they wore while sleeping. And within this void, there were three simple choices laid out before them. Two doors, and the boundary of the dark void. One door was black, with shadowy essence seeping through the gaps between the door and its frame. The other door was white with a golden handle with soft light shimmering from behind the door. The shadow, or the white ghost. A choice. And if neither was desired, Ellesandra could feel the soft embrace of surrendering their lucidity was just beyond the border of the dark void. A short walk, ignoring the doors, and regular dreams, perhaps infused with the flashbacks that plagued Ellesandra, were waiting if they were so chosen.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hated the feel of that pull. When she came to in this strange void like area, eyes darting around and taking in the two doors, and the temptation of regular dreams down the side path she cursed. "For fucks sake!" She spun, taking in all options around her and what it was like. Part of her wanted to just sit and waste the time of whatever was behind each door. What if she did that? That is, in fact, what she did. Instead of moving off to where she could feel the soft embrace of normal dreams, she moved to where she was just in front of the two doors, standing about as close to inbetween or in the middle of them as she could, and just plopping down on the ground, criss cross apple sauce. She leaned back, palms behind her on whatever served as 'ground' here, and stared at the doors. "If you want to come and fuck around with my consciousness and decisions, the least you can do is both come out of the damn holes you're in and have a group chat here. Maybe I can watch you kill one another, that'd be a fun dream. " Ellesandra was irritated at the constant invasion into her conscious. Star did it, though in her defense it wasn't intentional, but it was still an invasion to Ellesandra. And now she had two different beings doing it, not just the shadow? She didn't care if this white and gold, supposedly 'positive' and 'heroic' vibe was actually good or not. Even if they opposed this shadow, they were still trying to use Ellesandra like some pawn in their games, and she didn't appreciate that.
</p>

  Perhaps to Ellesandra's surprise, the doors each opened at the same time, slowly, at their words. Through the black door stepped the shadow. Through the white door, the white figure, though the white figure lacked the shimmering blue spot that it had the last time it had been seen. The black and white apparitions stared one another down for a moment, though how Ellesandra knew that when the apparitions did not have eyes was a curious notion. "As you wish," said the ever-enigmatic shadow. "Though I'm afraid you won't get the deathmatch you wish for."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh shit, Ellesandra had NOT expected them to take her up on her challenge. She stood up quickly, ankles rolling smoothly to stand up in one smooth motion and taking a few steps back to ensure there was enough distance neither being could lash out at her without her having an opportunity to defend herself. Yeah sure, Ellesandra probably had no chance going up against either of them, especially without her armor or weapon, but that didn't mean she was going to be reckless in her positioning. Her arms crossed and after the moment of surprise in which her eyes had widened, she looked between the two with a frown. "That's lovely. Deathmatch would be preferred, but instead why don't you two introduce yourselves? Or shall I call you shadow bastard and light bitch? Or maybe it's shadow bitch and light bastard? Whichever you all prefer." It had been a long time since Ellesandra had actually let her ire get this evident and been petty with names - probably since she was a teen. Yet she couldn't help herself; she held her irritation with Star's invasion of her emotional boundaries back due to recognizing it not being her fault, but these beings were fully in control of whether or not they stepped in on Ellesandra's consciousness like this. And Ellesandra was not a fan of powerful beings, deities or not, playing around with her or anyone else. After what happened to Aeras and how she had been told Torm had intended that for him, else would have protected him, she had said fuck you to all beings of power like such.

  "Until such time that your decision is cemented with action, there's no purpose in revealing ourselves," said the shadow. The white apparition paused a moment, then spoke in a refreshingly feminine voice, not veiled like the shadow. "Sapphire Trisfina," said the white being. "My name is Sapphire. I know you are wary of us. Both of us. I do not blame nor begrudge you for this. But I felt it only appropriate that if...They..." she said, gesturing softly towards the shadow. "Are going to address you in your dreams, and speak of my deeds, it only is fair that I stand to represent myself. But it is my belief that our influence ought not be forced upon you. So at any time, you may walk away, beyond the boundry, to find sleep again. I have asked...them...To only ever offer you passage to speak to them, but I cannot stop them from forcibly pulling you into a shared meeting if they will it." At least this time, it seemed the shadow was playing by the rules. If there was any reaction to Sapphire introducing themselves, the shadow didn't show it. Not that it had a 'face' to speak of to examine. Just a blank slate of shadow on its head.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra rolled her eyes at the shadow, but then turned to look at Sapphire as she introduced herself. An eyebrow raised at the mention of the shadow being they, and the rules she had set upon them. Looking back to the shadow, she glanced past it to the doors, then back to the two beings in front of her. "Sapphire, huh? So are you one of their little gem creations, emerald and ruby and all, that just decided to work against them or something? Or is that name just entirely coincidental?" The doubt dripped from her voice. She was now even more convinced that the shadow was just creating this fake 'light' force to manipulate Ellesandra with. Her lips pressed together in distaste at the idea, or at the idea of falling for it anyways.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "While I can't speak for them...I'd wager it was me that inspired them, not the other way around. I assure you, I am no creation. Born human, same as you, before eventually becoming what I am today," said Sapphire. The shadow responded: "The names of my thralls are from the gems seated inside them. And if Sapphire has introduced herself, then...Call me...Black Diamond."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Black diamond? Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at them, a little amused by that, but not commenting further on it. She could just spend this whole 'dream' poking fun at both of them and annoying them, or trying to, for invading her dreams but that wouldn't be very productive. If she wanted them to leave her alone, best to let them say what they wanted to say then tell them to shove off and deny participating in their little game. So instead, she nodded. "Okay, Black Diamond and Sapphire. Sapphire has the prettier name, sorry Blackey. No, Di - yeah, Die is the right nickname for you. Sapphy? no, Sapphic. So Die and Sapphic, what I get is that Die here wants me to leave Star alone so she doesn't continue her mission or gives up, whereas Sapphic here wants me to stay with Star and protect her during her mission. Not sure if your goal is to actually ensure she dies in it by keeping her on it, or protect her to help her complete it. What's the real reason you give a damn about this though?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There would be no reactions from either as the nickname convention rolled into town. They each acknowledged, somehow, the names they had been given. "It is my desire to see Star safe, healthy, happy, and reunited with Aurora. It was a tragedy that they were ever separated," said Sapphire. "Whether you stay to protect her or not, it remains my goal. If not you, then perhaps another," she continued, earning a response from Black Diamond: "And on and on and on in a relentless and futile pursuit. Sapphire could not stop Star's last guardian from perishing. So too will be your fate, Ellesandra." Sapphire did not respond to that, instead focusing on the question once more. "I need no reason to want to see someone happy and reunited with those that love them. But if that is not enough, it is true that the Lumina family holds a gift of great import. Their auramancy can only pass through the bonds of love; all those in the Lumina family have been paragons for peace. Aurora herself can, and indeed has, stand before an army and through words alone achieve a lowering of arms, a peaceful end to conflicts that never were given a chance to begin. Star is destined to achieve the same greatness in her years to come. Thousands upon thousands of lives may yet be saved by her, so it is worth a great deal to shield her. Can you not see it, too, Ellesandra? Do you not see the purity, the kindness of which I speak? The strength that exists within her to stop bloodshed between the most bitter of enemies before it could ever manifest, and to strike down evils of this and all worlds she travels," said Sapphire, her voice filled with hope and belief in Star. "All in service of continued, perpetual suffering," responded the shadow. "A slave. A puppet for the gods to do with as they please. Protected only for their usefulness. Speaking of defending life in one paragraph, only to justify murder the next. Nothing but pandering to soft hearts for their own ends. Arbitrary lines drawn to determine when they can send Sapphire to guard someone and when it is but the will of fate, or some other absurdity they get away with only because none challenge them." The shadow didn't really have emotion in their voice, and yet...It somehow still conveyed a sense of annoyance as it responded in kind to Sapphire.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked between the two, listening to Sapphic's comments about Star and Aurora. That was additional proof that Aurora was alive; Star would be interested in hearing that. And apparently Sapphic was some sort of guard for the gods, to protect someone for them? Die was apparently going that route, trying to lean on Ellesandra's hatred of how deities used people to further their own ends, but she shook her head at them, anger rising as they tried to take a moral highground to the deities. "While I agree with you the gods deserve to be challenged and put in their place, Die, you've lost any respect for morality when your own creation and protected puppet had his pirates capture Lissana. They were going to rape her, maybe they even did before we got there, I didn't want to press on that question. And then likely kill her, not to mention what I overheard them talking about when they found Star that first time. Your mission might be good, but your means aren't, and for that alone you can shove off. I may not follow Torm anymore, but I still believe in honor and integrity in one's mission. So take your door away from these dreams and don't approach me again." Her attention turned towards Sapphire, then. "Whether I tell them to shove off while protecting Star though, is not your decision. I've agreed to guard her for one year, that is the deal we have currently. I maintain full autonomy to tell her to shove off as well at the end of that year and abandon her wherever she is in her search at that time, if she has not completed it by then. I won't be your god's puppet, either."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Bold that you think you have any bargaining chips in this matter," responded Black Diamond. "You're still neutral to me in this. But rest assured, if you act in defiance of my warnings, it won't be you I kill." That ominous threat had somewhat obvious target behind it, though it remained spoken with cold neutrality. Sapphire spoke next: "Never was it that I or anyone else made you a puppet, Ellesandra. Black Diamond would have you believe I manipulated you, pulled the strings of everything behind the scenes to manufacture events. It is not so. That I had a hand in matters is true, yes. I had known of Black Diamond's presence in Cloverport, and I had known what information might lead Star and, at the time, Nina there. Nina was unfortunately assailed. But I knew Star would press given the chance. So it was. I ensured that Morrun was given a second wind of energy on the fateful night he observed those from Myst, where he might have otherwise returned to sleep. Thus, he had energy to continue what he wished to do. It led to his observation. Then, his excited words reached the mutual contact which had sent Star to meet him. I had hoped he would have chosen to meet at the grove, as it was safer, but such was not to be. Star then went to Cloverport. And when Black Diamond saw this, they saw fit to pull the strings more directly with the intent of scaring Star away. Then you showed up. Black Diamond would have you believe I aim to intervene in everything...But truly, I want nothing more than for each to live their own lives, happily, and in peace. It is they who pull strings directly and speaks in half-truths to sway others." Words from Sapphire which could not go without answer from Black Diamond, of course: "Decrying me a purveyor of half-truths while speaking a half-truth themselves; they have known of your resonance with Star from the moment you were both born and has been plotting you both meet from that very moment. She will not admit an iota of this truth, how if you were not born with such resonance surely she would have intervened and saved Marigold to spare you the suffering you now bear. She will insist it is a matter of non-interference, but could you truly believe someone who stood by and watched Marigold sacrifice herself for you, and stood idle? Just like all the other gods and goddesses of the multiverse. Action only when it suits them. You say my methods and means have become devoid of morality, yet opposing me are those who enforce their own selective morality and wield all the power necessary to enforce it only to dismiss any attempt to judge them or demand better of by hiding behind their age and power as reason to submit and be subservient. Such is my path; words have failed. Peace...Has failed. So it is war, for if none of them will listen to understand how much this and all worlds bleed, how much they all SUFFER...Then the only option left is to show them how much the world can suffer. Let them see it with their own eyes and hearts until they decide it is time to rise off their laurels and act against the evil of the world. Because it is entirely apparent that the current degree of evil, of suffering, is acceptable. So it falls to me to become the paragon of suffering, of sorrows, to force their hand to try and stop me. And if they will not stop me, I will slay all of them. I will become the god-killer and end their reign. And you are but a wandering knight who has stumbled into this war; I will not be told otherwise that my intervention to advise you to leave is a mercy. For if you stand against me, you invite the same suffering unto yourself that will make what you now feel be, when juxtaposed, utter paradise made manifest."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She had rolled her eyes at Die's attempt to threaten her, or Star, simply looking over to Sapphic as she spoke instead. That was when Die responded, and threw Marigold into the mix. Ellesandra's mood shifted immediately. Even without Star's power, the change was noticeable. Previously she'd been annoyed, irritated and frustrated at the both of them, though her dislike of Black Diamond had obviously been more than directed at Sapphire. After commenting about how Sapphire had simply stood by while Marigold died for Ellesandra so that she would eventually be able to meet Star and protect her? It took every ounce of rational thought she had left not to swing on Black Diamond. She rarely took to violence out of anger, usually just using the anger to simmer and fuel her in training or something like that. She had never started a drunken fight, though she'd definitely finished them before. The only time her anger had completely overwhelmed her to where she physically lashed out at someone was after Marigold's death, and her body took on the scars from that encounter. No, it was with the training Sia had given her to control herself and not attack someone rashly that she held back, but her demeanor went from annoyed and trying to annoy both of these beings back for being a pain in her ass, to outright fury. She didn't respond at first, glaring at Black Diamond, but then turning her eyes to glare at Sapphire too. Her mouth opened, then closed. She didn't even have words to express her anger; they would simply seem like the petty response of a mortal to these two, most likely. Instead, she turned and began walking off into the void. Sapphire could go fuck herself for all Ellesandra cared, she wouldn't intentionally go out of her way to help Sapphire's goals unless they were the same goals Ellesandra had on her own. Black Diamond, though? She would go out of her way to destroy any shadow of theirs she saw in their travels; and she had no doubt that Star would be willing to go along with that, considering the things they were capable of. If the option still existed of walking out of this forced dream and into her normal dreams, she was now taking it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Silence reigned from the two figures as Ellesandra stormed off. Neither stopped her. Neither said another word. The void of regular dreams soon consumed Ellesandra's consciousness. Lucidity left them. But there would be no time to dream left. Morning was upon them both, and Ellesandra would wake to see Star kneeling beside Ellesandra's bed with her hands holding onto the edge, eyes poking out just over her knuckles. Like a cat, she was just observing Ellesandra with curiosity and, indeed, concern. She wanted to touch Ellesandra, but she knew they didn't like that. How long was she just sitting there watching?
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra woke up quickly, eyes opening up and quickly scanning the room. Her first goal had been to ensure neither Die or Sapphic were somehow in the room with them, but then she saw Star first thing, just peeking over her bed and staring at her. The fury was still there, covering the pain and guilt that she hadn't even noticed while in the dream, but had come up at the mention of Marigold sacrificing herself for Ellesandra. She wasn't quite sure what to make of Star crouching next to her bed and staring at her like this, her eyes furrowing and jaw clenching, trying to work the fury out of herself so it wouldn't be directed at Star. Sure, Star could see it, but it didn't mean she had to deal with it. Instead of asking the obvious about why Star was there, Ellesandra rolled over to the other side of the bed to sit up and throw her legs over it, her back her companion. "Not talking about it." She didn't know if she had been speaking out loud during the dream, so maybe Star had heard some of what she'd said, or if it was just Star seeing the fury that had built up and the irritation that had been there throughout the night. Was the fury strong enough that it had covered up the pain and grief? She was trying to push that down too, not sure how sensitive or focused Star's sight could be on emotions like that. Instead, she tried to focus on the day; it was another rest day, something she was reminded of due to her muscles. They were not nearly as bad as they were yesterday, or right after killing the captain, but they were still sore. "Breakfast?" A topic redirect, to try to distract Star - as useless as that would be.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I assumed as much," came Star's reply. She rose up and took a seat on the edge of Ellesandra's bed at those words though, looking over her companion with sincere and deep concern. "...Can you at least promise me that you're okay?" Obviously Star could see that Ellesandra wasn't. But Star had come to recognize that Ellesandra tended to prefer it when she acknowledged the knight's strength. Recalling when Star herself had pushed herself beyond her ability to walk and Ellesandra allowed some amount of pride in the matter from her. Some amount of her refusal so long as she was able to keep walking. Of course, she knew that giving Ellesandra an out to not talking about things was going to be taken. But more importantly, Star wanted to know if that went far enough that Ellesandra would lie to her. She would be able to see the telltale flush of emotions that preceded a lie, subtle in some, obvious in others. Or even if it was just a dismissive, angry retort. She'd see that, too. "Then breakfast, yes."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't look at Star, even as Star asked to promise about being okay. She didn't answer, back to her for a few moments before standing up and going to grab her rapier, strapping it to her waist. It looked like she might not answer, though her emotions went through all the thoughts of whether or not she would lie to Star, or brush her off, or how she was going to respond. The fury was still there, and after a few moments she motioned for Star. "We can chat over food." Well, that wasn't a brush off, but it also wasn't an answer. Ellesandra was not going to tell Star why she furious, she would not go into that, but she would explain what happened with Black Diamond and Sapphire. This involved Star, after all. They were playing with Star's life and mission, and Sapphire again confirmed that Aurora was alive, which was news that Star certainly deserved. No need to go into what Black Diamond had said to infuriate her, but explain the dream? Star deserved that much at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could accept that much. She nodded, accepting a chat over food instead of belaying their hungry bellies. It would give Ellesandra time to cool off, too. She could see the fury as it intermingled the guilt. Each tried to overpower the other, but neither could win in this war. It was just a mess. Star was certainly not going to call anyone unreasonable for what was the equivalent of 'I need a minute'. So down they went to get some food, with Star following Ellesandra's lead.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra smoothed her shirt down. Really, she wanted to take some time in the shower and take advantage of having one to cool down, but she wasn't going to hold it off that long. Plus, they both needed food. So after running her fingers through her hair to untangle knots and pull it up in a ponytail, she would lead Star downstairs for breakfast. Finding a table that was relatively secluded from the rest of everyone, to prevent as much eavesdropping as possible, Ellesandra didn't say anything at first. A waitress would come by and Ellesandra would get just water and a basic breakfast platter, since most taverns didn't exactly have a lot of options for it. It came with eggs, meats and some fruits if the tavern was lucky enough to have them. She was silent as Star would order anything, and she didn't say anything at first. Like Star had assumed, she needed a moment to process. She didn't meet Star's eyes at all while they waited, eyes out on the tavern in the guise of keeping guard and watching for anyone who might be setting up to eavesdrop. Her fury had begun to subside, though it didn't go away entirely, and she'd mostly pushed the guilt and pain back into that unmentioned mountain. Her jaw was still tensed, and she was obviously going to be in a mood for most of the day, but by the time the food came she'd mostly let herself calm down enough that she could actually talk. She'd wait until the waitress left, before speaking, looking down at her plate rather than at Star. "The shadow visited me last night, along with someone named Sapphire Trisfina. Opposite sides of wanting you to find your mother, who Sapphire confirmed is still alive."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star just ordered the same as Ellesandra. She wasn't picky despite her preference and figured it was easiest for the chef at the inn to just make something by rote. Easy and filling. They could portion out who got what once it arrived if they so wished. Star was fine to just let the silence linger for a while, but it seemed there was news. Big news. The moment Ellesandra said this Sapphire woman confirmed her mother was still alive, Star's eyes shot open wide. Tears welled in them. Her lips fell just ever so slightly apart. A dumbstruck, paralyzed look overtook her. She had no words in the immediate. Just a shocked expression as she was flooded with more emotion than she knew what to do with. Which for her, had to be a lot.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't panic or do anything to break Star out of the thought and emotion that overwhelmed her at the statement. Instead, she moved the chosen fruit entirely off her plate over onto Star's while she was dumbstruck, then sat her plate down in front of herself. A sip of water was taken, before she began eating. It might be noted that Ellesandra didn't split Star's breakfast meat or take it, but just gave her fruit. Either way Ellesandra was silent, only glancing at Star briefly, and just letting the news sink in for a few moments and for Star to wrap her head around it. Finally, she added. "This Sapphire person seems to be a servant of the gods, in some way, whereas Black Diamond - that's what the shadow calls themselves - is wanting to kill the gods. They are also the one who was behind the pirates and their power. Anyways, Sapphire wants to see you complete your mission of reconnecting with your mother, and that's apparently on behalf of the gods. So, she's alive and the gods are in your favor in regards to you two meeting up again." Slices of the information in digestible, small chunks. That was what Ellesandra was going for; letting the initial shock of her mother being alive settle before releasing the information that the gods actively wanted her to reconnect to her mother.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star seemed so wholly fixated on the reality that her mother was alive still that she didn't seem to really process the other information given to her. Gods this, war that, it didn't matter to her. "A-Alive.." she finally said. And then came the tidal wave. Relief hit her like a rock from a catapult and she lowered her face into her hands. She trembled and, quietly as she could, sobbed into her palms. The nonchalant manner in which Ellesandra carried on was not at all matched. It meant the world to her to hear this, and whether or not Ellesandra realized it was a catalyst to galvanize her. She had said previously she might not want to know, but here in the face of the information, she was certainly having a positive, if strong, reaction to knowing the truth. Still, it looked like she might need a minute herself. Or might need such a long minute that her food would grow cold before she was centered again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well if there was one way to get rid of all of Ellesandra's fury, it was to see Star break down like that. She hadn't expected that strong of a reaction. She stared at Star for a few moments, before pushing out of her seat and moving around to Star's side of the table. She was gentle, kneeling down next to Star on her side of the table, and reaching out with her left, good arm to wrap it around Star. Once again, as Star began to break down, Ellesandra turned her head and allowed Star to use her shoulder to cry on, to get that physical comfort that Ellesandra knew she needed and wanted. Once again, Ellesandra prepared for the onslaught of emotion that she knew would come through Star's connection to her. Even with her barriers up, she knew that she'd receive a large blast of emotion from the woman and she braced herself against it as soon as she had reached out to touch her. Either way, though, Ellesandra would offer that comfort, the willingness to just wrap her arms around Star and hold her while she recovered. In hindsight, doing this over breakfast, in public, wasn't as good an idea as Ellesandra thought. She'd assumed Star would respond like Ellesandra would have, and that was so, so wrong.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Truly, it had been off the mark. It was the biggest news Star had received in a long time. So when Ellesandra touched her, their two auras resonated together and the crushing waves of mixed relief and sorrow and urgency and a thousand other frantic emotions bombarded Ellesandra's heart all at once. As always, Ellesandra was not forced to feel these emotions herself, but rather the emotions were bared to them to know. The empathetic connection made it so the knight could know all of what was in Star's heart to the degree their connection permitted. Resisting it didn't stop the emotion, though it wasn't pointless either. It just wasn't enough to stop it all. Just enough to take the edge off it all and blunt the feelings a small amount. Star leaned into the knight. She took the comfort. She took all they could give her while slowly finding her way to serenity again. It would take some time, and draw some wandering eyes from the inn, but otherwise proceeded without incident until such time that Star was able to sit upright again and draw in slow, measured breaths. In, out, in out...All just to try and calm down again. She would need to be reminded that she even had food in front of her; there was no guarantee she would be able to even eat in the wake of what was truly monumental news.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was patient, doing her best not to pry in on Star's emotions. Yeah emotions were bared to her and available, but Ellesandra made a concerted effort not to focus on those. Instead, she looked away while holding Star, glaring down anyone who was looking their way for too long, and simply letting Star feel the emotion. It wasn't until Star began to pull away and sit upright again that she moved away, a silent sight of relief coming as the contact stopped and the pure overwhelming plethora of emotion was no longer bearing down upon the knight. She didn't say anything else, but instead pushed Star's plate directly in front of Star's face again to indicate she needed to eat, while moving to begin eating herself. She paid no mind to the food being cold, if it was. She also didn't say anything else, recognizing that Star had experienced much more from that news than Ellesandra had expected. She wasn't sure how long Star might need to recover from that, considering the immensity of her emotions. That was more emotion than Ellesandra ever let herself feel, but also Star was better at processing and feeling emotions than Ellesandra was, so she really had no idea what it would take to get Star back down to normal. It had been good news, right? There had definitely been sorrow there, but she wasn't sure why that would have been sad news. Maybe it was sorrow at being separated? Or the sorrow from the grief and anxiety of what might have happened? She didn't know.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The food hadn't gone cold quite yet. Lukewarm, yes. But even as it was pushed in front of Star, she just...Looked at it initially. She knew she had to eat, but how could she do anything except rise up and charge onward? Of course that was a foolish plan. She didn't even know really where to go besides this lead they were following. And what if her fervor cost her her only chance to get to Myst, then to her home? She couldn't. Even more so, now that she knew her mother lived still. She couldn't risk it. She needed to calm herself, but the knowledge came with the double-edged blade in reinforcing that she could no longer delude herself by thinking nobody was waiting for her. Her mother was waiting. And now she was pouring over every decision she'd ever made. How much time had she wasted? How much closer could she be in this moment if she just kept pushing onwards? From Ellesandra's position, she just looked like she was a million miles away. She was there, but she wasn't present.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star didn't eat, and just stared at her food, Ellesandra reached over so her hand was in front of Star's face, and snapped to get her attention. "Hey." Her voice wasn't the gentle, encouraging voice Star would probably use in this instance. Something to ease someone out of shock and into the right actions. No, Ellesandra's voice was sharp, cutting to get her attention; the command of someone who was telling someone to listen, not requesting it. "You need to eat. You are no good to your mother or anyone else if you don't take care of yourself. Which includes continuing to take today to recover from your magic expenditure; we agreed two days rest here, and today is the second day. Then we'll head off to search for these traveller's from Myst. We have a plan, even if it's not going to be fast. All we have to do is keep moving forward as planned. But to do that, you have to eat, and drink, and rest." Ellesandra didn't know what was going through Star's head, and how close she'd been to exactly those concerns. If she had, she would have phrased it differently, commanded Star not to be rash and run off. But instead, she was emphasizing that Star couldn't forget to practice self care in her attempt to find her mother; she'd get herself killed that way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  As emotional as Star was, she had proven multiple times that she was capable of being rational and thinking things through. Even when it seemed she was acting rashly, she had thought things through. That she was so highly emotional was, perhaps contrary to what most expected of her, precisely why she was able to stay calm and stay logical when she needed to. So she did snap out of it when Ellesandra spoke to her. She looked at them. She nodded gently. And with rather noticeably trembling hands did she set about eating. Slowly, but...She ate. Out of necessity, not enjoyment. Normally so thoughtful and deliberate in her actions, she had been reduced to a woman acting on little more than instinct.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
This was outside of Ellesandra's expertise. How to handle Star was something Star would have been good at, and Marigold. Ellesandra was never good in situations like this. So, she didn't say anything else, just keeping an eye on Star as she ate to make sure she was eating and not about to bite her own finger or something like that because she wasn't paying attention. Ellesandra again regretted saying this over breakfast and not in their room, but it was too late now. How was she supposed to have known it would have that level of effect? On the positive side at least, Star was entirely distracted off of Ellesandra's emotions and how she'd woken up. So, unless Star said anything, Ellesandra let the breakfast go by in silence, sipping on her water and keeping an eye out on any pirates or anyone who was looking over at them with distaste or hatred. The crying had obviously brought some attention earlier, and she wanted to ensure that it hadn't brought any negative feelings or looks from anyone. The last thing Star needed right now was someone to comment something rude to her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There hadn't been a single pirate in sight since the captain had been slain. Just regular city-goers. Some who showed concerning looks for Star, but were swiftly dissuaded as it being none of their business with one glare from Ellesandra. It wasn't long before as far as anyone else was concerned, the two weren't even there. Privacy was secured, at least. Star finished her food without a single word. She had found comfort being near Ellesandra, and that comfort was keeping her together. But this was not the same Star from the morning. Not the cute, sweet girl who could stand up even to Ellesandra in stubborn defiance. She was now a girl who was...Overwhelmed with the world and all that weighed on her shoulders. Not terribly unlike Ellesandra, the difference being that Star was allowing her feelings to flow through her instead of simply pretending she hadn't heard what Ellesandra said.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let the silence go on, and when they had finished their meals she collected their plates and stacked them so they would be easy for the waitress to get. She also placed payment on the counter, but didn't stand from the table, sitting there and watching Star. The waitress came by to check on them, and Ellesandra ordered two hot cocoa's again. This was odd, being it was the morning and those were usually a snack at night - cocoa wasn't cheap or easily accessible for a lot of people. Her having ordered a cup for them both last night was likely seen as a type of luxury for a special occasion, but doing it again this morning? Still, everyone in the inn had seen Star break down earlier, and if that helped soothe her, Ellesandra would do it. "We don't have to go up to the roof, if you don't want to. But take it back to the room and let it warm you some while you go through..." Ellesandra waved at nothing around Star. She couldn't see Star's aura, but she figured Star would know what she meant. Even if Ellesandra couldn't see and read Star's aura, she knew it was there and knew Star had a lot of emotions going through her right now. Obviously, Star would be better at processing said emotions than Ellesandra, and she just wanted to give the tools necessary to help where she could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was, perhaps frustratingly, still silent even as Ellesandra went along and tried to provide comfort in the way of hot cocoa. Star acknowledged the mug with her eyes, but it was again something that she didn't seem keen on diving into drinking. Still. It had an effect, just because it was Ellesandra being thoughtful. They were trying. Star didn't want it to seem like she was ungrateful for their efforts, of course. So she at least took the mug in her hands and slowly stood, electing to move to the room rather than the roof. She wanted to retain the memory of the rooftop as it was, not complicate it with another memory so soon that was so much sadder. So without another word from her, she moved to the room, to her bed, and just...Sat, like a statue, as she worked through whatever it was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected it to make her automatically better. Unlike Star, Ellesandra was horrible in regards to handling people with heavy emotions. She knew Star enjoyed the physical touch comfort, which had been shown previously. Beyond that, the only thing Ellesandra knew to do was something that she herself would have appreciated in that situation. Just the comfort of hot cocoa and the ability to get away from things. As Star took it and just sat in their room with it, Ellesandra began going about her day in the room. She gave Star space, not pressuring her to talk or snap out of her feelings right now. After all, this was a rest day, and if Star needed to take the day to process emotion, then who was Ellesandra to stop her? What Ellesandra did do was some small exercises, working to test her muscles again after the haste spell and push them to see how much endurance she'd gotten back from the resting. She was gentle, not going too far with anything, and if Star did pay any attention she would notice Ellesandra never put too much pressure on her right arm or shoulder, for obvious reasons. Ellesandra was comfortable letting the day pass in silence, but she did make sure to stay in the room with Star, not go out wandering or anything. Even if Star wasn't in the state she was now, Ellesandra was her guard.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star had remained silent through the day. It didn't seem to help her much. She watched Ellesandra from the sideline of her bed. She sipped tentatively at her cocoa. She got up to tend to necessities when she had to. She occasionally shifted her posture. For an hour she looked to be napping. A few attempts to meditate ultimately seemed to fail. She noticed how Ellesandra could not put weight on their arm, idly thinking about the time Ellesandra had carried her. Was that overly strenuous for them? She couldn't know without asking, though she obviously noticed the pain in the woman whenever there was pain to be seen. Thoughts that she sought answers for in her hot cocoa, only to be disappointed by the lack thereof. If Ellesandra had no intentions of breaching the silence, neither would Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Carrying Star hadn't been painful, only because the weight had been positioned onto her back and legs. If she'd had to lift Star up with her right arm, that would have been painful - and weak and shaky. Sure it had put some straight on her shoulder, but as most of the injury was in the arm itself, not at her shoulder, it had been fine. The day went by without speaking, since Star didn't say anything else. Ellesandra lay in bed after her exercise, letting her body recover, then had gotten back up to clean her rapier and do the basic maintenance tasks needed on her weapon and armor. She spent the day comfortably in the silence, only occasionally glancing back over at Star to check in and see that she was still there and not sobbing or anything like that. Occasionally, she met Star's eyes and gave her a silent nod, just to let the woman know she was still here and supported, but if nothing else, she would let Star take the first shower and then would follow suit afterwards. It wouldn't be until they were both preparing and winding down to bed, after eating food and all, that Ellesandra would speak up. "So we're going to go look for the travelers from Myst, tomorrow." A statement, and confirmation of their plan.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The plan and its confirmation was met with just a simple nod. Star had her hot cocoa still. It was long, long since empty. So it was just the mug. But she had been holding onto it through the day, not unlike she had held onto the handkerchief Ellesandra had given her. It was time for bed now, though, so she did relent and leave the mug on the table. The day's work was done, though Star had noticed Ellesandra had always been proper in returning the dishes and ensuring the staff had as easy a time as possible cleaning up. There was some amount of comfort she needed from the mug. But it seemed she had gotten what she needed. It would either stay there until morning to be carried down as the two were heading out, or though Star wouldn't stop Ellesandra if they did choose to bring the single mug back down before bed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced at the mug, but she wasn't going to take it down and bother the staff with it that evening. Plus, if Star needed it throughout the night, for whatever odd comfort it brought her, why take that away from her? No, instead Ellesandra nodded to her. "Good night, Star. Tomorrow we'll set out, if you're ready." She added that last bit as a reassurance that they didn't HAVE to set out tomorrow. If Star needed more time, she could take it - and Ellesandra would still be there with her, guarding her. She would be receptive if Star said anything, but otherwise would lay in bed, facing Star's bed, and close her eyes to drift off to sleep - hopefully without irritating or infuriating gems haunting her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"Good night, Ellesandra," she said in turn, offering a faint smile. She would be awake for a while, but sleep would eventually claim her. Ellesandra's sleep was, perhaps predictably, met with the familiar pull to lucidity. A return to the dream state of the previous night. But just like before, it was not forced upon them. Seemed that Black Diamond had taken the 'rules' set in place by Sapphire seriously. Enough that Ellesandra was given the choice once more. To go into one of the doors, to goad them both out again perhaps, waste everyone's time some more, or just walk to the void beyond and have a regular dream.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra cursed again when she felt herself pulled into the lucidity and staring at the two doors. She was about to turn away and start walking into the void, when a thought struck her. Sapphire obviously knew something about Star's mom. How much? Did she know enough Ellesandra could share with Star, make her feel better? Would sharing any information actually make her feel better? Considering she'd expected the information from last night to help and encourage her, make her excited to continue on, and instead it had made Star break down and cry, Ellesandra wasn't sure. She honestly wasn't sure why Star had responded the way she had. If Ellesandra got news that Marigold had survived - despite seeing her killed in front of her own eyes - Ellesandra wouldn't have been crying. She'd have been taking action, immediately either making plans or acting on plans to go find her, at least to apologize. She closed her eyes to that thought as the guilt and pain surged, but then turned and headed towards Sapphire's door. She opened it, and took a step through, looking around warily as she did so.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The white door opened to reveal a beautiful garden of flowers and thriving nature. A waterfall descended into a still pond in this clearing, and Sapphire stood just off to the side of the pond. Except Sapphire was not just some formless white blur now. She was...Herself. A woman about five-foot-seven with brilliant platinum hair and ocean-blue eyes. Features that closely resembled Star in colour, though that is where the similarities ended. Sapphire's features were sharper, first. Her hair also was styled into two long ponytails off either side of her head. She was clad in a spotless white silk dress. Bare feet rest easy on the soft earth below. But more than anything...Two large, brilliant white wings featured extending off her back, folded for the moment. Sapphire was an angel. "Unexpected but...Pleasantly so, to see you, Ellesandra. What can I do for you?"
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took in a moment to take in the wings and realize what Sapphire was. She really was a servant of the gods, wasn't she? Ellesandra immediately regretted her choice to come in here, but pressed her lips firmly together and crossed her arms. A brief glance was given to the rest of the area, seeing the flowers and waterfall, and thinking that Star would love to visit this place. Unfortunate that it was Ellesandra visiting, who would be too distracted with displeasure at Sapphic to actually enjoy any of this. "My what great wings you have Sapphic, all the better to fly away with?" She retorted immediately. It was childish, and Ellesandra immediately regretted it, but there was still an ounce of that fury that came back from the previous night. She shook her head, taking a deep breath, and tried again. "What can you tell me about Star's mother? Star deserves to know if she's doing well, safe and not captured or something." If she was captured and being held hostage or something, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could share that information with Star. She should, theoretically, but Ellesandra was afraid of how Star would react in that case. But if Aurora was fine, safe, healthy and not in danger at all - would that help Star? Or would that just upset her more that Aurora hadn't come for her? She didn't know, but felt like she needed to ask at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire's brows rose in a strange look at Ellesandra's response. She'll just...Pretend she didn't hear that. When the natural questions followed, she steepled her fingers together before her and paused for a moment to answer the question with a question, much in line with what Ellesandra already thought. "What would you hope to do with that information? If Aurora is well, do you not think a woman of such deep compassion and strength would have come for Star again? It is her own daughter after all. I know that if I had become separated from my daughter, all nine layers of hell would not stand in the way of bringing me back to her." Sapphire gave a sympathetic smile. It answered the question, just not directly. It was bad news, it seemed. "Is it that you've shared the knowledge that Aurora lives with Star, and she does not know how to handle it? I want to help. But I hope you can recognize that...Some information can do more harm than good. Perhaps any further revelations can wait a week. At least long enough for you to reach Myst, if not Gurhal. But I leave it up to you. We want the same end result, I believe. Star and Aurora reunited. Both happy and healthy."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. "Just because she's well, doesn't mean she has full access to her magic. Maybe something happened to it, or is blocking her. Yes, I told Star what happened, and no she did not take it like I expected her to. But I'm also not just going to hide pertinent information. If Aurora is being held hostage by a specific group of people, it's important that I at least know that so I know who and what to look out for. If they are going to be holding Aurora active, they may be looking to capture Star the same way." She honestly didn't know if she'd tell Star, even if she thought Star would deserve to know. But, she was certain that it was better for her to know, at least. She needed to know what situation they would be walking into.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire gently nodded. "As you wish. As you suspect might have been possible, Aurora is being held captive. One of the lesser minions of Black Diamond keeps her imprisoned. You already were introduced to her greater minions, I believe you mentioned. Emerald and Ruby and Onyx. Not their real names, I'm sure you may have surmised. Neither is Black Diamond the true name of that person." Sapphire clearly knew much more about Black Diamond than she was sharing, but it was clearly purposeful. Just as this dreamland was changed to be a matter of choice, there was some sort of mutual respect given back to not reveal things about Black Diamond that they themselves did not reveal, and so did Sapphire stick to particularly neutral language on the matter. "But I digress. There are not one, but two forces who will be hostile to you should they learn of your intentions. The first is simply the Cult of the Black Diamond. Fanatics of the very same shadowy person who stands opposed to me. The others are known as the Apostles of Faust. If you embarked on this journey a few years ago, they would be neutral, perhaps. But there exists now a tenuous alliance between these two groups. I'm sure Black Diamond will send their greater thralls after you as well, though I would not expect the greater thralls to engage you in direct conflict most of the time. They act in clandestine ways more than direct confrontation. Ultimately, it is the Cult of the Black Diamond who has Aurora in captivity. Though, unfortunately the 'where' of that is beyond even me. But I'm sure you're capable of being convincing enough to figure that part out in time."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded. She was glad to have asked, at least. Knowing that there were other of Black Diamond's minions out there, and that if she sensed one again - would she sense them again? - it may be worth investigating safely to see if Star's mother was there was important. The information regarding the the Apostles of Faust, an organization she hadn't heard of before, was also useful and something to keep an eye out for. "Well, Sapphic, I appreciate the information and will keep an eye out for both groups during our travels. One more question, will these doors begin appearing every night or is this going to be a special circumstance situation?" For some reason, the idea of them appearing during special circumstances was even more annoying to her. If they were just consistently there for her to choose to go to or not, that was one thing. But if they were going to be sent as a sign that one or both of them wanted to talk to her? That would get annoying, fast.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was something about Sapphire's face that suggested she found the nickname she was given mildly amusing. A little tug of her lips each time Ellesandra said it. Otherwise her posture was neutral; a calm stance with hands folded before her, left over right, which displayed her gold wedding band and diamond engagement ring on her left hand's ring finger. She nodded to the thanks. "It's my intention to come to an agreement with Black Diamond that we both cease. When you get to Myst, it will, for reasons that involve high level arcana that I would not wish to bore you with, be impossible for either of us to present ourselves in your dreams. And when you get to Gurhal, it will become possible again, but...At that point, Black Diamond has stated that is where they will consider you their enemy. So I can see the only purpose to continue to appear to you would be to torment you. It's my intent to prevent that. But rather than decide what is best for you, I'd rather you tell me. Do you want to maintain a line of contact to one or both of us? Would you prefer to be left alone entirely? I can make no promises to the conduct of Black Diamond, as they have a proclivity to be...Clandestine and insidious. I can only promise to do all I can to keep them away from you, if such is your desire. I don't promise perfection but...Most nights, at least, should be free of influence." A few subtle implications came with the explanation, perhaps most notably being that this powerful angel was either equally matched, or perhaps at a disadvantage in power against Black Diamond. Clear enemies, and yet neither seemed capable of defeating or fully controlling the other. And somehow, Star and Aurora, and now Ellesandra, were caught between them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra ignored the obvious amusement from Sapphire at the nickname. The fact she was amused might imply she was actually sapphic, which was neat. It was also just amusing, overall. "An agreement with that being? Count me out of it. The only agreement I'd get in with them is my rapier through whatever counts as a throat for them." They were sure they hadn't seen Black Diamond's true form at all, so it was just going to be a matter of finding them eventually. Hearing that they would both be leaving her alone while in Myst was reassuring; perhaps their time in Myst itself would be relatively safe, if Black Diamond couldn't have much hold or sway there. Oh, that didn't mean they wouldn't encounter other dangers natural to Myst, but at least they wouldn't have to worry about these two beings fucking with them at all. At the idea of them being considered an official enemy of Black Diamond, she shook her head. She should already be considered that, but she wasn't going to say that and encourage them to attack before they got to Myst. "Perhaps you continue giving the choice each night. If you do that, it might encourage them to not just step into my dreams forcefully like they have in the past." She wasn't sure, but she was willing to bet if she refused to have that choice and just always go to normal dreams for the rest of time, eventually Black Diamond would invade them. But if she left that choice open, she was forcing Sapphic to also be present potentially, and which might dissuade them from doing anything shady. or maybe not, Ellesandra really didn't know.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire gave a difficult expression at the mention of Ellesandra putting their rapier through the throat of Black Diamond. "Were that all it would take," was all she had to say in response to that. Quiet, and somber. Not very fitting for the bright angel standing before Ellesandra indeed. "If you wish to retain the choice, then it shall be so. Keeping it that way is likely to keep Black Diamond more passive, and should they decide to be waiting in front of their door, I can be there as well to keep them in check." Just as Ellesandra had surmised, keeping Sapphire close would have its benefit at least insofar as countering the shadowy counterpart. "And of course, I can remain available to you, should you need or wish to speak on any matters. I know that Black Diamond has already tried to turn you against me, and will continue to do so. I can't ask you to trust me, but I hope to earn that in time all the same."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"That would work perfectly then." Her plan of using the apparent rival between these two to get some semblance of privacy and peace for herself was apparently a good one. She nodded to herself, considering it, and wondering if she could just chill in the 'waiting room' of whatever dream this was rather than going into her normal dreams, too. Would that be a way to avoid the nightmares she had? It might be worth testing, but she didn't want to ask that. It would be too vulnerable, with some angel she didn't trust. "Sapphic, all offense intended, I won't be a servant of the gods like you, and won't trust you fully because you are. Our goals happen to align right now, so I'm comfortable working together. But I won't trust you are making suggestions or acting of your own will. Black Diamond is an ass who needs to be stopped, but they aren't wrong. Gods can roll over and die for all I care." There was a small semblance of pain in the statement, but it was mostly repressed anger. Anger that she'd not let herself show when it happened because she'd been surrounded by people who followed Torm and were happy to continue to serve him, but how her faith in him - and thus, other deities - had been utterly crushed. This had only been reinforced with what happened with Marigold, and what happened after. Her eyes flashed at the idea of being used by the gods, but the only thing she could do was do what she thought and felt was right in the moment. If it happened to align with what the gods wanted, that was unfortunate but whatever. But she would not be brought out of her normal acting for them, not again. "Is there anything else, or am I free to go back to normal dreams now?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "That remains yours to decide," responded Sapphire, showing a sympathetic expression as Ellesandra declared there could not be trust between them because of her service to the gods. "I am here to answer your questions and offer guidance only if you ask for it. I know how hollow it will sound to you, but I do genuinely want you to walk your own path and support you in that. But that aside, if you have any other questions, ask them. Else...I won't hold you from your slumber."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waved her hand. "No other questions. Have a good...whatever for you." She was going to say have a good night, but did Sapphire sleep? If she was always here while Ellesandra was sleeping, was that because she didn't need to sleep? Or was she just awake at the times Ellesandra slept? Questions she didn't really care to have an answer for. Turning, she would move back through the door, and if needed, walk off into the void, hoping that her nightmares would not come afterwards, and that the brief spike in rage wouldn't have woken Star at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Just as the nights before, there were no regular dreams on the nights the conversations transpired. Even the short conversation seemed to take Ellesandra from night to morning. Perhaps there was time between that just wasn't remembered. Either way, the morning came to find Star already up, showered, and sitting on her bed with a look of passive impatience, if the idly tapping foot was anything to go by. She looked ready to go.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra woke up, blissful in not having had nightmares, and slowly moved into a sitting position. Her eyes trailed over to Star, who was tapping her foot and looking like she had been ready to leave for the past hour. Was that because she was feeling particularly rushed, now that she knew her mother was alive? Or had Ellesandra slept in more than she'd expected to? "Mornin'." She said softly, reaching up to rub at her eyes for a moment before standing and stretching. Her muscles were still sore, but it was minimal now; the kind you got after a decent workout, and could easily be worked through. It wouldn't effect her performance at all. Another glance was given to Star already being ready. "I'll be quick." She commented, grabbing a change of clothes and stepping into the bathroom to just change into fresh clothes and do basic morning hygiene rituals. She didn't shower, as they would just be getting dirty throughout the day anyways and she'd showered last night. She stepped back out, changed and moving to put her armor and such on afterwards. "Did you sleep alright?" Trying to make casual conversation, for the pure purpose of judging how well Star was doing today compared to yesterday.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star flashed a smile at Ellesandra when they said they would be quick. Looking out the single window in the room would reveal that it was barely dawn. It was early. Earlier than either of them would normally be up. About the only way Star could hope to be up before Ellesandra. A situation that was made clearer when the knight asked if Star slept okay, earning them a small shake of her head. She said nothing further on the matter, content to just answer the question with a negative. She didn't have bags under her eyes or any visible signs of fatigue, so despite not sleeping well she was well and clearly awake at least.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The shake of her heard and lack of response concerned Ellesandra for her companion. She continued putting on her armor, but moved to stand in front of Star as she did so, buckling straps mostly by habit and memory without looking at them, and instead looking at Star directly. "Star, if there is something you need to say or talk about, do so. I'm comfortable with silence and am happy to travel in silence with you today or however long it takes you to get out of this.." She paused, waving her hand. Emotional state sounded demeaning, but she wasn't sure what else to call it. "Headspace you're in" That worked, right? "But if something is wrong or bothering you and you don't want to just be silent, then it's open." It was probably odd, Ellesandra inviting Star to share when Ellesandra herself absolutely refused to do so. There was an important note here though - she was offering this if Star was wanting to share. There was no pressure to do so if she didn't want to. Ellesandra of all people knew that sometimes it was best - or it felt best, even if it wasn't - to process silently, take some time to yourself, but that didn't seem to be how Star handled things. It hadn't been up to this point, anyways.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked up at Ellesandra from her seated posture and just...Stared at them for a moment. There was some measure of recognition for the disconnect. Sure, the offer was a passive one. But the way Star looked at the knight still suggested she found the offer a little...Unfair on some level. Not enough to say anything. Just enough to show a rare flash of upset before it melted into a sigh through her nose as eyes closed. "...I'm just coming to terms with the realities that either I wasn't important enough to come looking for, or the news that my mother is alive comes with a big caveat that something awful has happened to her. Neither of those realities is easy to bear. I just want to get on with this. I know you wouldn't have let us leave yesterday, so I'm just waiting with all the patience I can muster until we're ready to get a move on." Just as Star had said in the past, the knowledge that her mother was alive had changed things. Her expedience was multiplied tenfold. It was giving her tunnel vision. There was a good chance if they ran into another Morrun and Lissana situation where they needed help, Star might not offer it as she pursued her goal with a redoubled, galvanized fervor.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ah, decisions decisions. Should Ellesandra tell her? If Star was looking, she'd probably even see the confliction of wanting to be honest with Star, and not hide anything that didn't have to be hidden, but also concern for Star and her state of mind if she shared the news. She was silent while Star spoke, explaining her attempt at patience, and finished putting her armor on. The rapier was added, then the knife strapped into it's sheath just beneath her armored skirt. Lastly, she ensured everything was in her pack, then threw it over her good shoulder before sliding her right arm through the strap as well. When she finished, she turned to look at Star with a serious expression on her face. "Star, it's...the latter. I'm not sure how awful, if she's being treated well, but I do know that she doesn't have a choice in the matter of her coming to you." She paused, considering if she should share who had captured her, but she'd come this far, hadn't she? Might as well reveal the whole truth. "The shadow I spoke of, who apparently uses the name Black Diamond, has her hostage." The words were said softly, knowing that Star wouldn't like them. It was one of those things that, unlike Aeras, Ellesandra was not good at. Aeras could deliver devastating news like this and somehow make someone focus on the silver lining, that Aurora was still alive and could be rescued. Ellesandra didn't know how to do that, but she couldn't just keep that a secret from Star. Maybe it had been foolish to ask, thinking she might have been able to, but Ellesandra's honor wouldn't allow it. She stepped forward, offering a hand to Star in case she wanted an embrace after that news, like previously.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked at Ellesandra with an expression that slowly, bit by painful bit, broke. Tears welled in her eyes. Pain built behind her eyes. Not only was there possibly some awful torture happening to her mother, but they were in the clutches of this dark monster. It was disheartening. Dispiriting. Star's resolve was strong enough to withstand, but...The truth still shook her to her core. Enough that she didn't want to waste time dealing with her emotions. Instead she shot up to her feet and began hastily towards the door. She was choking back sobs, but if Ellesandra wasn't going to stop her, she was going to charge out and make a ruckus until she secured a coach to take her to the next step in their journey.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did stop her. The thing about Ellesandra pushing down her emotions was, well, she pushed them down. She didn't let them overwhelm her, like Star was doing now. The pure exception to that being the other night in the Elven settlement. Star wouldn't be able to hike while feeling this much, right now. So when Star tried to move towards the door, Ellesandra caught her by the arm and stopped her. She gave a gentle tug towards herself, though she wouldn't force Star into a hug or embrace if Star didn't want it. The tug was to encourage Star to move towards her rather than the door, and if she did, Ellesandra would wrap both arms around her and squeeze tighter than she had any other time doing so. If not, she just held onto Star's arm, either way saying - "Star, rushing right now isn't the right move. Take a breath, process or repress whatever works for you, but if you rush out you're just going to get yourself into danger. You HAVE to take care of yourself so you are in a good state to help your mother WHEN we find her." Ellesandra emphasized when, not if.

  There was a contest of desires the moment Ellesandra pulled Star back. One side of her demanded she push Ellesandra away and storm out. That every second mattered, now. That with this knowledge, every second wasted was possibly the second that would make them arrive a second too late. Then, the fate of her mother would truly be on her shoulders in her mind. There wasn't a way this played out where she avoided feeling soul-crushing guilt if they didn't find Aurora alive. But the other side of her? The other side of her demanded she listen to Ellesandra. Demanded she accept the hug. Accept the closeness she craved with her companion. Ultimately...Star was, at her core, a woman of heart. A woman of companionship. Solidarity. She could not reject Ellesandra. So she threw her arms around them, desperate and needy as she sobbed and shook and clung to the knight. "S-She could be suffering!" she cried. "She could be being tortured! She needs me! I need to save herrrrrr!" she continued to cry out in long, heavy sobs. A broken sort of crying that wasn't too different from the night Ellesandra ran off to cry to themselves. The cries of pain that came from a wound that cut as deeply as wounds could cut.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra slid her hand up to rest in Star's hair, pulling her to lean into Ellesandra's shoulder. She simultaneously squeezed at her back, and let her hand just casually and lightly message into Star's scalp and hair. She turned her head away from Star, but tilted it so the side of her head rested against Star's own. "I know." She whispered, knowing she would have felt the exact same way if this had been Marigold. She HAD felt that way, when it was Marigold. "But trust me, Star. Rushing won't do you, or her, any good. You'll put yourself into danger and potentially make it worse. We will find her, okay? I promise you that." There was more that Ellesandra wanted to say, but she didn't entirely believe it. And she knew Star would be able to see through that. Things like it wouldn't be Star's fault if they hurt her, because Ellesandra would be a hypocrite with that. In a very similar situation, Ellesandra took all the blame - not the ones who had captured Marigold, but herself. Granted the situation wasn't exactly the same, but it was close enough that the parallel wasn't lost on her. Wordlessly, she'd walk them both backwards to one of the beds and pulled Star down on it with her so that Star didn't have to worry about standing, worry about collapsing into Ellesandra or anything. She could just lay and let herself get entirely wrapped up by the knight, big spoon like, and cry until she got it out of her system.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was malleable to Ellesandra's will. She allowed herself to be laid and spooned. The emotions she felt were overflowing, and the barrier between her and Ellesandra was almost non-existent in the moment. Their resonant auras shattered through any resistance, opening their hearts to one another in the moment. It allowed Ellesandra to feel the depths of Star's sorrows, the guilt she felt for letting her mother send her away, for not standing beside her mother even at the cost of her own life. The guilt that compounded with the knowledge that Aurora might be suffering. The blame focused inward, feeding the growing mound of sorrow that swelled in her chest. The parallels were certainly there to be drawn. But Star dealt with this in the direct opposite way to the knight. She let it all flow through her. She let herself experience all the hurt. And the unfortunate reality was that with Ellesandra spooning her, holding her close, they too were experiencing it. Not through their own heart, but the potent sorrows that so closely mirrored the knight's own were plain for their heart to reach out and understand, perhaps even inadvertently trigger their own mirrored sorrows. Whatever the case, Star would need...A while before she was okay again. She'd been doing a lot of crying lately, and the fatigue was sure to mount for it eventually.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expect to fully feel Star's emotions this time. Previously, she could see them, know they were there, feel that Star had them - but to actually feel them herself? It took everything in her not to just yank away from Star at that. She did twitch, the urge there, but she stopped herself from actually pulling away last second. Trepidation was there, but it was easily overpowered by the strength of Star's own emotions right now. The guilt, it was so familiar. As she felt it, it was hard to even separate it from her own guilt at how Marigold had just went and gave herself over, for Ellesandra. She let out a breath, as if punched in the gut, when those feelings began to overwhelm into her own. "Fuck." She breathed out, not even realizing it. She wanted to hold Star and help her through it, but she didn't know if she could. Star was just...FEELING all of this. And on top of that, unbeknownst to her, Star would be feeling how her own emotions were tugging at those same ones in Ellesandra. It felt like a void inside of Ellesandra, one that she avoided at all costs, was slowly leaking the pain and guilt from it. The mixture of shame in that guilt, feeling as if it had been her fault, and also that being reinforced by others in her life afterwards. The pain at losing someone Ellesandra had loved; it wasn't as overwhelming as Star's only because it was held back, repressed firmly, but the extreme feeling from Star broke into it some. Ellesandra gritted her teeth, trying to resist that urge to pull away entirely. She wasn't prepared to actually feel these emotions with Star. Her arms around her slackened a little, but she didn't pull away. Instead she took a deep breath and did everything she could to reinforce the emotional barrier between them. It was surely not even close to enough, but she attempted it. Additionally, she hardened herself to the emotions she was feeling as much as she could. If she could repress them just like she did with her own emotions, she would. It wouldn't stop her from feeling it right now, but she would push them down and instead use them to fuel an anger and hatred for Black Diamond, for doing this to Aurora and Star. Still, she felt herself curl up against Star and tears prick at her own eyes from the strength of them, teeth clenched and breathing deeply to resist pulling away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star turned in Ellesandra's hold at some point during this, pulling herself against the knight instead of being spooned by them. Their desire to hold Star was clear. As was their desire to help. Ellesandra would in turn feel the same, reciprocated. A desire to hold Ellesandra, to be close to them. A safety she felt in their arms. Happiness from their presence. Comfort. Worries that tied to thoughts of being overeager. Pleasant feelings that stemmed from their night on the rooftop. It was complicated and nuanced, crushed under the weight of wave after wave of guilt and powerful sorrows. But in the depths of all that sadness, there was that singular core of comfort. Star wanted to be near Ellesandra. It was a deep, strong need for the other woman. When Star had said they cared about Ellesandra, it was a sincere statement. The care and concern ran deep in Star. A sensation of anxiety associated with Ellesandra being away from her was closely nestled in a globe of fear that closely was bound to a sensation of loneliness. It was difficult to parse a lot of the emotion for someone like Ellesandra; the mystic connection was intuitive to some degree, but it was like learning to control a whole new appendage that was foreign and had no basis to relate to. The basics were easy enough to understand, but the more complex the emotions became, the more they began to tie in knots and become indecipherable. Her heart and Ellesandra's were open to one another; if there were any doubts Ellesandra held, conscious of unconscious, the connection rather forcibly contested them. No matter where Ellesandra might look, there were no ulterior motives to be found. The concern, the admiration, the comfort, the happiness, it was all genuine. A great desire to help Ellesandra lingered as well, but it was held back, with a bubble of frustration, under a greater notion of respect. Star's heart being bare allowed a great insight into just how pure the empath was at her core, and thusly how deep her pain ran from the belief that she had done wrong, that she had caused another harm, then amplified a thousand fold because it was her own mother. Outside of the connection, Star wailed and sobbed and shook as each pound of sorrow moved through her heart. Well and truly, ignorance had been bliss for her, and having to face the reality of what she believed was her own fault, was tearing her heart into bloody pieces of gore right before Ellesandra's eyes.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't focus on any of Star's emotions, as much as she could. She was focusing on just the feel of Star in her arms and how she felt sorry for Star. She was simultaneously sorry that she shared this information, but still affirmed in her belief it was the right thing to do in the long run. If Star found out later, and learned that Ellesandra had known the whole time but let Star 'slack off', per say, she wasn't about to deal with that level of anger from Star. She felt the obvious care, concern, admiration, but Ellesandra didn't let herself focus on it, think about it. In response to it though, Star might feel that Ellesandra felt...particularly protective of Star. A caring for her that came form a sense of similarity between Star and Marigold - though Star wouldn't necessarily know that exactly. A refusal to let the same thing happen to Star, and a firm belief that she would protect Star as best as she could. Additionally, there was attraction. Star was pretty, and Ellesandra had considered flirting with her. She would have, if Star were not a client and also someone who Ellesandra thought could handle a casual thing. This attraction wasn't nearly strong enough to overwhelm the obvious grief and guilt that was wracking Star though, and even as Star turned into her and held her in response, Ellesandra reached up to run her fingers through Star's hair and do what she could to comfort the empath. Ellesandra raised her head so that her chin was resting atop Star's and Star was pulled into her chest - as uncomfortable as that might be with her armor, it was still a closeness and something to hold onto. She'd wait out this feeling, just trying to silently be there for Star, and filter out as much of the pain she was getting from her as possible.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The honourable notion of it all resonated with Star. It was the right choice. It was better that she know. It was the immediately painful choice, but the one that resulted in the least pain overall. The honest path. It forced Star to face the things she was afraid to face. And it hurt. But it wouldn't kill her. It wouldn't beat her. Because each time there was a wave of pain, of sorrow, she gripped onto Ellesandra a little more tightly for a short while. Sure, it was just armor. But where the physical failed to convey how she needed them, their resonating auras made it clear as day. The desire to protect, and the desire to be protected, melded perfectly together in splendid harmony. Just as Ellesandra's attraction was met in turn with mutual attraction. Star had said plainly that she found Ellesandra pretty. It was more than just a passing comment of course, a hollow remark. It was genuine as could be, though there was far more to this emotion than just some surface level admiration that could not be accurately understood without dedicated focus. Nuance and subtlety permeated the emotions surrounding the more intimate parts of her heart, but it would be easy to see a pathway from the feelings of safety, security, admiration, and desire for closeness to blossom into something...More, even if it now was but a seed yet to breach its shell and sprout roots; little more than a flickering spark that needed to be fanned to ignite. Such emotion was present, though no single emotion could bear any focus for long even if Ellesandra did choose to do so. Regardless, it would be the better part of an hour before Star finally grew too tired to cry anymore, before the walls shakily began to restructure between them. Not effective walls, of course. But the minimal barrier that spoke of at least attempting to separate their hearts again. Still...Star was in no shape to face any challenges. She still needed comfort.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra didn't push Star to do anything while she recovered. Each wave was felt, and she just held Star, alternating to petting her head, rubbing at her back, squeezing at her, and just holding her lightly throughout the waves of pain and sobbing. Even as it stopped, as she began to recover from it and build barriers back up, Ellesandra held her. Just because she'd cried herself out right then didn't mean that she no longer needed that comfort - she knew that even without the emotional connection. Ellesandra had done her best not to pry into the feelings she'd felt from Star during their embrace, actively not thinking about them and focusing on other things to help keep her mind focused away from them, so all she'd really gotten was that the attraction was returned in a way that wasn't just 'oh look she's so pretty!' that some people felt. As Star did begin to calm more, the crying stopping and that wall fully built again - even if not as strong as normal - Ellesandra pulled away just enough so that she could look down into Star's face, and eyes if they were open. "How about we stay here and lay like this for a little longer, then you go shower again and see if you can restabilize yourself. I'll have breakfast out here afterwards, and then we can start on our way for the day, okay?" She paused, and then added. "Do you need to talk about anything?" Ellesandra was doing what she would need in this situation. She would need a plan. Sure, she'd just let herself feel all the pain and guilt. Now time to push it away, plan the logical path forward, and then start executing it. She didn't know if this would help Star at all, and knew Star preferred talking, which is why she added the last bit there too.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked back up at Ellesandra, wholly embraced by the comforts of their arms, gestures, and voice. She stared deeply into Ellesandra's eyes in this moment, as if seeking their soul through their gaze. A gaze that said, without saying a word, that there was...So, so much she needed to talk about. So much she needed to say to Ellesandra. But despite that, she gently shook her head. "I just need to be held by you a little longer. Just a little longer." After that time, the rest of Ellesandra's plan was free to take shape if the knight sought to take that path. It didn't really bring any comfort to Star to have such a plan of action, but the notion of moving forward towards her goal was something to focus on outside of the countless thoughts that remained unsaid.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did exactly that. The staring and soul gazing seemed...odd, and Ellesandra looked away, uncomfortable by the intensity of the stare. But she did hold Star, squeezing a little tighter and even going so far as to wrap her legs around Star's so that she could feel entirely enveloped and held, entirely protected. She'd pulled Star back into her as well, gaze moving back up to the room and silently just letting Star feel the comfort she needed. Her heart beat a little harder than it probably should be, a nervousness at this embrace since Ellesandra had not truly held someone like this in...years. She'd taken lovers, but the last time she'd held a lover like this had been Sophia, long before the incident had happened. She didn't let herself think about that often, but now she did let her mind stray, simply because it was something to focus on rather than the feel of Star in her arms.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star naturally morphed into the hold, shifting to be more flush against Ellesandra. The tangling of legs, the tenderness of the hold, the rising pulse...It certainly stirred something in Star. She was far too sad to go shifting into something amorous, but the way her sorrows opened up her vulnerability? It made it all the easier for Ellesandra's presence to affect her. She tucked her head under Ellesandra's chin where it felt natural to keep it and just basked in silent comfort. It was nice. The emotional walls steadily grew stronger, but for the time they remained broken open, Ellesandra would be able to feel the quiet harmony of their auras with one another. The feeling of this moment being...Right. Natural. For as different as the two were, there were aspects big and small where they completed each other. And in this moment, there wasn't anyone else in all the realms that could bring Star the comfort she needed in this very moment other than the woman who now held her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let Star settling into her relax her a little. Oh, she was still on guard - she didn't know if she'd ever able to let her guard down while touching Star. But still, it felt - right. A rightness she hadn't felt, ever. One of those moments where you just knew you were in the right spot, doing what you should be doing. Not necessarily that it was fated, but more than in the situation they were in, this was definitely the right thing to do. The closeness and how much she enjoyed just feeling Star against her, even if it had been from a situation in which Star had been distraught, scared Ellesandra a little. And once she realized that, there was a solid wave of guilt that slammed into her. Guilt at being able to move on, to enjoy the company of another like this in more than just a physical, pleasurable way. She'd never let herself feel a connection with someone since the incident, nothing more than a pleasurable lay that they were both okay with being just that. She almost pulled away from Star when she realized that, her body shifting as if about to, but then she remembered why Star was against her. This wasn't a post coital cuddle. This wasn't waking up in the morning after sleeping together, holding onto one another and enjoying the closeness of a partner. This was Ellesandra offering Star comfort while she ached and dealt with the guilt and sorrow of knowing her mother was alive, but being held captive by someone who obviously had no care for someone else's personal boundaries, based on what happened to Lissana. Was Star worried that the same thing might be, or have happened to her mother? She couldn't imagine that feeling. So instead of pulling away, like she instinctively wanted to do, she let her arms tighten in around Star again, adjusting her head so her chin pressed into the top of Star's own head reassuringly, and closed her eyes. She'd stay like this until Star moved away, or said something.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star couldn't know what made Ellesandra want to pull away, only that there was some apprehension. Some sort of fear. But that fear also was quashed. Choosing Star over these fears. It felt good. A calm happiness washed over her at that. It was a reassurance that she was important to Ellesandra. She didn't dig deeper than that. It was what she needed, though. As she had said to Ellesandra before, the connection between their hearts, the unwarded openness and vulnerability between them, even if it wasn't intentional, had allowed her to know deep in her heart, as surely as one can ever know something, that she mattered. That she wasn't alone. And that made this daunting task, this dangerous quest, feel more possible. It made Ellesandra's voice echo in her head. 'We will find her', it echoed. 'I promise you that'. And with that, Star drew in a deep breath, squeezed Ellesandra one more time, then leaned up and placed a soft kiss on their cheek before pulling away, rather immediately blushing for what she did...But still smiled. "...Thank you, Ellesandra. Thank you for staying with me." Did that mean in the moment? In general? Both? The sincere appreciation she wore suggested both.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star began to move, she looked down at her, only to rear her head back with wide eyes when Star kissed her cheek. There was obvious confusion in response to that action, and a nervousness that caused her stomach to churn. A few blinks were given at her, even as Star thanked her, and then her she looked at Star's burning cheeks. Okay, that was enough holding. The guilt came back again, the fear that she was letting Star in too much and being unfair to Marigold - even if Marigold was dead - hit Ellesandra even harder after the brief cheek kiss. She released Star from her embrace and rolled to the other side of the bed, moving to sit up and throw her legs over the edge of the bed, back to Star. "It was my fault you felt that way, since I shared the news with you against Sapphic's recommendation." She just couldn't have held it back - her honor wouldn't have let her, but especially not after what Star had said that morning. "Are you feeling up to moving about now?" A very obvious subject change, while Ellesandra tried to build her barriers fully back up. Damn auramancer and resonance and making her private emotions not private.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a small confusion upon seeing the guilt. Star couldn't quite pin down what the root of such an emotion would be, so she would be left just assuming she overstepped. Her own guilt rose at that, which at least gave a sobering wave to clear the blush from her cheeks. "I'm glad you did. It hurts to know but...I'm better for knowing. I can act more appropriately, instead of embracing ignorance. Instead of just relying on hope." Truly, despite the pain, the steady measure of Star's voice suggested she was in a better headspace. The red tearstains on her face and the slight hoarseness to her voice told the story of the pain necessary to reach this state, but she was better for it. "Being around you helps cement in my heart that...Even the most difficult truths need to be shared. Fear has held me back from that in the past but...No more." She gave a smile to her knightly companion. "I'm ready, now."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She was glad, really, that Star appreciated the truth. They'd get along, since Ellesandra wasn't one to hold back information she knew that was relevant just to spare Star's feelings. She did feel bad about how much pain Star was in right now, because surely even after all of that crying she still would have that sorrow and guilt. Standing after the confirmation - which was needlessly sappy, Ellesandra thought, though she was ignoring the compliment within - she moved to the door and was about to open it for them both but then stopped. She looked back at Star's face, and blinked a few times. "Oh, that's right. Did you want to freshen up while I got food for us? When travelling we'll need to use the food Lissana and Morrun gave us so it doesn't go bad right away, but while we're at the tavern might as well get our breakfast here."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile at the question and nodded. "I think I should, yes. A shower to make myself presentable and calm down sounds nice," she said, then set about moving to the shower. The trip down to place an order for breakfast would be as typical as every other time, save for one thing. There appeared to be someone watching Ellesandra. From one of the corners of the general room, one of the corners that Ellesandra and Star had seated themselves at previously to avoid wayward eyes, there was a cloaked figure whose scarlet eyes followed Ellesandra. The black cloak obscured some of their face, but there didn't appear to be any weapons brandished by the cloaked figure. Instead, there was a blank card in front of them, and they had a brush in one feminine hand, with a series of coloured inkwells off to the side. Their gaze wasn't malicious, but rather...Studious, as if committing all of Ellesandra's features to memory. To someone less paranoid, the gaze might be overlooked, but Ellesandra was almost certain to notice the fixed gaze while their typical swiveled vision scanned the room for threats. Was this figure a threat? One couldn't say either way at first glance.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded, and watched for Star to enter the bathroom before she'd turn to head downstairs. She was concerned about her companion, that was obvious, but there were also obvious reasons to be concerned. She also felt that guilt, one which was hard to acknowledge since acknowledging why she felt it acknowledged Marigold's death. She got the basic breakfast platter for them both, though also got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for Star since they figured she needed something extra this morning. And Star liked, juice, right? She didn't remember for certain, but she also thought she might have seen Star drinking some at Morrun's. Either way, just a little extra to make her feel better so she wouldn't dread the hike today. It was likely Star hadn't gotten much sleep, so Ellesandra was going to go easy on any pace and encourage Star to slow down if she tried otherwise. Her eyes did eventually turn as they were scanning the room and land on one particular cloaked figure. The scarlet eyes caught her attention, along with the black cloak. Her eyes narrowed - surely, this wasn't black diamond, no? Potentially one of his servants, perhaps? The obvious gaze at her, studious, made it so that Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable not addressing it. Best to address it without Star here, safe in their room instead. So while waiting for their breakfast, Ellesandra would walk over, stopping a respectable distance away from this cloaked figure. "Can I help you?" The question was polite, but the tone was forced - obviously assuming the worst about the person after their run ins with Black Diamond recently.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The figure looked at Ellesandra as they approached. They slowly drew back the hood of their cloak. Two furry ears poked up from atop their head of black hair. The woman wore a neutral expression. "My apologies," she began. "I was merely using your likeness as inspiration for my art," she continued, eyes drifting down to the blank card in front of her. The card was nearly twice as long as it was wide, what one would expect of fortune telling cards. As the woman pressed her sable-haired brush down to the card, its bristles dripping with a rainbow of inks mixed upon the hairs, the inks seemed to come to life upon the blank card. Colours spread across the canvas of the card, forming depths of hue and shading. A black border outlined the card, which featured Ellesandra's likeness. The card was split down the middle by a jagged golden line, with the left half depicting half of Ellesandra broken, beaten, bloody, and defeated. The other half depicted Ellesandra proud, pristine, heroic, and triumphant standing tall with her rapier firm in hand. The broken side had Ellesandra's armor cracked and splintered. The heroic side had it pristine and polished. The background behind Ellesandra on the broken side looked to be a dungeon of some sort, with wrought iron manacles attached to chains affixed to the stone wall behind them. The triumphant side depicted a background of a beautiful, flowery meadow. Across the bottom of the card, a tan ribbon bore the name of the card. However, the name changed depending on which side Ellesandra happened to be looking at. If they looked at the broken side, the card bore the name 'Defeat', and if their eyes fixed upon the triumphant side, the name of the card shifted to say, perhaps expectedly, 'Triumph'. The artistry bore impossible detail in it, capturing Ellesandra's likeness perfectly down to the individual strands of silvery hair. All of it formed itself through this woman's curious magic touch in less than a minute, where a master artist might take months to recreate such a thing of beauty. The furry-eared woman didn't seem to find anything strange about this, of course, as she turned the card around for Ellesandra to see, if they so wished to look upon it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned at the explanation, and the sight of the furry ears. That didn't seem like something that Black Diamond would have, but maybe Ellesandra had seriously misjudged them? No, this person might still a servant of Black Diamond, but just because she was wearing a black cloak and had red eyes didn't mean anything in specific. Her eyes moved to stare at the card as it was formed however, eyes widening as the art seemed to draw itself and definitely was a likeness of her. Her mouth opened, both impressed at how well the woman had just done that - it really did look like her - and bothered by the subject of the card itself. That struck a little too close for comfort, and Ellesandra was already dealing with Star being able to see into her emotions, as well as Black Diamond and apparently Sapphire knowing her past and thoughts. It put her even more on guard as her arms crossed, frowning down at the card, then back up to the woman. "And...do you typically use people's likeness without their permission?" She could compliment the card - that's what Star probably would do. But Ellesandra was wary, cautious, and didn't like being the subject of magic without her permission. If this card in any way was magically connected to her, that would not be ideal.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "People do not tend to notice me, if I am being honest. There was no offence meant, truly. But it is only upon certain people that I feel the spark of inspiration. It was important that this card be created." The woman spoke with a tone that implied she believed her words were fact. A certain...Knowing quality to them. "My name is Freya, by the way. You are welcome to keep this card in your possession. It will allow...Introspection. But I will take no offence if you prefer not to. I mean you no harm...But I also sense the wariness in you. An understandable disposition."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
People tended not to notice someone in a black cloak with red eyes? They weren't very observant then, were they? That type of garb combination tended to draw attention, in Ellesandra's experience. Her eyes turned down to the card again, not sure that she trusted it. It was obviously made with magic, but was it safer to take it herself, or let the woman take it with her? Either way was a risk, depending on how the woman's magic worked, and Ellesandra did not know anything about it. At least, if it was targeted at Ellesandra and she took it and it was some sort of trap, she knew she was relatively resistant to magic. With that consideration making the risk of this Freya taking it higher, she did reach and tentatively picked the card up. She raised it up to eye sight, tilting it to look at it for a moment, before nodding to Freya. "I will take it then, Freya." She could ask what exactly it was about herself that inspired Freya. She could also ask if it was typical for her to offer the card to people, or what introspection meant here, or how her magic worked. Ellesandra didn't, though. Instead, she continued watching the woman with a frown, only still here because she was still waiting for their food. "I will not have to deal with this card catching fire or something of the like during my travels, will I?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Freya gave a soft smile and shook her head. "Nothing of the sort, I assure you. Simply, the golden division in the middle of the card will shift left or right, revealing more of one side or the other, in balance with your own heart. For your eyes only. To all others, it will appear only as you saw it initially, until such time passes that it firmly cements on one half or the other." And as Ellesandra picked up the card and examined it while Freya spoke, what she said became reality. The card resonated with Ellesandra's heart, shifting one way or the other, though it could not go to either side fully just yet. Instead, a half inch or so to either extreme was its ending point. But what Ellesandra saw would depend on their own heart. Did they see themselves as a failure? A success? And to what degree? Would it shift all the way? Part of the way? It was still only Ellesandra's to see. "When the time comes, and the card has swayed fully to one side or the other, it will give an equally strong, yet differing boon to you. A magical strength, to be used only once. But only once your heart has become certain on which path you will walk."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When her eyes fell upon it with that explanation, holding it, she saw the shift. What was previously just the down the center, half and half of the card, suddenly the triumph side got smaller. It wasn't entirely gone, though it had shifted to where it only took up one quarter of the card's art space rather than the full half it had previously. The sign of the dungeon, the chains, made Ellesandra clench her jaw. She didn't quite know how she felt about this, but it made her uncomfortable. In reality, it scared her. It was like she told Star the other night - she didn't think she was anywhere close to being heroic. She had too much baggage weighing her down - chaining her down. The relation in the art and how she felt was bothersome. Seriously, first Star could see her emotions and now this damn card could see into her heart? It was almost as if the world was trying to force her to confront her past, when she very much did not want to. She lowered the card, planning to put it in her pack when she went back upstairs but for now slipping it into a pocket in her leggings. "A magical boon. That you give out for free. What are you getting from this? Will you be able to spy on us with this, get some sort of magic from me? Or perhaps your magical strength is strengthened by mine through daily contact?" Yes, Ellesandra wasn't exactly trusting - and this seemed like too good of a thing to just assume it was free.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "It is my duty. Seldom do I relinquish cards to others that have magic that can be used outside of the Spire, but when the calling of the card is to remain with the bearer of its inspiration, such is the result. I gain nothing for this. I will not observe you. In fact...It is the more likely result that you never see me again, unless it so happens that the Spire wills it. I do not blame you for your suspicions, of course. Those who tread a difficult path often greet fortune assuming it holds a dagger behind its back. I can tell you that no such ulterior motives exist in this gesture, but it makes little difference to me whether or not you believe me. Only that if you do walk away feeling that fortune has smiled upon you, I will be able to wear a smile. It would be nice, if I might be honest...To be able to finally make a positive difference in the life of another. But I shan't hold up your breakfast with a sob story."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Duty. That was the word that got her attention. She looked at the woman closer - obviously not a follower of Torm or anything of the like, but duty was still something that permeated many cultures and beliefs. Of course, there were some who believed in duty but still strayed from it, but somehow the woman just claiming it was her duty eased some suspicion. Oh, not all of the suspicion, but it eased the bit about whether or not Freya was getting anything from this. Sometimes you did things for duty not because you got something in return, but because it felt good to do what you were supposed to do. Ellesandra knew this well, and it was one of the main reasons she had signed herself up to Star without payment, knowing Star couldn't truly afford it. Who was she to look a gift horse in the mouth when she'd given a very similar gift to Star just recently? She still watched the woman curiously for a moment, but as she saw the waitress coming with her's and Star's plate, she would give Freya a nod. "Then I wish you a pleasant evening and that you have a smile on your face." She didn't actually consider this a positive experience - the card was too close to her truth and it wasn't encouraging. But, there was no need for Freya to know that, right? Unless Freya was someone who could tell when she was lying as well - admittedly, Ellesandra wasn't very good at it since she did it so rarely. She took the plates and balanced the two mugs in her hands, preparing to head back up to their room if Freya didn't say anything else or stop her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Freya had no reason to stop Ellesandra, though did look genuinely happy for the fleeting moments as Ellesandra walked away. Whatever the thoughts of the curious furry-eared woman were remained hers forevermore. She pulled the hood of her cloak back up, and resumed idly looking over the others who were sitting with a look of mild disinterest. When Ellesandra came back up, Star was sitting peacefully on the bed in quiet meditation, hair still damp from her shower. Ellesandra entering did break her from her meditation, however, and she greeted them with a smile, accepting her plate and juice when offered with a bit of a sweeter-than-usual smile. Star never let a thoughtful gesture go without its due appreciation. And so the usual balance of more veggies for Star and more meat for Ellesandra followed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet as the food was divvied up, but once she was sitting on the bed with the plate of food in her lap and eating, she did take a moment to pull out the card she had been given and toss it over next to Star. "Do you sense anything bad about this? A stranger gave it to me downstairs, it's magical and will apparently give me some sort of magical boon once one side or the other fully encompasses the card." She didn't need to explain that she didn't trust that way, most likely. She was interested in how it worked, even if she was wary of it, and she trusted Star plenty enough to look at it and tell her if the card was going to kill her or something. Or maybe not kill her, but if it had any less-than-good intentions within the magic. Like always, she said this between bites, eating otherwise like a very prim and proper lady would. Even while resting the plate on her legs, she was sitting up straight out of pure habit and could have easily been mistaken as a noble knight.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked and looked at the card when it was handed to her. She set her plate aside briefly and studied it. For a moment, she closed her eyes and her aura became visible. A swath of blue surrounded her, enveloping the card as well. She remained like this for some time before snapping out of her trance-like state with a jolt. Her brows knit together, then she looked at Ellesandra with some measure of uncertainty in her face. "Nothing bad, no. Just...Powerful. Very...Powerful. Entirely something that is up to the wielder of it, but it feels as though it won't respond to me. Like it will only respond to, well...You," she said, tilting her head. "Who was this stranger you met?" she asked as she held the card back out to Ellesandra. "This card it...The power inside it is...frighteningly strong. And locked behind a magical lock so potent that my magic would be but a whittled twig scratching against a castle wall made of adamantine. Whatever this magical boon is...I can be certain only that it will be yours to control, and that whoever gave this to you wasn't just...Some stranger."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra continued eating, silently watching Star as she began to examine the card. There was a concern that it would somehow trigger something and hurt Star, so Ellesandra was mindful to keep an eye on her and the card while she was examining it. When Star began explaining how powerful it was, Ellesandra took a deep breath and shook her head. "Someone named Freya, and she mentioned something about a Spire. I've not heard of her or anything like a Spire before, but I must be honest with you Star. Between you reading my emotions, Black Diamond being an overall ass, Sapphire joining Black Diamond in invading my dreams, and now this Freya person making a card with my likeness that is..." She paused, motioning to the card as if it was explanation itself. "I'm a little tired of supposedly extremely powerful beings invading on this journey. Deities and powerful beings can go fuck right off." All they wanted to do was find Star's mother, and rescue her from Black Diamond. Why was that so complicated? She speared a piece of sausage with her fork a little harder than was really necessary, wincing at the sound it made upon hitting the plate below it. "Sorry." She added, knowing that she'd included Star into that and not wanting to make her feel bad for a gift she couldn't control.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was pensive as Ellesandra responded. She ate quietly for a few moments, considering all that had happened. The stakes really hadn't seemed to be all that high on the grand scheme before. Nobody had really cared either way what she did. And now, suddenly that it seemed a plan was coming together, a path forward was being carved, it seemed everyone had something to say about it, and had to meddle in things. The annoyance sent her way certainly had its effect. Star always wore her emotions on her sleeve, and so the notion that she contributed to Ellesandra's emotional turmoil had her expression saddening rather pointedly. The apology eased it slightly, but the guilt was still crushing on her shoulders. She didn't say anything about it, her way of hopefully communicating that she didn't blame Ellesandra for their feelings. But the shame that something she couldn't control was negatively affecting Ellesandra was clear. Enough that she didn't have a verbal response to it, and she pointedly looked at her food rather than at her companion.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt guilt at how Star just didn't respond to her. It didn't take an emotional savant like Star to realize it was because she'd, in her mini rant, had commented about how much she disliked Star's ability to just read her. It was entirely true, but Star already knew that and it wasn't something she could just turn off, so pointing it out and making passive comments like she just did wasn't beneficial. She finished her own food in silence, sipping on her water, and as she finished she collected the mugs from last night and piled them all onto her plate with the water she'd been drinking that morning. As she passed back by Star, her hand came out and lightly brushed Star's shoulder. Not enough touch to really give the emotional connection time to do anything, but enough that Star would hopefully get the message of Ellesandra being sorry for the statement. She wasn't upset at Star herself, more just her power and the situation. It hadn't been a good idea to vent to a client anyways, though. A client shouldn't ever feel as if they were a burden to Ellesandra, and she had forgotten that for a moment. She'd prep things to get ready for their travel, letting the silence continue unless Star said anything else.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's hand rose up to hold Ellesandra's when it landed on her shoulder. She held it and gently squeezed, looking up at the other woman from her seat. She donned a small smile. Not enough to say everything was sunshine and rainbows, but just enough to say that they were okay. Star wasn't in distress or hurt, so the emotional barrier was stable and kept their hearts separated. "...I can handle the truth. And I'm glad you can say it. So...Even if it isn't nice to hear, I wanna hear it." Trying to be courageous in the face of painful words, it seemed. She didn't hold Ellesandra's hand long, just enough for her to speak her mind before releasing it again. She would still feel a bit bad, but that was okay to her. It was okay to feel bad. This too would pass.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It may be okay to feel bad, but that being layered on top of what had happened that morning with news from her mother too, Ellesandra just felt bad for piling it on. It didn't matter though - either way, they were going to be heading out. She collected her bag and put it back on her back, having been moved away sometime throughout the comforting earlier. The card was placed in it, careful not to bend or fold or damage it at all - the last thing she needed to do was accidentally offend another powerful magical being. She double checked, again, that they weren't missing anything, and then after Star was finished with her food would stack all of the plates and such so that she could carry it downstairs for the staff to clean without it being potentially forgotten up here for a while. She wouldn't rush Star, but after completing what she needed to prep the room for their departure, Ellesandra waited by the door patiently. She made sure not to look in Star's direction so that Star wouldn't feel rushed if she wasn't ready, simply standing and waiting like a practiced guard would.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was as eager if not more so than Ellesandra to head out, and she had been ready for a while. She still did not have a pack. Yet still was able to produce whatever she needed at will. Something that hadn't really been explained, yet remained true. Just little flickers of magic any time she needed to stow or withdraw something from...Wherever it was stored. She joined Ellesandra with a brief smile to them. "Northeast past the elven settlement, looking for some ruins I believe. Morrun marked my map with the approximate location, and it looks to be about a day's travel if we can secure a coach. By foot, probably about two, maybe three days."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded. "Best to get a coach if we have the funds for it. Not sure if we will be able to take it with us to Myst, but I'm sure you'll be happy to shave off as much time as possible - and with you not sleeping well last night a coach would be useful to keep us moving today." She wouldn't say it, but she had concerns about Star travelling hard and pushing herself too hard, considering her sudden rush to get there. The rush was understandable, but it was important she didn't wear herself out and make herself susceptible to danger on the travel. She opened the door holding their dishes and held the door open for Star to head out, then would begin following behind with the dishes. An immediate glance was given around when she got back down to the main room, both looking to see if Freya was still there, as well as to check for any other potential threats that had come in sense.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"After the five hundred Morrun paid us, we could coach halfway across the country and have a month's room and board left over at the finest inn," said Star with a giggle. "Coaches only run one copper per mile usually. We'd be silly to let money be what limits us on this," she said as they moved downstairs. No other threats had wandered into the inn, though Freya was still in the same place she was before, still cloaked and still idly looking at others in the area with disinterest. Eyes did flick to Ellesandra and a small smile met her lips, but her eyes no longer lingered. Her business with them was done, as far as she was concerned. Star's eyes, meanwhile, did naturally draw to Freya, and her gaze lingered on them for a short while. A look of sorrow overtook Star's face while she did so...Though she wouldn't let it hold her up. If Ellesandra was moving to exit, Star was right behind them to secure a coach, though she wouldn't hurry them along if they wanted to talk to Freya again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	That was true. She hadn't travelled with a coach as a customer in...had she ever? She'd assumed it was more expensive, but usually she was hired as a guard or something, never using them herself since she was comfortable walking and had never been in a rush. Now, though, they could definitely get a coach. Ellesandra walked up to the bar to return their plates and their key and making a quick inquiry as to where they could hire a coach. Best to get the directions from someone local, rather than trying to just roam the entire city looking. With directions, she turned and would give Freya a simple nod while heading out of the inn. She didn't notice the look of sorrow from Star, not being as in tune with recognizing emotion changes and not having been paying special attention to Star, versus their surroundings. Despite the reassurance from Star that the pirates were being controlled and they weren't really seeing pirates around town right now, Ellesandra was still on guard, eyes turning this way and that as they exited the Inn, and began making their way to the coach. "A coach is especially good because you may be able to get some sleep on it, as long as you don't get motion sickness. If you think you can relax enough to do so, that is. I can help take shifts with the driver if he needs a break as well."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The nod was met with another small smile. Fate would decide if this would be the last time the two would meet, but for now they parted amicably. The innkeeper was happy to direct Ellesandra to the trade center of the city which was in the northeast section of the pier. Coaches as well as sea-based trade services were available there at a typical rate, as one might expect of a moderately sized settlement as Cloverport. Star spoke up as they began on their way: "I can imagine you feel more at home on the back of a horse than in a seat behind them, but also I think it's fine to just let the driver set the pace. The horses will need time to drink and rest all the same, so as much as I know it goes against your base instincts, maybe try and relax a little? Not that I really have much place to talk on that front, I suppose.."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded. "Yes, I'm comfortable on a horses back, but I wouldn't be riding them if controlling the coach anyways." What she WOULD be is outside of the coach to keep a better eye out. The problem with being inside of the coach was her ability to keep an eye out for danger was severely limited. Despite Star encouraging her to just take some time to try and relax, all that was going on with these gems - which she was including Sapphire as one because her damn name was a gem too - made her untrusting of being able to let her guard down. There had been a note that while in Myst, they'd be safer from the gems, but until they got to Myst? Still in danger, and Myst surely had it's own dangers in and of itself. "I'll relax some, but I may take some time to keep pace outside of the carriage to keep an eye out too." It would be good exercise, anyways. Most coaches tended to go at a fast walk pace, or slightly slower, so it would be a decent way to stretch her legs and ensure that she didn't get too stiff while sitting in the coach. Another way to stretch her still slightly sore muscles after the haste spell the other day.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled. "Well, leave it to you to find any excuse to work yourself harder," she said with playful chiding in her tone. "But let it not ever be said you aren't diligent," she followed up, sincere as could be. She never needed a reason to try and uplift Ellesandra, it seemed. The trip over to secure a coach would be without incident; no pirates to be seen, people getting back to their lives, the elves having long since departed, and it was almost as if nothing had ever happened. Certainly, some things were in the works at the upper levels. Perhaps the local lord might have some reaction to the series of events, but overall, things seemed more peaceful for their intervention now. People seemed happier. Less on edge. Though nobody recognized Star or Ellesandra or their part in all of this, the effects were clear. A good deed had been done. Lives were made better. Life could go on without fear for the immediate future, and the woes became all the more mundane. The coach service had idle drivers to spare, and a standard agreement was easy to achieve. The destination on the map did confirm it would take about a day to reach the nearest point on the main road that was near the site of interest. They would arrive, all things going well, a few hours after dusk to be dropped off.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She wasn't finding an excuse to work herself harder. She was doing her job. Typical work, not working herself harder. At least, that's how she saw it. She let Star lead the discussion in getting the coach, more standing by and looking around at the area as they discussed business. It was great to see the town starting to get back onto it's feet, even if she was a little wary of everything still. It felt like the result was too good, and Ellesandra was waiting for the shoe to drop. Then again, ever since meeting Star, her life had been turned upside down so that was a reasonable expectation. Still, nothing seemed to happen. On the ride, Ellesandra alternated between walking alongside the carriage, especially at first when they were closer to town, and riding in the carriage. The ride was nice, to give herself a break, but even while riding her eyes were mostly glued to the window, using the little bit of view of the road outside she had to keep watch that way. She had been used to walking alongside one, or riding a horse alongside, the entire way, but she wanted to ensure she too was entirely up to a fight if one needed to be had. She'd mostly recovered from the haste spell, but a long day hiking on foot at a coach's pace, while possible, would strain her endurance more than it should have. A bleak reminder that she'd not kept up with the diligent training she should have, in the past few years. Still, during the travel she was mostly silent, though not against talking if Star spoke, Ellesandra didn't offer anything up herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star would make small talk along the way. Little bits, pointing out some pretty wildlife she spied, talking about how it was fortunate the storm that looked to be approaching Cloverport had diverted and missed them...Nothing of consequence, and nothing overbearing. Silence was allowed to be maintained, and Star took some time to meditate as best she could. Some bumps in the road did make it troublesome, but she did manage a little time. She also napped for about an hour and a half along the way during one of the stretches. As uneventful as trips went, truly. But there was plenty of excitement surely to come. Their destination reached, two silver parted from their inventory, and the coach was off to make some headway back to the city before making a camp for the night. Amicably parted, business concluded, the two now had to decide if they would make camp in the wild or push on through the night. The map marker showed their destination was vaguely an hour or so through some wooded areas to reach the ruins in question; there were some lightly traveled forest paths among the trees, but a paranoid adventurer may choose instead to walk paths not traveled, with some loss of time for trudging through more untamed wilderness.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Small talk was somehow worse for Ellesandra. To her, it was pointless conversation, whereas other topics with a purpose or meaning she could get behind. Still, she never shut Star down when she was talking, at the very least giving a listening ear if not being super responsive. As they made it to their destination and got off, she was thankful they'd gone for the coach. Not only did it mean it had been progress while still resting, but it also meant they got there in just one day versus if they had walked and taken multiple nights to do so. She looked around and motioned into the woods, keeping an eye out for sign of wildlife or beasts or anyone who might be nearby. "Why don't we get a bit inside, away from the road so we won't be a target, and set up camp there? Might be able to find a river or something to camp nearby with the remaining light we have now." She wouldn't recommend going to the ruins tonight, if only because the trip would be hazardous and they didn't know what to expect, but she also would follow Star's lead. It wasn't too risky, to the point that Ellesandra would stop Star, she'd just recommend otherwise.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could catch onto Ellesandra's annoyance at the small talk. It certainly diminished the amount she was going to engage in, and would affect how much she would going forward. It didn't bother her. She could adapt. When they did arrive, she deferred to Ellesandra's advisory. "Sounds like a plan to me," she said simply while doing an idle stretch, then prepared to move with Ellesandra. There wouldn't be any fresh water sources along the way unfortunately, but there were some places that served as securable places to rest with natural overhangs to huddle up against, and dry foliage to burn that wouldn't smoke for a campfire. Star would prove to have plenty of water if Ellesandra ran out, pulling it out of, once more, seemingly nowhere. That Star was an arcane adept made clear she certainly had plenty of talents Ellesandra did not yet know about, and while she wasn't out to bore Ellesandra with all of her capabilities, she also certainly would be resistant to explaining if asked.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had only consult Star's map for a moment to confirm there weren't any water sources nearby. Rather than trying to find one then, she did lead them through to find a nice, defensible and out of the way place to set up camp. Ellesandra made no complaint about doing most or all of the work to get the camp setup. She wouldn't stop Star from doing anything, but she also didn't expect it of her. She'd pull her pack off and then look over to Star, since this was the first time they'd be camping on the road together since meeting. "Do you have a tent or a bedroll in that magical bag of yours?" She'd ascertained the bag was magical, though of what means Ellesandra had no idea. Was Star simply storing a lot in a small space, or was she creating things as she pulled stuff out? Ellesandra had no idea, but she also didn't ask. There was curiosity there, but unless it was information that would be pertinent to their travels, like if Star had camping supplies, she wouldn't. It had become the norm to let her client do as they will and just support or provide as needed, even if she'd already gotten closer to Star than any client recently. "I've got a tent that would fit both of us, but I'm afraid I don't have an extra bedroll. And it may be beneficial for two tents if you have one, for your meditation."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I have my own tent and bedroll, but, erm, I don't know how to say this in a way that doesn't sound a little peculiar, but if it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to share a tent, if there's space for both of us. You see, erm...When we're in a settlement it's less a concern, which is why I hadn't really said anything, but out in the wilderness it's more pertinent." A bit of rambling, but she did seem to be circling the point, whatever it was. "I'm able to...Feel your presence in my sleep if I'm close. It helps me relax, as I'd be able to feel distress if something happened in the night. It's not the same as emotional transference that happens while I'm conscious of course, just...Think of it like an alarm, I suppose. If you find the notion uncomfortable, I won't press the matter! I just, well..." She blushed a little, here, looking away from Ellesandra as one foot bashfully twisted in place back and forth while hands folded behind her. "It would help me feel more at ease. N-No pressure, again. I promise."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra came up short at this request. She turned to look at Star, a curious and also conflicted expression on her face. On the one hand, Star was proposing it for an entirely logical reason. If Ellesandra being alerted nearby in the tent would alert Star too, that was beneficial. On the other hand, was that really so limited as to not work if they were in two different tents next to one another instead of in the same tent? Being in the same tent would run the risk of Star cuddling up close, which Ellesandra wasn't sure she was comfortable with while sleeping or not initiating it herself. It also ran the risk of Ellesandra having a nightmare, and Star being worried about her in regards to it. For something to do here and there until they got a second tent was one thing; as something to do every night on the road made Ellesandra a little concerned. "You aren't able to feel my presence if I'm keeping watch while at the fire, or in my own tent?" Was it a line of sight thing? That actually seemed like the most likely thing. "I -" There was a spike of embarrassment. A guardedness of...not wanting Star to see her when she had a nightmare. Not wanting to have to explain most of all, but also just the vulnerability of that. Still, Star wouldn't just accept a no, either. "I also have nightmares, sometimes. I'm a little afraid I might hurt you in my sleep during them. That, or ruin both of our nights of sleep with it." Neither of those comments and questions were a no, though. She was stating issues, concerns with the idea, but she hadn't refused Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Remember the vision I showed you? The memory of my childhood? My mom was talking about my aura sense, then. That time it was to detect a most dapper and honourable squirrel of course, but...When I'm conscious, I have a passive sense for auras around me, a sense that I can amplify if I focus on it. How far I can spread that sense varies, thin objects like a tent don't affect it much, thick walls impede it a little more but...It's mostly a matter of proximity. Unless you can think of a way to mush our tents up right next to each other so there's only a few feet between us, it wouldn't really have the desired effect." The implication being that if they DID know some way to fuss that, there'd be no issue. Properly securing the pitons for the tent did usually require a bit of berth around them, however, which made such a thing difficult to imagine. She of course noticed the spike in embarrassment and guardedness, however, so she rose her hands in a defensive posture. "O-Of course, I really do mean it that there's no pressure. I...Uhm. I could also..." She paused to consider what she was about to say, then shook her head. "N-Never mind. Just. Know that if you did have a nightmare, I would wake before you started hurting me, and could wake you in turn, if that...Helps, at all." She was tip-toeing around this issue, that much was obvious. She did desire it, but she knew this was pushing Ellesandra's boundaries, and she seemed very nervous to do so.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The words 'a most dapper and honorable squirrel' caused Ellesandra's mouth to twitch a bit. She almost smiled, though held it back - even if Star could see the obvious amusement in her emotions creep up a little. There was still caution, concern about doing this, but there was also...acceptance. No, Ellesandra wasn't aware of a way they could safely mush their tents up next to eachother, and really if she thought about it, Star would probably be hearing her on the nights she had a nightmare anyways. Maybe it would be better if it was a situation where Star could wake her up before it got too deep? Especially if either of the gems decided to partake in said nightmare, not that they seemed inclined to do so right now. There were a few moments of silence where Ellesandra just watched Star, indecision on her face, but then she turned and began setting up her tent. She didn't speak until it was out of her bag, set up, and she'd thrown her own bedroll inside near the entrance to the tent. It was a two person tent, so spacious enough for them to both lay down with a little bit of wiggle room, but it certainly wasn't spacious. After throwing her bedroll in, she motioned to the tent with her head. "Go ahead and set yourself up in there." An admission, to let this happen. There was already an inkling of regret, mostly fueled by anxiety at the situation and what she might dream of. But Star had a good point, and her safety was the priority.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star saw the amusement, because of course she did. And that amusement begot some amusement in Star, evoking a little grin that silently said 'I saw that'. Amusement turned to curiosity and uncertainty as Ellesandra just...Set about setting up their tent without saying anything. Was that a good sign? A bad sign? Star almost spoke up to ask, but thought better of it, and elected to just stew in her own uncertainty and stand around uselessly for it. Setting up a tent did take a short while, so Star had plenty of time to be a bundle of anxiety until Ellesandra gave her the invitation in. She blinked. "Wh...Really?" A question and look of surprise that said she genuinely did not expect her request to be granted. With a smile and nod however, she moved over to the tent. A shimmer of white light flowed from either of her palms, forming into a vague cylinder between them. And from nothing, her bedroll came to exist. A bedroll made of sturdy material on the bottom, with plush silk inner lining on what was an enchanted outer layer of cloth to drape over herself, complete with a down pillow. Combined with the dress Star wore that never seemed to be able to stay dirty, and that Star had always carried a breezy, floral scent never once tinted with unpleasant odors, magic was the only answer to the question of how this woman maintained all of these things. Most bedrolls were obviously made for one, but this one seemed more spacious. Enough that it ensured their two bedrolls would be pressed together in the less spacious tent. Hers wasn't big enough for two people to fit with room to sprawl, but just eyeballing the size, one could see room for two if they snuggled close. Star obviously wasn't drawing attention to this fact as she laid the bedroll out, as she...Attempted to keep some distance between their two bedrolls. A little mushing of hers against the edge of the tent afforded about an inch of space between the two bedrolls, which she seemed satisfied with as she turned back to smiled at Ellesandra. A thankful smile, certainly.
</p>
 
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had nodded at the surprise and was about to turn away, to start making the fire, when she saw the white light out of the corner of her eye. She paused, staring at the shimmer of white light between Star's palms, and then the apparent creation of a bedroll. That didn't look like it was just a magical bag; that looked like it was full on Star just magically creating a bedroll. And it looked comfortable as hell - definitely more so than the basic bedroll you can get at any general store that Ellesandra had. Her eyebrows raised as she watched Star try to fit it into the tent, and then when she pulled out to look at Ellesandra she'd see a mixture of more amusement, and curiosity. "Just so I know, in case it becomes useful in the future, did I just see you make that bedroll or is that some kind of storage spell I'm not aware of? The bedroll isn't going to be destroyed by me absorbing magic I touch if I accidentally stretch my arm out onto it or something, will it?" That would be amusing. Stretching her arm out in her sleep and draining the magic, if it tried to directly interact with Ellesandra herself that is. Then poof no bedroll for Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star tilted her head at the question, then smiled, hands folded neatly behind her back. "I can do both. That was just a simple manipulation of extradimensional space, though." Ah, yes, of course. How could Ellesandra not know? "Erm. That is. Storage. It's a common magic taught in my homeland, the ability to create a magical space that you can use to store things and retrieve at will. But that bedroll is something that was created for me by an old friend. It's weatherproof and warm. And, erm, not that I expect you to take me up on the offer, but just in case the desire ever does strike you, it can fit two." And before Ellesandra could respond to that, she went on from there: "But as for creating things, I can do that too, to some degree. Particularly with water, if you ever need some, that is easy to conjure."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
So it was storage, not creation. She nodded, one eyebrow raising up her forehead at the invitation to share the bedroll, then the quick change of topic immediately afterwards. More amusement, though also some...caution, there. Flirting with, or responding to Star flirting with her, was definitely off the table. She'd gone and learned her lesson with her last permanent charge. Getting too close to Star felt...well, Ellesandra would never admit it to herself, but it was fear. Fear that something like that would happen again - even if Star was different from Marigold in that she wasn't exactly off limits. "I don't think I'll be taking you up on that anytime soon, Miss Lumina." She smirked when she addressed star via a proper name. It was a joke, to make light of how Ellesandra was refusing to get close to her both physically and emotionally. She wasn't actually going to continue using it, and hoped that doing that would stop any potential sting her words might have if Star was secretly hoping otherwise. "And that is good to know with water. Can you make food to? We still ought to use the food Morrun and Lissana provided to us now, but if we're ever in a situation where we are running low on supplies, it will be nice to know what you can provide and what I'll need to hunt for."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took the joke as it was and offered a pout in response. She looked aside and moved one hand up, idly twirling a bit of her hair. "I'm not inviting you to SLEEP with me you know.." she said through her pouty look, using the more obvious sexual implication of 'sleep'. "I'm just saying it's comfy, and as much as you're the total opposite, I like to cuddle, even just as friends. It's comforting." She huffed through her nose, still sporting the light air about her as her hand moved back to join the other and she refocused on more practical matters. "I can create food, but it's much more taxing than just water. If I'm tapped out, I won't be able to do that at least until the next morning. But when I do do it, it at least is a good quantity. Way more than we'd need. But it perishes after a day. It's all bland, too. So as much as possible, I try to live off the land. Still. It's proven very useful when traversing barren lands."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra gave Star a serious look, waiting until after the explanation on creating food before saying "I would be more comfortable fucking you than cuddling with you, even if that would be a bad idea considering how we handle things differently." The knight wasn't joking with this, and wanted to make it clear to Star. The type of thing that they'd done that morning, with Ellesandra holding Star, was FAR out of her comfort zone - especially with the emotional connection that happened when they touched. She wasn't the type to cuddle with a friend, or even a lover, not since she'd closed herself off. It was a vulnerability and an emotional connection that Ellesandra, for the most part, no longer wanted. That being said, Star was obviously very different. She'd said she'd not been with anyone, for one. Even if Ellesandra hadn't known that, it was obvious Star cared about a connection with someone. Maybe it would be assuming and basing it off of her kindness and how much she wanted to connect with people, and also maybe Ellesandra was creating an excuse because she was afraid of having that intimacy, but still. She began pulling out the meats that had been packaged away, the things that might go bad first, and setting about putting her mess kit up over a fire. "Do you have preferences for food?" A topic change, but one that would hopefully prevent any awkwardness after her blunt statement.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	A blunt statement it certainly was. The crass words evoked a raise of Star's brows and a visible flinch. One needn't put a hand to her chest to see that her heart rate almost certainly spiked upon hearing that. She hadn't expected to evoke that kind of reaction, and much as Ellesandra tried to just shift topics, that one was going to stick with her for a while. Star wasn't the kind of person who could just push down her emotions and pretend like nothing happened. No, no. Her knightly friend was the expert on that. So it was with a lower volume and downtrodden voice that she responded. "I know you prefer meat, I prefer fruits and vegetables." That much had been obvious fairly quickly. "Whatever is going to go bad first takes priority though. I'm not picky."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She would grab one of the slabs of meat - a smaller one, and went about setting up a makeshift grill over the fire. She noticed the obvious down voice from Star, but she didn't know how to address it. It hadn't been anything wrong with Star herself preventing Ellesandra from wanting to cuddle, more just that she didn't want to overall, with anyone. Star likely knew that, but there was still a spot of guilt and...shame, for being how she was. She didn't regret saying that though; it was the truth and drawing that line was necessary if they were going to be sharing a tent. It was entirely likely that Star would feel worse if she had moved over to cuddle Ellesandra through the night only to feel how much Ellesandra didn't want that, and think it was her. Or not? Ellesandra didn't know, this was all too complicated. She told the truth, that's all that mattered right? Ellesandra ended up cooking that single slab of meat and using nuts to lightly coat it and add some texture, along with fruits. If Star didn't say anything while she cooked, the next time Ellesandra would speak or even look at her was when handing over a plate of a small portion of the meat, and most of the nuts layered atop and around the meat with the majority of the fruit on the side of it - Ellesandra obviously having taken less of it. "I will be keeping an eye out while the sun goes down, but we can hit the bedrolls whenever you want to. It might be better to start towards the ruins early, but if we go too early we might miss who we're looking for if they're sleeping in their own camp somewhere."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't have much else to say. She learned her lesson about small talk, and there was a lingering dimness to her expression in the wake of hearing the truth. She didn't seem upset by Ellesandra or the state of things. She said herself she knew they weren't going to accept. She offered anyway, because offers and openness was just who she was. But something about how it came out still seemed to sting and put a dour mood in the air. Star ate in silence, offering only a small smile in thanks when it was prepared. Naturally, she ensured the plates balanced in that Ellesandra got the lion's share of the meat since she got the rest. Once she was done, she waited for Ellesandra to finish as well while sitting nearby. Her index finger on her right hand then lit up with a soft cerulean light that exuded tiny flecks of white. She touched her finger to her plate, then Ellesandra's. A small flash of dim light shone on each plate, sending motes of white light up a few inches into the air where they then dissipated to nothing. In the wake of this tiny magic, plates and utensils were spotless. Safe to assume some similar magic was used to keep her clothes so pretty and pristine. "I'm tired, admittedly. I'll be off to bed, then." Unless Ellesandra had reason for her to stay, she did rise and move to get herself comfy in bed, ending the night with the lingering mood of not really upset, but not really happy either.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let the silence stretch as she ate, enjoying it but also feeling bad for it. It was weird, returning to what would be considered the expected of her own preferences, but knowing that this silence was because Star's feelings were hurt made her feel bad. She hadn't meant it to hurt Star's feelings, but even someone as emotionally stunted as herself could tell that Star didn't feel great about it. Still, silence passed as they ate, and when they were done and Star used magic to clean up the plates, Ellesandra nodded. "Thank you. Sleep well, Star." Polite, moving to pack up the plates and mess kit back up while Star headed into the tent. Star needed the sleep, after having not slept well earlier and only getting a bit of a nap on the road, so even if Ellesandra had wanted to talk more she wouldn't have stopped Star. Instead, though, she sat out by the fire as it died down, looking around for a moment, then digging in her backpack until she pulled out a small wittling knife. She'd look around for a good piece of wood to use, then would sit near the fire and slowly begin to wittle away at it. A way to keep her hands busy and mind focused on that, rather than the past, or the conversation with Star. Eventually, she would ensure the fire was completely out, her armor removed and set in the corner of the tent near her side, and slip in to rest as well, careful to stay on her side and try not to wake Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was swift to fall asleep. She slept peacefully, as she always did. No snoring, no strange noises. Just the quiet sound of her breathing, occasionally with a little sleeping sigh. Noticeably, however, she had seemed just slightly tense in the lips and eyes before Ellesandra approached. But once they were in the bed near Star? The tension left her. She seemed...Content again. Even in her sleep, it seemed she could tell if Ellesandra was nearby, though it was likely all in her subconscious mind. It might be that if Ellesandra got up again and walked away, Star might be disturbed. Time would tell. Meanwhile, Ellesandra it seemed wasn't due to have a normal slumber. Not even the expected void realm awaited her. Instead, something else entirely. There was lucidity, an awareness of the dream state. But this time, it didn't feel like a pull. It didn't feel like something snatching Ellesandra away from normality. It didn't feel like an outside influence. It didn't feel like the shadow, or like Sapphire. It felt...Natural. And in this dream, Ellesandra was wearing a tight, full-white fencing suit. Below them was a slightly raised fencing piste. Ellesandra was standing at the far edge on their side, and standing opposite Ellesandra was their opponent. Their opponent stood equal in height, and was similarly left-handed, or at least was wielding their foiled epee with their left hand for this duel. They had a feminine figure, but there was a veiled helmet obscuring their face and hair. Ellesandra had a typical fencing mask under their right arm, pinned between arm and torso, to put on when they were ready. In their left hand, a matching foiled epee. The blunted tip was coated in red chalk, and there was an expected platform next to the piste at either end with more chalk to coat the weapon's tip if needed. Alongside the piste were three unlit, standing torches per side. Three for Ellesandra, three for their opponent. The area beyond the piste was visible out to a handful of meters, illuminated by unseen light from above. Wooden flooring. The walls of this space, or what was beyond, were obscured in darkness. Ellesandra's opponent held their epee up straight before them, patiently awaiting as Ellesandra finished their preparations. And as Ellesandra was doing so, another figure walked up, coming from the edge of the shadows, to observe the match. The clack of their boots against the wooden flooring announced their presence. And as they stepped out of the light, the recognition would be instantaneous. It was none other than Sia, who looked at Ellesandra, then their opponent, then back to Ellesandra. Sia watched with a stern, neutral expression, waiting for Ellesandra to be ready and face their opponent.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra had noticed the seeming relaxation from Star when she entered the tent. Why would her presence make Star feel better? She had travelled alone, without Ellesandra or her other guardian for a while now, hadn't she? Ellesandra hadn't let herself dwell on that long, instead going to sleep with her back facing Star pretty quickly. When she felt herself move into a dream state, but could TELL she was dreaming, she looked around in confusion. Was this Black Diamond's doing? It took a few moments to take in all the details - her opponent, masked and wielding her weapon in her left hand. Her eyes narrowed, wondering if that was Marigold. She hadn't had a dream about Marigold outside of the incident in...years. Let alone dreaming about fighting her - was it because she'd thought of that recently, when explaining her use of the rapier to Star? She looked down at her own helmet, then up as Sia stepped in to apparently officiate the fight. There had been fear that the fighter across from her was Marigold, but that wasn't confirmed so it was more just trepidation. But when Ellesandra saw Sia, standing tall on the side of the field, close-cut black and grey hair that defined the words salt and pepper, looking out over both of them naturally, her stomach dropped like a bail of hay from the top of a stable loft. Ellesandra's mouth opened, then closed. She hadn't seen Sia since just before her punishment, when her mentor had talked the King and Queen down from sending Ellesandra to the gallows for hanging. She remembered the look, the disappointment in her gaze, and how Sia had only looked at her briefly, unable to maintain eye contact. So ashamed of Ellesandra's failure that she couldn't even look at her student. "Ma-" Ellesandra began to speak, more in a whisper, but Sia cut her off. "What are you doing, El? Get your helmet on and take your stance, we don't have time to dawdle and stare." The words came out sharp, commanding. A scold for Ellesandra not being prepared to start the fight in a timely manner, for not having her mind in the game. There had been more than once she'd received the same scolding when she'd been distracted before a practice bout. The familiarity of it was nice, even if seeing Sia still brought back the shame, the guilt, and...a different kind of pain. It wasn't the pain of losing Marigold - there was that, but it was minimal from the sight of Sia alone. It wasn't that Sia reminded her of Marigold, but that she'd lost the respect and faith of someone she'd looked up to her whole life. It was the closest thing she knew, in memory anyways, to losing a mother. Ellesandra's mouth closed and she felt the sharp sting of tears. New grief was coming to the surface - she'd never dreamed about Sia before, only Marigold. In the real world, there was a very quiet whimper from the knight - a sound she would never make when conscious. But she didn't have time to wallow in that; Sia turned fully towards her when Ellesandra hadn't snapped to attention to follow orders. "Ellesandra Rhinelander, you will stand tall, put your helmet on, and take your fighting stance, or it will be I in the ring with you and I will not hold back." That was a real threat. It was the punishment for students who did not follow orders; they would be reminded why they needed their training. Why Sia was their teacher, and what dedicating themselves to training could do for them. And they always left bruised and battered. Instinct and habit had Ellesandra straightening, placing the helmet on her head and turning to face her opponent. A glance was stolen at Sia out of the corner of her eye, but there didn't appear to be any comment or reference to the last time they'd seen eachother. Without another word, afraid to test even the dream version of her mentor, she stepped forward in the ring, walking to the middle with the weapon raised in front of her as was protocal and standard in polite bouts.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The bout was certainly to be a polite, proper, and official one. Ellesandra's opponent moved in lockstep, so that their approach to each other was mirrored and in perfect harmony. A little ceremony to the duel. The foils were held with the guards just below the head, out just a few inches, foils raised straight up as they approached. The opponent stopped precisely where they were meant to, precisely four meters away from Ellesandra's en garde line, then turned with a tight swivel of the heel, saluted Sia, then turned back to face Ellesandra, saluted them, then extended their right hand to shake one firm shake. Respect, chivalry, honour. These were all exemplified in this duel, as they should be. All up to a code that would be up to Sia's standards. Assuming Ellesandra could manage the same, the two were prepared for Sia to officiate and call for En Garde, ready, and begin. The warning areas were clearly marked with orange paint on the piste, with the area beyond the warning naturally resulting in a touch for the opponent if pushed back into it. Rules that doubtlessly would come back to Ellesandra like second nature, though between the unexpected presence of the officiate in question and the nature of what all this was or meant, Ellesandra's focus might be tested.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra walked out onto the field like she was trained to do. Once the muscle memory kicked in, it was easy for her to follow orders and do what was expected of her. Her mind was racing, wondering what this dream was that she was so lucid during it. Was it a creation of the Black Diamond? Seeing Sia treat her normally meant it wasn't something where Sia was aware of what was going on in present time. If she was, there would have been a much different interaction there. She turned in time to salute, but her turn back was stiff and slower than it should have been. Sia did not say anything, but in the back of her mind the 'shit' that would have been said to herself if this were real came back up. Sia might not say something about every small mistake, every move that was out of sync, but she'd make note of them, and they would be brought up later. As a duel was about to start wasn't the best place to bring up something 'minor', even though her mentor would still drill it into her not to miss it no matter how minor it was. Ellesandra took the moment of entering her stance to try to recover and focus on whoever her opponent was. Well, not who because if Ellesandra kept guessing it being Marigold simply from the left handedness and training with this type of weapon, she would make herself go crazy. But to focus on her opponent, get herself into a fighting mindset, be prepared to fight as if this were a real training duel - and to win, like she always strove to do.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sia called out the expected phrases. En garde. Ready. Begin! Said by rote, official and rigid. The duel began, and the masked opponent gave a half second before tapping foil on foil, mostly as a signal of honour that they would not be capitalizing on a blitz or trying to take Ellesandra off guard with a cheap hit. If they were going to score, the subtlety to their actions certainly suggested they wanted it to be well-earned. As the motions began, the initial bout was fierce. Ellesandra's opponent met step for step, not giving any mercy but also not taking any cheap tactics like how some might tap their front foot to distract their opponent. Parries were met with attempts to riposte, but each strike, while well-practiced and refined, was a near miss. Ellesandra would feel the pressure. Their opponent was focused. They were capable. The bout was a back and forth of excellent motions, near-flawless movement and focused strikes. It looked like neither would get the upper hand, until one such time that Ellesandra's opponent went in for a feint, then a strike, only to have their feint be met with readiness for their strike to then be parried, opening them to a full hit from Ellesandra on the torso to leave a tiny red mark on their white jacket. The masked opponent nearly was able to evade, but just barely could not. They noticed the hit, stood straight, and extended their hand to shake again before moving back to their en garde line, turning to face Ellesandra again and begin the next bout. At this hit, one torch on Ellesandra's side of the piste burst with flames as it ignited, marking one point for Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra responded just as honorably as her opponent for the rituals. Light tap, the hand shake, all of it. As confused as Ellesandra was, and as surprised as she was to see Sia, she had spent years of her life in the training ground like this. She didn't even have to think for most of these movements to flow naturally, and she appreciated that her opponent also seemed to respect the tradition. As the fight began, Ellesandra was impressed with her opponents demeanor. She enjoyed the exchange, the give and take of a very close bout, and the pride at getting the upper hand in the end. Ellesandra truly enjoyed bouts like this, and despite the grief and shame that were still there everytime she saw Sia, there was also joy and the content feeling of the adrenaline rush in a fight. As she was declared the victor, she stepped back and ensured there was enough of the red substance at the end of her dulled blade before taking stance again. As long as she didn't look at Sia, she was fine. The sound of Sia declaring her victory was comforting and brought back many memories similar - though Ellesandra had lost plenty too. At this next set of en garde and starting rituals, Ellesandra tried to push all of that from her mind and focused on one singular thing - the duel.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The next bout began same as the first. Ellesandra's movements had settled into more routine now that the training was rushing back to them, perhaps, but the result was more predictable, if successful tactics. Conversely, their masked opponent seemed to have become shaken by the loss of the first point when they had performed so admirably. Enough that their aggression was faltering, and they focused more on the defense. This, in turn, had a predictable outcome. As they stepped back more and more to wait patiently for a mistake in Ellesandra's movements, they found none, and were pushed onto the warning line, where they were forced to either go on the offense and expose themselves, or step back in defense and lose anyway. They elected for the offense, however, but the desperate attack was all too predictable. It was still executed with competence, but with Ellesandra keeping their training in mind and performing in the vague range of 'above average' for their performance in such duels, it was a foregone conclusion once the defensive posture did not work to the opponent's favour. Another point for Ellesandra. Another shake of the hand, and another return to the en garde lines.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She'd found her groove. This time she only looked at Sia out of the expectation of confirming the call, of making the honorifcs, and moving back to their spot. Their body was humming with energy - not magical, but the type of energy you got when you were in your element. It had been so long since she'd dueled like this, not for fighting or protecting, but just to exercise her body and test her limits. She'd gotten rusty since she'd last done it, and Ellesandra knew this. Sia probably knew it, but she was winning and she felt good about that. That emotion took up everything in her, serving as a distraction coping mechanism, letting her focus entirely on the duel, and stepping forward into her opponent to try and gain the winning hit.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The tide of the duel was clear. The masked opponent was being respectful, taking their loss with grace and honour, but by the third bout? It wasn't even a contest. Their resolve had been shattered. Their repeated attempts to score a hit all being met with perfect parries and effortless dodging killed their confidence and let doubts creep in. It had grown to such a divide that the third bout lasted less than ten seconds. Strike, step, parry, and passado. Ellesandra was able to end the final bout in record time, and their opponent accepted their defeat with grace, a handshake, then set their foil down horizontally across the piste along the center line. Not really a formal or familiar motion, but a sign of complete surrender and defeat. Their masked opponent then removed their mask, and perhaps to Ellesandra's confusion, perhaps horror...It was Ellesandra staring back at them. A bruised, defeated, crestfallen Ellesandra. The image of the knight from the card Freya had created staring back at the real knight. "Congratulations," said Ellesandra's defeated self. "You fought with discipline. I'd wager we could go for a hundred rounds and I'd be lucky to score ten hits." At these words, the final of the three torches ignited on Ellesandra's side. Then, torches all around the realm of dreams ignited, showing the rectangular room for what it was. Wooden floors, stone walls, and blood spattered all around the floors that were cut up, scorched, and strewn with skeletal remains, some in armor, with cobwebs plenty scattered around. The image of a ruined castle all around them. But about one quarter of the room was different; behind a large, golden plane of shimmering magic, the one quarter of the room beyond this golden divider was clean, pristine, immaculate. And another version of Ellesandra stood on the far side of this barrier, clad in a brilliant, resplendent set of silver armor that was far more intricate than Ellesandra's typical armor. A masterwork set, with her trusty rapier at her side. Hair up in the usual ponytail, and a firm, solid look upon her face. The...Triumphant Ellesandra, it seemed, who was very gently applauding from her sequestered section beyond the veil, which was quite a bit more cramped than the decrepit, ruined castle that was home to the defeated Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did not enjoy this third round as much. Sure, she still won, but there was less victory in it. Her opponent had already been defeated mentally before they'd even touched blades, and it showed. The quick defeat and surrender did not instill the joy and excitement, the adrenaline, that the other two bouts had - especially that first one, which had been so close. And as her opponent removed her mask, Ellesandra stiffened, preparing for the worst. Would this turn into a nightmare? It probably wasn't Black Diamond's doing, or they would have somehow made it so that Ellesandra had killed Marigold. That's probably what would have happened in her nightmare too, come to think of it, so what? When she saw herself, Ellesandra took a step back in surprise. Shock was on her face and she looked around in confusion as the area changed and they were suddenly in...a castle? No, it looked more like a dungeon, at least for most of it, but then she saw the other side of the room where there was another version of her, much better armored and apparently happy, smiling, and applauding. It took a few moments for all the sights to make sense, and for her to realize that this was the card she'd been carrying - not a dream. "Oh for fucks sake!" The frustration made her roll in her sleep, arm being flung out up and to the side. In the small tent, it was inches from touching Star's cheek, but dream Ellesandra didn't know this. She was looking between the defeated and triumphant versions of herself. "Can I not own my own damn mind? First I have gems taking it over, then I have a damn card from a stranger I don't know? What is it you want?" She asked this of the versions of herself because - well. Who else was she going to ask? She didn't see Freya anywhere nearby. She swept her arm out to encompass the both of them, moving just enough in the waking world to actually brush against Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra's rolling about in the waking world that had them touch Star had been met with Star reaching out in her unconscious state, reacting to the distress she felt, to take Ellesandra's hand tenderly in her own to squeeze. And the effect this had on the dream world was that Star popped into existence in a puff of blue mist. She blinked, looking at Ellesandra...Then Ellesandra...Then Sia...Then finally the other Ellesandra, then back to the first Ellesandra. The real one. She gave a sympathetic gaze. The defeated self rolled her eyes. "What do you care? Aren't you already a glutton for punishment?" they said, their words cutting in an identical way to how the knight's own might cut when borne of their own stern emotion. "At least this dream is actually just you. You, me, that hero that'll never be you standing over there, Sia, and that annoying girl now, apparently, who you couldn't just have the presence of mind to walk away from. Even that's just all in your head. At least you didn't lose to me, 'cause then I bet Sia would be beating your ass right now." After the tirade from the defeated self, the triumphant self responded. "Don't listen to her. You've kept true to yourself, Ellesandra. True to your duty. You were raised to be a knight, and you are proving that you can be. It's a long, difficult walk back from the depths you have fallen to. But even just watching you minutes ago, you live for a challenge. You always have." Star listened to the others speak, but focused mostly on the true self. She wore sympathy, but seemed to be waiting for the knight to speak their response.

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was something ironic in that Ellesandra's movements when expressing frustration at having people invade her dreams and mind had somehow invited Star into her dream. Ellesandra spun when seeing the blue smoke appear, hand reaching for her weapon, but when she saw it was Star she groaned. The thing is, Ellesandra didn't know it was the real Star. Why would it be? Star hadn't indicated she could invade Ellesandra's dreams, so she just assumed the defeated version of herself had summoned Star as a point somehow. It was a clearing of Sia's throat that brought Ellesandra's attention back to her mentor. Sia didn't speak, but just rose her eyebrows at Ellesandra and gave her a familiar look. It was one she'd given Ellesandra plenty of times in her past, the 'I expect better of you, shape the fuck up' type of look. Ellesandra wasn't acting herself, she was letting her emotions control her responses instead of speaking to these...versions of herself. The look sent another pang of shame strongly through her. Not only for her current response, but the familiarity of that look - and how she'd never see the gentle chiding in person again. Her eyes stayed locked on Sia's face for a moment, and Star would see the struggle with emotions building. The shame weighed so heavily, now that she wasn't dueling and focusing on the joy of that. She couldn't keep looking at Sia, and turned her head to meet the gaze of her defeated self. She took in a deep breath, steadying herself as best she could, eyes closed. She couldn't see Sia right now, but if Star looked she'd see a proud smile on her face as Ellesandra stood up straight and took a familiar-to-her pose. Her right hand, palm facing towards herself, over her chest. The salute to Torm, not one she ever did anymore out of respect to the deity, but because the salute itself brought back comfort and was the pose she'd always been trained to take when she needed to take a moment to breathe and recenter herself. When she opened her eyes, her emotions were 'under control'. That being, they had been pushed down enough they weren't actively effecting her actions. Repressed, theoretically until she could deal with them later when it was appropriate, but in reality to continually be repressed. Training gone wrong, in a way. "Haughty words from someone who surrendered in our last bout. Even at my weakest I would have fought. Tried to learn from a stronger opponent. Giving up, surrendering, in a polite bout is a disgrace to the sport - a sign that you don't care to improve."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The defeated self just grinned and shook her head. "That's fucking rich. You, telling me, that I don't care to improve. Look the fuck around you," said the defeated self, opening her arms to the dead of the dungeon all around them. "This is you. I didn't choose this. You did." She then thrust her arm over to the veil. "You're one quarter the length of this room from giving up. You can't argue with me, you know. I'm YOU. And from the obvious state of this place, a lot bigger a part of you than she is," she said, flinging an arm in annoyance towards the triumphant self, who naturally responded in kind. "Don't listen to her, Ellesandra. Stand tall. Stand proud. You're strong enough to surmount all things. The path ahead will be a struggle, but it will be one that you can achieve. You just faced yourself and held your ground. You did what you were trained to do, and you did so with exemplary poise and form. You're not perfect, but you're not defeated like she is," said the triumphant self, gesturing to the defeated self. "It's just like you say. She's given up. She'll try and drag you down every step of the way, and you're the only one that can stop her from getting her way. Star is right here with you, too. You aren't alone in your fight. Stand behind the words you've JUST spoken. Your heart is on the backfoot, you're in the warning zone. If you step back now, you're surrendering. So make Sia proud, stand tall, and be a fucking woman worthy of the admiration of the people around you. Because that sad excuse for a future is what waits for you if you don't. And the only power she'll grant you is the chance to ensure your legacy will forever be a disgrace." More fervent gesturing to the defeated self, who scowled back at the triumphant self. Star meanwhile moved to stand next to Ellesandra on the flat ground. She smiled up at them. It was in truth not Star herself, not the conscious, waking self. But a manifestation of her, formed within Ellesandra's mind as an avatar of Star's soothing aura. Just looking into her eyes, seeing her hopeful and warm smile would help Ellesandra find calm, find peace in the storm of their emotions, if they needed it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. She didn't need the 'triumphant' version of herself to say all that to encourage her. Nor did she really, fully, believe what her defeated self was saying. She did turn her eyes to look at Star when she moved in front of her, the calming peace helping to push those emotions down. The fear at letting herself open up, like the triumphant version of her wanted to. The shame and feeling like she didn't deserve it - doing exactly what the defeated version said and beating herself down. The calming presence of Star helped separate all of that, keeping Ellesandra in the moment. She looked up at the two and shook her head at them. "No. I may not be who I was before, but I'm also not you." Her gaze was focused on the defeated self's form. "Sia trained me too much to ever lay my sword down at the foot of an opponent. I haven't experienced the joy of learning in a fight for years, but even just the brief exposure in our first fight brought that back. It should have been there for you, too." Her gaze turned up to the triumphant version, and she crossed her arms, looking stern. "But you don't belong here, either. Nothing about us is triumphant. I will do my duty, but my duty is not to be the shining beacon of light and hope you seem to think you are. I'm backseat to the person who will be that, at most. My duty is to protect my charge, that is all." This triumphant, heroic version might have been the vision she had for herself when she was younger, but it no longer was. It wasn't what she wanted to be, either. That was the defeated part's influence - the belief that she didn't deserve to be like that. After she'd failed Marigold, allowed her to go off and get captured for Ellesandra's own sake, and then failed in her rescue and watched her die? She'd forsaken her own duty in the first moment, and proved her ineptitude in the second. No matter what 'glorious' acts she committed from here till her death, that would weigh her down from ever being the triumphant version, the heroic knight.

  "Neither of us is exactly who you are. But we are equal parts of you, distilled into the purest form. Even if you were to slide fully to one side or the other, you would not be us. We are simply avatars, paragons of the truths you will embody. We are here to offer you perspective. You will find power, a gift from one of us, when you come to fully embrace one of us. Either you give up, or you do not. It is a choice only you will be able to make. But the time will come where you will need to make that choice. You will not have the chance to be backseat. You will not be able to decide to surrender to mediocrity, for if you do not give it everything you have, you will become her," said the triumphant self, gesturing again to the defeated self. "She embodies all you will become if you hold yourself back. You saw her decline. She began your fight well. She fought hard. She has all of your strength, but none of your heart. So for as long as you hold onto the believe that this failure you hold onto defines you, you are destined to become her. And all you'll do if you allow that is make Sia wonder why she didn't just send you to the gallows, because then you'll have at least put an end to the pathetic image of you that still lives inside you." The triumphant self folded her arms. She didn't find Ellesandra's deflection to be a worthy answer. The defeated self just wore a look of resignation. "...Don't worry. I'll make sure that when you finally embrace me and understand it's better to just give up that our death has...Some sort of meaning," said the defeated self, looking at Ellesandra, still bruised and lightly bleeding from small cuts on her face, with resigned indifference. Star, meanwhile, frowned, and raised a hand up to take one of Ellesandra's own. She squeezed it lightly, just as she was in the waking world. She gently brushed her thumb across the back of Ellesandra's palm. "...I don't want you to give up, Ellesandra. I need you," said Star. "I will always keep fighting for you, so...I'd very much like it for you to keep fighting by my side."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had done well, pushing the shame down, pushing the memory of the last time she'd seen Sia's face. Kneeling before the King and Queen, having explained where their daughter had gone, and why. Their immediately demanding her head, and Sia stepping in. Though she'd stepped in to prevent Ellesandra's death, her recommendation had instead been the whipping. And the look of pure disappointment in her face, the way she didn't look at Ellesandra after the story, how she refused to look even in her direction. The triumphant version's mention of it slammed into her and the shame skyrocketed back up. Part of her, probably the 'defeated' part since she was looking at her, told her that the triumphant version was right. She should have just died there, killed for treason. Unintentional treason, but treason nonetheless. She'd forsaken her duty, allowed Marigold to put herself in danger for Ellesandra's benefit. It was supposed to be the other way around. That speech may have been meant to encourage her that she wasn't the defeated version of herself, but it was all about pointing out that she was. That wasn't something Ellesandra thought she could move past. Her jaw clenched and her straight, proud posture slumped, eyes turning down to the floor. She ignored the words of Star, the touch - though she didn't pull her hand away. "I'm done here. Leave me to my sleep." She didn't know if she had any power in this weird dreamscape. She didn't in the others, with Black Diamond and Sapphire, and was at their whim whether they let her go or not. Here, she didn't know the magic of Freya's, how it worked. If it was something she could simply dismiss, she would try.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The golden veil in the room began to shift, causing a small rumble in the ground as it slid more to the one side, encroaching on the triumphant side and transforming more of it to the defeated landscape. A handful of inches. It forced the triumphant self to take a step back. "Pathetic. To go from saying it isn't you, admonishing that side of you for giving up, and now doing just the same. Where has the fire gone?" she said with a click of her tongue. The defeated self looked at them for a moment, then shook her head. She walked over to the true Ellesandra and laid a hand on their shoulder. "Don't listen to her. It's all right. We rightly bear our shame. You can sleep now." And with that, the world around Ellesandra went black, except for Star. The two stood on equal ground again. Star looked off into the black void of nothingness around them, then slowly moved to slide her arms around Ellesandra. Her presence brought with it a wave of calm, something to soothe and remove the edge from the shame and guilt in their heart. It didn't stop them from feeling it, but her hold was a comforting shield against the crushing weight as lucidity slipped away from Ellesandra again, and they then were surrendered to the valley of their dreams. Dreams which, as the two continued to hold hands, would still carry Star's calming presence. No matter what Ellesandra dreamed of that night, and they would get a chance to dream this time, Star would be present in the dream, and no matter how hard Ellesandra's mind might try to conjure ways for Star to be hurt or killed or whatever else that might torture Ellesandra, her presence would prove resilient. Unrestrained by the constraints of reality, her power within the dreamscape was endless to fight back against anything that dared try to torture Ellesandra. If it was Ellesandra killing Marigold, Star was there to heal the princess and save them. If it was Sia's abandonment, Star was there to stand before the king and queen and argue with all her heart for Ellesandra. It might not be enough to stop Ellesandra from feeling the pain, but no matter what torturous visions greeted the woman in the night, Star would never cease fighting for the knight in her own way, and nothing would be able to harm the woman herself either, for blades bounced off her shimmering aura and illness was purified and expunged and hurtful words were met with stubborn, righteous fury to stand and fight for Ellesandra, no matter the odds.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was right. The fire had gone out, as soon as those emotions had come back up, past her barriers. It was why she didn't let herself feel them, subconsciously. Oh, it was never a conscious thought of 'don't feel these or you won't be able to come out of your depression'. But it was just a gut feeling, a knowing, that if she truly surrendered and let everything come up, to process like Star did, she wouldn't be able to. She didn't have the emotional resilience that Star did. Most of all, the only way she'd survived Marigold's death, hadn't killed herself in her shame and guilt and grief, was by not feeling it. That type of trauma stayed with you, and for someone who had never been taught how to process that emotion, but only to work it out through training or her work? Well, what was left but to work - and so turned Ellesandra into the stoic, distant and guarded defender of her clients. She didn't respond as either of her true selves spoke to her, eyes remaining down and pointedly away from where Sia was, who had been oddly silent during this entire exchange. There had been facial expressions, which in reality was how Sia communicated a lot of the time. A woman of few words, one that Ellesandra had learned from well. Yet, Ellesandra couldn't bring herself to look at her mentor, and thus wouldn't see them. As the dreamscape disappeared and she was surrounded by blackness, she was surprised that Star was there. Annoyance flickered across her face for a moment. She wanted to be alone, to cry and push her feelings down again, but once again Star was there. The hug, the embrace, was unexpected. The gentle touch brought the emotional vulnerability that Ellesandra tried so hard to avoid, to stay away from. It caused her to have to hold back a sob, jaw clenched. IN the real world, holding Star's hand still, Ellesandra curled up into the fetal like position, knees up to her chest like how Star had seen her in the fields. And then the dreams came. With her mind so focused on it, it was indeed the scene in the throne room that came to her in her dreams. It was never true to what actually happened - but what Ellesandra felt everyone said. Ellesandra, kneeling on one knee with her head low, not looking up at the King or Queen, and Sia standing off to the Queen's side as the Queen's own guard during public events. This wasn't public, though. Her, essentially saying "I killed Marigold, I'm sorry." and the King and Queen claiming she'd killed their daughter, and Sia saying she was a disgrace but ought to live in her disgrace, not die for it. No matter that Star defended her, the dream Ellesandra didn't make any form of progress in saying anything but that she killed Marigold herself, and that she was sorry.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's influence was not a logical one. It was emotional. A pillar of support, a bastion unshakeable. The manifestation was her presence in defense of Ellesandra, but extended beyond it. The ability to completely upend a nightmare and turn it into a positive dream, to shatter reality. So it was that what was real became secondary, and Star punched through a hole in the throne room wall, revealing a portal through which she jumped and returned a few seconds later hand in hand with Marigold, looked defiantly to everyone present, and carefully led Marigold to stand in the middle of the throne room. "Look, see? She's not dead. She never died. Ellesandra did nothing wrong." Marigold then just dusted herself off a little, smiling to Ellesandra. "And now we're all going to have tea together, so enough with all this sadness!" decreed the auramancer, evoking no questions from the others present, as her calming influence fought hard against the tide of nightmarish woe. In the real world, Star rolled to her side, shuffling closer. One hand held their hand, the other unconsciously looped around the knight. She was still asleep, but she shifted to a comforting hold as she felt the growing need for such comforts. It wasn't enough to mend the broken heart of the knight. But it kept the tide of sorrow at bay. It turned the nightmare into a dream where Ellesandra could walk with Marigold again, enjoy time together in a field of flowers, to keep company as Marigold and Star sat at a table with tea and scones, talking about all manner of girly things and giggling mirthfully. Star's presence was minimal, keeping a focus on providing a few moments of reprieve from the nightmare, to let Ellesandra experience happiness with the princess in both good memories that were real, and made up ones that were just...Pleasant. Each time Ellesandra's mind might try to reinforce the pain, Star's influence fought back to let Ellesandra just sleep. To just let them have peace in the night.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Somehow, Marigold being alive, being able to spend time together, made Ellesandra even more emotional. Happy emotional, but emotional nonetheless. Still, she wasn't cognizant, lucid in these dreams, and her dream form would enjoy as much of them as they could. Sleeping, without the conscious ideas and thoughts of keeping a distance, Ellesandra curled up into Star's hold, close enough that she was all but holding onto Star herself. The dreams would change a few times, going from one pleasant one to something bad happening then Star's presence somehow making it positive again. Still, after the third attempt her dreams seemed to settle into the pleasant, apparently with Star, Marigold, and Ellesandra having tea and finger foods during a picnic, out in a field not too far off from the one Star and Ellesandra had been in. There was a castle in the distance, but no one else around. Through the night as the pleasant dreams took over, Ellesandra had eased up in her holding of Star, but had not let go. So when she woke up in the morning, holding onto Star, the slow awareness that came to her of what was happening caused her squint at Star, then immediately tense and straighten, muscles becoming stiff and the discomfort of the holding becoming apparent.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's influence ensured that Ellesandra woke pleasantly. A gentle, guiding energy to keep the sadness at bay, even if doing so required filling their heart with happiness enough to make it swell instead. All of it was never forced, but the power of her emotional soothing rarely met a heart it could not settle, for the unconscious mind was easy to take by the hand and gingerly guide to happier places. So it was, when they woke, the initial sensations would be pleasant. Unfortunately, pesky consciousness ensured Ellesandra was tense upon realizing the tender state the two women shared in the night. Star felt the distress, and it slowly stirred her from her slumber. Her face tensed a little, then slowly did her eyes peek open. Sleepy eyes looked at Ellesandra. Recognition was...Slowly kicking in. There was time enough for Ellesandra to slip away, though if they didn't, Star's sleepy self wasn't in a rush to do so. "Mmmnh..?" Still a bit too sleepy to really understand what was happening.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra may have drifted into a waking state pleasantly, but now that her mind had caught up to the fact she'd been cuddling up to Star, holding her, Ellesandra's stiffness was awkward and, well, tense. She was frozen, not sure what to do. If she jerked away, it would surely wake Star, so she resisted just jerking away. Could she extract herself softly without bothering her? Her eyes trailed down to where her head had been resting, curled up close to Star's chest, and she saw wetness there. Tear stains? The dream last night, well the fake dream part of it where she'd been seeing two different versions of herself, Sia, and Star, came back to her then. The reminder of her shame hit full force and she immediately moved to release star, breaking contact to try to prevent Star from feeling that any more than she'd already be able to do so just by looking at her. Star had apparently already started to wake up, but Ellesandra didn't notice, moving to climb out of the tent and ignoring any jostling, hoping that it would just be Star rolling over in her sleep. Outside of the tent, she grabbed the piece of wood she'd been wittling the night before. It had been cut down into the shape of a typical 'star', with 5 points. She moved it to the side so it wouldn't get caught in any campfire or anything, and set about making a fire for the morning, at least until or if Star interrupted her. Focusing on something to do, on work, would help her focus her mind away from the memories. The pleasant dreams with Marigold and Star, which seemed to hurt even more now that they weren't real, and the reminder of how she couldn't look at Sia, how the defeated version of herself seemed to just get stronger in the dream last night, the triumphant one losing space. Her heart ached, but she tried to push that down with work.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly didn't need to touch Ellesandra to see that rush of shame. The aching heart, all of this, was enough to bring Star to the waking world. She didn't mind the knight slipping away. It was perhaps preferable to them deciding to get upset and defensive about the state they woke up in. Star wasn't far behind them of course, trying to sort through the emotions that she had held onto through the night. Shame...Pain...Happiness...There was a lot to recall, though the purpose of it all, the cause of it all, was lost on her. She also had her own dreams to content with, unknown to Ellesandra. So it was with languid motions that she joined Ellesandra at the campfire, sitting nearby and yawning. She might have thought to say something, but then she noticed the whittled 5 pointed star. She obviously knew what her own name was, so even sleepy brain couldn't stop the instant connection, which just shut her up before she could speak and splattered a bright red blush on her cheeks.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over only briefly when Star exited the tend before going back to setting up the campfire. She set it up to cook some breakfast, though it was mostly roasting some vegetables and eating fruits for breakfast this morning. She didn't say anything despite seeing that Star was blushing and noticed the wooden star. When everything was setup, she moved to grab a log and sit down nearby, taking the star and the wittling knife that had been left out near it, and starting on shaving a bit from one of the points to even it all out. It wasn't quite done, but was decently close to being so. It was while she was focusing on this, eyes on the star, that she finally spoke again. "So, was that my dreams bringing you up on their own, or did you step into my mind while we slept?" It was important to know whether that was actually Star, and if she remembered any of it, or if it was just her own mind bringing Star into the equation. Or perhaps the magic of the card - either way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star didn't say anything as Ellesandra set about doing the morning routine. She had learned in her time with the knight that she couldn't just...Brazenly barge against every negative emotion Ellesandra felt and tackle it head on like she could for others. She had to consider it. Think on it. Let Ellesandra have their time, as well. The question that came evoked some confusion, however. She tilted her head slightly. "Eh? I was in your dreams?" That about answered the question on its own, but she then shook her head to make it clear. "I didn't step into your mind, no. Putting aside that you need to allow me to do that to do things like share memories, I wouldn't do it without you agreeing to it." She wouldn't be able to, but she wanted to specifically emphasize that she also just wouldn't do so even if she could. It did sting in her heart that she had to constantly reinforce to Ellesandra that she wasn't ever going to willfully breach their privacy, but she also knew it was obviously important to the knight, so she just kept that pain to herself to let it pass through her heart in time.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was quiet while working, listening to Star's answer and then letting the silence stretch for another moment or two afterwards. The star in her hand was turned and another imperfection worked on, letting the soothing morning air comfort her. Ellesandra felt awkward, a little embarrassed by how she'd woken up cuddling up against Star, and still feeling both confused and upset by the dreams last night. Finishing the last little bit of imbalance, then she held it out to Star. "I know you said you wouldn't do it intentionally, but since it happened during sleep I wasn't sure it was something else that might have been unintentional." She had kept talking, to distract from Star commenting on how Ellesandra had literally made her a star. It hadn't started out as that intention, just what Ellesandra had started doing and finding it turned into that. A subconscious thing, but Ellesandra was not going to examine why, and she didn't really want to explain to Star she had no real reason for making it for her - just felt it was right. "I had a dream related to that magical card Freya gave me, and you were part of it. Just wanted to know if you were aware of that, or not." It would have revealed things about herself that she didn't want Star to know. If she did, Ellesandra wasn't sure she could stop the prying from the empathic woman.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could, for the better part of an afternoon, talk to Ellesandra entirely about this wooden star, what it meant to her, and what it meant that Ellesandra made it for her in the first place, subconsciously or not, but she wasn't in the mood to argue with Ellesandra. Instead, her eyes got misty, she hugged the wooden carving to her chest with both arms, and she cried a little. No sobbing, just silent tears from an overwhelmed heart. She sniffled. "N-No, m'not...I-I'd really like it if...Erm...It might be important to figure out what it meant, i-if you wanna...Talk about it..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a moment of concern when Star started crying. Had she done something wrong? Ellesandra watched her warily, taking a moment to come to the conclusion that they weren't sad or upset tears. She took in a deep breath and shook her head, unsure how Star let herself feel so strongly. It would kill Ellesandra to feel as strongly as Star did, to cry like that at something as simple as being gifted a wooden star. She turned to the food and began putting it on plates, serving one over to Star and waving her question away. "Symbolic needless exercise of fighting my defeated self and my triumphant self apparently encouraging me to be the hero you see me as." Okay, so it didn't take Star's power to see that Ellesandra wasn't telling the whole truth. Her jaw clenched at the memories of the dream again and she didn't meet Star's gaze, even as handing over the food then moving to sit and eat herself. Her question had been answered; Star didn't remember what had happened in the dream. Her past was safe, and she wasn't going to have to explain anything to her. There was relief there, not needing to open up, being able to keep it all bottled closed.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The star was engulfed in soft white light as she listened to the reply. It vanished moments later into motes of light that dissipated. Off to her magical storage space it went for safe keeping before she accepted her plate. She still had some tears, but it was drying up. She responded with a gentle voice: "I can't tell sometimes if you've forgotten that I can easily tell when someone is lying to me, or telling a half truth, or if you just do that knowing full well this fact and are just implying the rest of it is off limits." She wasn't holding an accusing tone with those words. It was just one part reminder, one part her saying flat out she knew there was more to it. "...Sounds like I would get along pretty well with that triumphant self of yours."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra stopped eating, looking up at Star directly at the callout. "The latter." She said this flatly, knowing that Star would have been able to tell if she tried to imply anything other than the truth here. "It's nothing against you, Star. I just don't share or talk about it, with anyone." This was said softer, trying to reduce any of the blow from her confirming the rest was simply off limits. There was a bit of it that saying that was lying to herself too, to try to pretend it was something as simple as that even if it wasn't, but that wasn't a conscious decision. She looked back down at her plate, eating more and chewing thoughtfully while thinking of the triumphant version of herself. "I'm not sure about that. She was a bit full of herself. High and mighty, and demeaning. If that's who I turn out to be, I'm sorry."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft frown at the flat response. Even them saying it was nothing against her, it did still spoil her appetite a little. She still ate, goodness knowing Ellesandra would yell at her otherwise. But between the night before and this morning, she felt like her heart was buried in a foot of mud. She did at least grin a little at Ellesandra's description. "I've met the sort. But I'm fairly sure that all of the possible permutations that you could reasonably turn out to be are versions of you that I could get along with, so long as it's the same you at the core." Was she going to elaborate more on that? Didn't seem so. Just kept going with the usual topic change that was too abrupt to let the other topic be lingered on. "There's a lot you don't share or talk about. I'm still going to insist that it's the wrong path, the wrong way to handle it. But I also don't have the emotional strength to argue with you, so...Feel free to move along to something practical." There was a lingering sadness in her voice as she spoke those words. She didn't like anything about...Any of this. It was a resigned acceptance to the struggles she faced against Ellesandra's brick wall of a heart.

The frown seemed to hit Ellesandra. Not physically of course, but the more she saw Star get upset at Ellesandra's barriers, the worse Ellesandra felt for them. It wasn't that she regretted having those barriers; she was confident and certain in her desire and need to have them. She did, however, dislike how much it upset Star that she kept those boundaries firm. "I don't think I could get along with any of my own selves." She said honestly, remembering how irritated she'd been at her Defeated self for giving up, and then at how mighty her victorious self had been. So self-centered and important. A snort came at the thought of ever being like that, and she focused on finishing up her plate while considering how to approach this new awkward tension with Star. "Star, I'm not sure how to approach this. I'm not comfortable sharing, not because I don't trust you, but because sharing makes me address it and I can't do that, okay? It's best left repressed and in the past. I'll do what I can to make that not an issue between us, but you being able to see my emotions makes all my normal methods of dealing with it useless in hiding or repressing it, because you still see it. So if there's a middle ground where you're more comfortable with, let me know."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	There were a lot of ways that Ellesandra could have addressed the tension, but them saying what, to Star, just boiled down to 'I trust you but I'm also dying inside and there's nothing anyone can do about it and you just have to accept it' nearly had Star lash out in anger. Indeed, the tension in her was visible, and more than that, her aura pulsed outward, visible for the moment to Ellesandra and it shone with a brilliant, bright crimson. It was rare for Star's emotions to bleed into visibility when she wasn't meditating, but it was a brief glimpse for Ellesandra what it was like to be Star. Still, Star wasn't angry directly at Ellesandra. She knew that. She wasn't about to go and blame the victim for their suffering. She only wished she had an audience with some of the people in Ellesandra's past. But even then, she didn't know who. She drew in a soft breath, then exhaled through her mouth. Her aura slowly subsided from visibility again. "...I hope you realize what you just said sounds like me trying to give you tips on how to fight with your rapier," she said, only once she had let her anger flow through and out of her, so she could carry a light tone to her words. Gentleness and kindness were how she wanted to address those words. "Emotions have been...Central to my entire life, I'm sure that's not so surprising to hear. So you have to understand that when I say things like I know when someone's lying, that includes me knowing when someone is lying to themselves." She moved to hug her knees to her chest as she spoke, not looking at Ellesandra directly, but occasionally flicking her eyes to them, then back to the fire. "I'm still not...Going to argue with you about this. You can-- You SHOULD feel however you want to feel about it. But insisting it's best left repressed and in the past is an affront to everything I've ever known, everything I've ever been taught." She still smiled. A combination of tone and reassurance that said this wasn't her casting blame at Ellesandra. "Nobody can force you to face it. And I'd certainly never want to just throw you or anyone who has such deep trauma into it all at once. That sort of emotional turmoil makes people do rash things." She gently shook her head. "No I...I said it before, and I really just need you to trust me when I say that emotions can be an immense source of strength, or they can be a sapping, sickly, virulent poison. And that doesn't just go away when it poisons you so, it just...Gets worse, as poisons do." She paused a moment, smiling as she looked at the fire. "I want to be clear I'm not pushing you right now. I'm just...Expressing myself. But I'm not just talking from nowhere, you know. Things like this are quite literally what define my gift. And if that wasn't enough, well...I saw it for myself. You, facing the pain inside. Back in the elven settlement. I'm sure that was just the surface of it, just the tiniest part of it. And it hurt, a lot. I saw for myself. And I don't think I told you but, that pain you felt left a wispy trail of memory behind. I didn't peer into the memory, of course," she said, shaking her head again. "I told you I wouldn't, and I wasn't really planning on telling you, because me acting in good faith of your trust is just...How it is. But, I guess it's relevant here. Anyway, I was...Just bringing that up because it's just, well...Proof that you can address it. It's probably the most unpleasant thing you can think of doing, but...You CAN face it. It just takes...A lot of tears, a lot of pain, a lot of it feeling worse before it gets better. For me at least, when I face things that hurt me deeply, it's really helped me that you could hold me through them." She smiled, looking at Ellesandra again. "So again I just...Needed to say all that, not to push you. Just to let you hear me. There might be a lot I'm still naiive about, but...When it comes to emotions, I'm about as expert as they come. Even if your heart is screaming at you to tell me I'm wrong, and you might still do that...I know I'm not."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra physically flinched when Star's aura suddenly erupted around her. The red was obvious, though Ellesandra wasn't entirely certain what emotion that was associated with. Frustration? Anger? She looked away, at her empty plate, and then set it aside and took a deep breath. She listened to Star, not looking at her through the entire explanation, but she strongly disagreed with it. How was she supposed to address the emotions, the past, when it was so overwhelming? Yes it was a poison, but letting it slowly seep out and poison her was less harmful than just drinking the poison entirely. At least, that's how she felt. Sure, she recognized Star was better with emotions, understood them better and how to process, but she just couldn't do what Star suggested. The idea of how much pain there was, the fear and trepidation at facing those memories...she shook her head. "Star, I-." She paused not quite sure what to say. It felt like she should say something, respond to what Star said, but she had no response. She knew Star was right in theory, but in practice? Ellesandra was trained to keep her emotions down, she honestly didn't know how to open up with them. And to just let that much pain open? It was stupid to do. Best not to feel it, and be able to continue with their journey. With Star's mother confirmed captured, they needed to make time - not spend useless hours comforting Ellesandra. She chewed on her inside cheek for a moment before standing and picking up her whittling knife. "We've got work to do. We can revisit this topic when it's done." Well, that wasn't a 'shut up I'll never do that', but it also was a long way away, most likely, before they found Star's mother so it might as well have been. She began taking down camp and putting her armor back on, trying to let the morning routine calm her back down and also trying not to look in Star's direction, knowing she would likely be hurt by the dismissal again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was specifically watching Ellesandra as she concluded her words so she could watch her prediction unfold. The doubt. The fear. The trepidation. She smiled a knowing smile. She expected this result. She was okay with it. So truly, Ellesandra deflecting was among the better responses. Part of her worried her insistence would just cause Ellesandra to up and run away, though she knew that was more fear than logic talking. She stood up when Ellesandra did and intercepted them. She moved behind them and looped her arms around their midsection for a moment, hugging up against their back. Emotional walls were solid. Star was okay. She just...Wanted a hug. "It's okay, Ellesandra." What was okay? She didn't specify. She just released the hold and let Ellesandra get to their work. She cleaned up a little where she could, putting her bedroll back away to magical fairy land, but left the heavy lifting to Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not been expecting the hug. She stiffened immediately, the discomfort with the touching and potential emotional sharing very evident. Her arms were held out awkwardly as she was hugged, as if she didn't know what to do with them having been caught off guard. There was a part, a very small part, of her that wanted to relax into the hold. To enjoy the physical touch of another person for more than just pleasure. It had been years since she'd let herself relax like that, to be held and comforted. Obviously, that didn't happen. She awkwardly stepped away from Star when the hold was released, having never returned it. She watched Star with confusion obvious, not sure where the hug had come from. And what was okay? Just that Ellesandra was herself and drew barriers? That was good, because that wasn't going to change. She watched Star put her bedroll away, then moved off to continue taking down camp. She felt uncomfortable with the conversation they'd just had, how raw her emotions felt between that and her dream last night, and also uncomfortable with the dream of Star and Marigold getting along together, having a little picnic. It was a happy dream, but in the waking world, letting herself think about it, it induced some of that grief. That such a thing could never happen anymore. Her lips pursed, and eventually she finished packing up and turned to face Star, fully armored again and weapon on her hip. "Are you ready?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star naturally didn't need the physical connection to see Ellesandra's awkwardness, and desire to relax in the hold. It made Star smile. It might be small, but it was something. A small something. A small something that could grow into a bigger something, if nurtured. Star had things she was uncomfortable with, but unlike Ellesandra she was able to work through those things in her heart and be okay with things again for now. Genuinely fine, not just...Repressed and bottled up fine. She nodded to Ellesandra, ready to move along with them. The passage to the ruins marked on the map wasn't too long of a trek. Another hour moving through the foliage until the path leveled out and gave way to a clearing and the remnants of what was once, long ago, a road. Patchy grass now covered it, but the smoother ground alluded to what it once was before nature reclaimed it all. In the clearing beyond, there were overgrown, stony ruins that were crumbling from the passage of time. But before Ellesandra and Star could enter, a magical pulse flashed on the ground in the shape of a magical circle inscribed with all manner of glyphs and mystic shapes, and from it rose a spectral dire wolf. The creature was ethereal and blue in hue and slightly transparent, measuring about four feet from paw pad to spine. It stood just before, barring entry, what appeared to be a crumbling archway leading into the ruins proper. But it wasn't attacking. Just standing horizontally facing Star and Ellesandra, defensive. Its eyes were bright blue, solid orbs of mana that had wispy lines running upwards, further reinforcing the creature's magical nature. Before any rash actions could be taken, though it was likely Ellesandra's blade was already drawn, a voice projected from the wolf. The wolf's mouth wasn't moving, however, so it was more likely another source for the voice projected through the creature: "Halt! This area is under security of the First Crusaders," said the decidedly feminine voice that...Did not at all match the image of an imposing dire wolf. "Identify yourself and state your business, or leave now."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She led the way, keeping an eye on their surroundings as they walked. In nature, you less had to worry about someone ambushing you, and usually more about beasts. She kept her eyes peeled for both while leading, but it really wasn't a long trek from their camp to the ruins. In theory they could have easily made it before too late last night, but considering the exhaustion from previous days it was safer to go ahead and rest before heading over, just in case something happened. This was even more reinforced when, upon approaching the stony ruins, a magical pulse flashed on the ground. Ellesandra's hand dropped to her rapier, not drawing it but preparing to if it was needed. The spectral dire wolf appearing caused her to shift back into a defensive stance, but still she had not drawn her blade. The magic was not necessarily hostile, even if it was most likely hostile. When it stood before them, she ensured Star was behind her and not easily approachable by the roof. Additionally, she checked their surroundings to ensure no one else had approached at the creation of this wolf, but otherwise looked back towards the wolf. She didn't answer it, but instead left the speaking to Star, hand still resting on her rapier. It was Star's mission, after all, and she was also the one better at speaking to people - and creatures. Even if this was likely a magical wolf, Ellesandra's way of talking to people and simply demanding entrance probably wouldn't be the best received. So, Ellesandra was silent, only glancing briefly at Star out of the corner of her eye to ensure she was safe and prepared to speak to it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was briefly startled, but she had safety behind Ellesandra. The demands from the wolf, or rather whoever had summoned the wolf, had her step just slightly to the side to ensure the being could see her as she spoke. A sign of non-hostility, though she was able to keep behind Ellesandra in a moment's notice if needed. "My name is Star, and this is Ellesandra. We come seeking travelers from Myst. We aim to travel to Myst, but as I understand one needs to be guided there," said Star. A few moments of silence passed. "Why did you come here looking for such things?" was the response. "Someone observed such travelers in this place. A friend of ours, a scholar," came Star's reply, not mentioning a name or where the man lived just in case. Another pause. "...I bet it was Ayden, bumbling around, probably flirted with them or something," came a mumble, the sort of thing one muttered to themselves not realizing they could be heard. "Fine," resumed the projected voice. "Come in, we can talk. Keep your weapons sheathed." And with that, the dire wolf burst into blue light, vanishing.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't quite sure what to make of the wolf mumbling to itself. It was obviously some form of mouthpiece for whatever magic user was casting it, and there was definite amusement when it mumbled about someone named Ayden bumbling around and flirting with strangers. She glanced back at Star when they were invited in, and though she had never actually drawn her weapon, she kept her hand resting on it. Despite the invitation in, Ellesandra didn't trust like that - and whoever was in there obviously had use of magic, so they could be walking into a trap. It was with that in mind that Ellesandra would take a step closer to Star, almost to where their arms were brushing as she began walking forward. "Feel free to do the talking, unless you're threatened." She mumbled out of the side of her mouth. It was an invitation to be the talker of the group, since that wasn't exactly something Ellesandra was good at or did a lot of. Instead, she did what she was good at. She kept her eyes peeled, figurative hackles up and ready to pounce in front of Star at the smallest sign of hostility from anyone within. One of the gems had indicated that Myst might be dangerous - she didn't remember or really care which one - even if Black Diamond's own group wasn't there.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to Ellesandra, then began walking. Through the crumbling archway, the ruins were all above-ground. A remnant of a settlement, it seemed. One that was sectioned into four quadrants, with main roads leading from the center in all four cardinal directions. Star and Ellesandra walked in through the remains of buildings that were slowly coming to be reclaimed by nature. Just stone remained, the wood having rotted and crumbled years upon years ago no doubt. At the center of this ruined city was a central fountain, though it too was understandably broken down and in shambles. Barely even a fountain at this point, just the majority of a marble circle overgrown with moss and vines and a vague shunt of marble rising from the middle that at one point was the central spout. Standing around this fountain was a woman in a tight dress with a frilly skirt holding a coiled whip in one hand, arms crossed. There were two floating blue orbs floating near her, each with the same eyes of blue mana, though these orbs had little mouths. One looked worried, the other had fang-like jagged lines and a devilish grin about it. Safe to assume it was the person speaking to them. This person observed Star and Ellesandra with caution as they approached. Nobody else seemed to be present in this large remnant of the city. When Star and Ellesandra drew within a respectable distance, the woman held up a palm, signaling them to halt. It gave a wide berth so either side could react if things went south. "Wait there. I've called the captain to come speak to you."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took some time while walking in, taking in how the ruins looked. Ruins were always risky for adventurers, and she'd tended to avoid them in her travels. She had taken one job to guard a merchant going into one with the goal of getting the treasure inside and it hadn't quite ended swimmingly. No one had died, but it had been a close call, so it was with this suspicion and concern that she kept her eyes scanning the environment around them. In one way it was sad, thinking about the history destroyed by nature, no longer kept up by whoever used to live or settle here, the potential death of multiple people to lead to this place being abandoned at some point in the past. A sign of time and how things changed, and never really lasted. Ellesandra wasn't here to sight see though, turning her attention to the woman greeting them. She eyed the weapon, and then the two blue orbs floating around her. Was one of them the wolf they'd just encountered? Or had manifested as such? Ellesandra did as asked originally, not drawing her weapon, but her left hand rested on the pommel in a forced relaxed posture. A silent nod was all that was given to the woman at her request to wait, standing still close to Star. She was happy to wait for whatever captain, as it would make this faster rather than having to explain their story and goal to multiple people. And the faster they got through all of this, the faster they'd be closer to their goal - and less likely they'd get attacked on the way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept quiet while they waited, keeping her hands easy at her sides and in view. She didn't want to make this into a problem, so she kept to herself how CUTE she found the ears sitting on top of this woman's head. The wait wouldn't be long; a portal opened suddenly near the fountain, a swirling mass of blues and blacks inside a ring of tight white lines of light. Through it stepped another woman. Sporting the same ears as the first woman, this captain was...Tall. The girl with the wavy blue hair was about five-two, but the captain stood a towering six-three. She easily towered over the other three women present. She had armored greaves, sabatons, vambraces, and gauntlets, along with pauldrons that sported a single spike on just the left one. A long spear rest diagonally across her back, secured in place by magic. The captain moved one gauntleted hand to her hip as she sized up Ellesandra and Star with her scarlet eyes. "Right then," began the captain. "Let's get introductions out of the way. I'm captain Amara Sunsong of Myst's First Crusaders. This is Amelia," she said, gesturing to the blue-haired woman. Star responded in kind, introducing herself and Ellesandra with first names. No special titles. "What business do you have in Myst?" asked Amara. "I'm hoping to find a way from there to my home realm. I was cast away from there a long time ago and have been trying to get back," said Star. Amara then addressed Ellesandra. "And you? Is this your home realm? What is your business?" Amara spoke with authority and rigidness that was befitting a military captain. Discipline oozed out of her every pore, and given she was addressing Ellesandra directly, Star naturally kept quiet to let them answer for themselves.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra honestly thought the ears were adorable as well, but never in a million years would she comment on that. As the portal opened, Ellesandra stiffened, prepared for the worst but not assuming it would happen. Getting too defensive might put their hosts on alert that something was wrong, after all. And really, nothing was - Ellesandra was just cautious. As the tall woman stepped out of the portal, she took a moment to assess her. Armored, strong posture, obviously in charge. It was easy to respect the authority, even if the woman had no actual authority over Ellesandra herself. Training kicked in and though Ellesandra had been silent, watching the interaction between this Amara and Star, she spoke up quickly when Amara directed a question to her. "Yes ma'am, the one we're currently in is my home realm. My business is directly aligned with Star's, as I have been hired as her bodyguard for the journey. Her mission as such is mine." A united front, one that Ellesandra would always give to strangers when it came to Star. Even if they were upset with eachother or disagreed in regards to how to handle emotions, Ellesandra would always be at Star's side when needed. On her side. She didn't speak more or add any more, only answering the question that had been asked and not adding unnecessary detail. Despite the respect she was offering someone of obvious command authority, her hand had not left her rapier. She respected authority, but it did not mean that the authority could not be wielded against them.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara took note of the posture. She didn't seem put on guard by Ellesandra keeping a hand near their blade, but that was in part thanks to the distance. Enough that she would be able to draw her spear with time to spare. "Understood," said Amara. "Then the next consideration is as follows: Myst is not a place that will tolerate uncivil behaviour. While in Myst, physical altercations of any degree will be met with imprisonment. Drawing a weapon for any reason other than self-defense or defense of another will similarly be considered a crime. It is a safe place with no room for hostility. As such, there is what is known as a dampening field within Myst. It will suppress your ability to use magic of any sort; it does not neutralize your magic nor siphon it in any way, but you will not be able to form your mana into any useable spell while in Myst. If either of you have any magic that is required to sustain you and your natural state or anything of that ilk, you need to inform me now so accommodations may be looked into." Amara then paused, looking at Star, then Ellesandra. Star gently shook her head, not seeing any problem with the terms nor finding the notion of her magic being suppressed to be an issue. "Remind me to get our money out to leave with you before we go," was all she had to say, directed to Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched the woman, nodding to the rules listed. They made sense, and also made her thankful she hadn't been aggressive enough to draw her blade on the magical wolf. She shook her head at the magic comment, none of her magic being absolutely necessary for any reason other than used in a fight. She had used her penetratic strike to cut food before, but the chances of that being needed were extremely low. A nod was given to Star, and she responded in a low voice. She wasn't trying to keep the conversation hidden from the two Myst natives, they could still hear it, but making it obvious the comment wasn't directed at then. "Best not to get all of it, the risk for pickpocketing is higher on our physical forms than in your storage. Don't forget to get anything else we might need out of your storage as well; your bedroll for example. We can strap it to the top of my bag." It was likely they would be sleeping in taverns and inns for the most part, but there was always a chance they'd have to camp out somewhere and she didn't want Star to forget that. Turning to look back to Amara, she nodded her understanding to the rules and expectations, and finally relaxed her posture. Oh she was still watching, wary, but she dropped her hand back down to her side rather than resting on her weapon.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Things were going well it seemed. Amara and Amelia were certainly not threats. Amelia might look a little bored, maybe a tiny bit grumpy, but that looked like it could just be resting bitch face. Amara kept a stern air about her, but she was acting in a language Ellesandra likely understood. She had duty to fulfil, and a no-nonsense approach to get it done. But seeing Ellesandra drop their hand, Amara gave a smile. She understood the silent assurance of...Perhaps not trust, but at least an understanding they weren't hostile to each other. But the calm peace was interrupted by a tingle in Ellesandra's mind. The shadow. It was approaching, and fast. Fast enough that it was nearly on top of Ellesandra by the time it could register on their mind; a portal opened a ways off the fountain, and a tall man stepped through who bore the essence of the shadow. Specifically, it resonated with the essence of the Blood Emerald, which Ellesandra was familiar with from the one dream on the ship. The man in question wore a set of fine clothes, including a fetching hat atop his head of bright green hair, which matched his eyes. He wore a shit-eating grin as he stepped towards the other four. Amelia and Amara jumped to stand on guard, with Amara jumping ahead of Amelia as she drew her spear. Amelia kept behind Amara, immediately channeling her mana to send pulses outwards that saw three humanoid, fey-like spirits with featureless faces and feminine figures summoned in the air, all facing this intruder. Mana glowed in the hands of these three fey summons, which were blue and slightly transparent just as the wolf had been, a mixture of different elemental bolts that were ready to be flung at Amelia's command; Amelia was clearly an arcane summoner of some measure. Star kept close to Ellesandra of course, but no attacks had been slung initially. The man opened his arms to the group. "Well, what a welcome that is!" he said with a boisterous voice and a chuckle. "Ellesandraaaaaa...Where are you?" he said, making a show of putting one hand to his forehead as if blocking the sun and looked left, then right, then left, then looked directly at Ellesandra. "Ah, there you are! You're so short, I'm sorry, I almost didn't see you. You've been...Naughty, you know. It's almost like...You were about to go to Myst, like you weren't even listening to the warnings!"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The feeling of the shadow resulted in an immediate flash of panic in Ellesandra's emotions. The shadow being nearby, and approaching nonetheless, was NOT a good thing. So while it was probably at the same time as the person appeared through the portal, Star would have surely gotten a flash of something being wrong from Ellesandra. Her hand went straight to her weapon again and she turned to face the man, drawing it without giving him the same courtesy as she had the two ladies from Myst. She'd given them the benefit of the doubt while being on guard; the Blood Emerald got no such thing. She knew, for a fact, that he was not on their side, and had the potential to be hostile - and powerful. Her movement was fluid, drawing her blade and stepping in front of Star. She took a defensive posture, right hand making a few symbols in the air and a light blue glow encompassing her form as she reinforced her magical defenses. She would cast haste if a fight actually started, but due to how much it effected her body she wouldn't cast it until it was needed. Her basic defense spell though did not wear her body down like haste did, so no harm in placing it preemptively. If the short comment had come from anyone other than the man, she might have been amused by the antics. Ellesandra was short, especially for a guard and someone who spent a lot of their time training and learning to fight. You could put her in a servants outfit and she'd be able to fit in well enough simply because not many would see a 5'1 woman and thing 'oh she can fight', no matter how awkward she might be at whatever servants task she'd been given. In the training grounds, she fought to earn respect and eventually the jokes had turned from her being small and weak, to instead of ever poking fun at her directly they poked fun at her opponents for losing to a small girl. Which usually resulted in the joker getting punched in the arm with her middle finger out to give them a dead arm. That wasn't really an option here, nor was that the vibe that the two had. She met the man's eyes, having already cooled her panic into a caution and protective nature over Star. "I listened to the warnings. We're going to finish our mission, no matter your threats though."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Amelia and Amara looked at Ellesandra at the exchange went on. Star of course noticed the panic, and she dutifully fell in line near her protector, while also being prepared to do what she could in the fight. It looked like a fight was going to happen, at least. Though, this tall man just chuckled at the response. "Ahhh, so you're not deaf, you're just STUPID! I see, I see," he said, not really paying mind to the two crusaders. "Well. If THAT'S how it is, then might as well make sure you just die here, right? Shame you had to drag two other innocent people into it, but hey, what am I saying?" he said with an uproarious laugh, then fixed a piercing gaze upon Ellesandra as a smirk drew across his lips. "...You're all about letting innocent people around you die, isn't that right?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
To Amara, the Blood Emerald, and Amelia Ellesandra didn't react to that at all. Her face was stoic and she looked ready to fight, no flinching or movement or anything in response to it. To Star? The words met their target, but probably didn't get the reaction that he had wanted them to. He brought back that shame, that guilt that had been so heavy when she'd mentioned that someone had died for her previously. But that was well enough bottled up, pushed down enough, that it was quickly overtaken by a different emotion - fury. Fury, that he would use that against her. That he would try to throw Marigold's death in her face, to knock her off balance for a fight. To imply that Amelia and Amara would die just as she did in this, innocent and for her. The thing was, when a form of herself put her down by commenting on her shame, that was one thing. When someone she knew, trusted, looked up to, put her down for it - she took that and it truly effected her. When an opponent used it as a weapon? It might hit those feelings, that trauma and guilt inside her, but her fury at someone dropping that low to get to her far surpassed the guilt she felt in response to the comment. "Star, back up please." Her words came out even, controlled. Despite the fury, she was trained enough to not let it overtake her in a fight. It only had once, and she bore the scars for that - this gem wasn't good enough at goading her to make that happen again. Her eyes never left the gem's, ready to meet him in battle without a flinch in her demeanor.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked, seeing the reaction and then hearing the words. She didn't need to be told twice and backed up as requested. Amelia and Amara were still sizing up this opponent. He wasn't even armed. No weapons to speak of. The shadowy essence he possessed was potent. Far, far stronger than the pirate captain had. "Oh, shit. She told the prissy girl to back up. She means business now," said the man, raising his hands up in mock surrender. He didn't seem to be aggressive, which was keeping the other fighters in an uneasy stalemate, eyes occasionally darting around at their surroundings for any other threats. Was he just a distraction? "Wellllllll I could take care of your myself, short stack, but that'd just be...Boring. So what'cha think, Ellestupid? I've got three enemies I could send at you. Why don't you pick a number between one and three, hm? Make it fun. I'll even give you a hint! Number one is dark, number two is ugly, and number three is metal. Unless of course you wanna just take your shot at me now. I mean, you're gonna die anyway, horribly, and hopefully really slowly so like you can have all those regrets while you got blood leaking out of everywhere and it's really sad and shit, so you can always just try and...Stop me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't told Star to back up because she meant business, she just wanted to ensure Star was far enough away that the creature couldn't aim a strike at Ellesandra, Ellesandra dodge, and hit Star instead. No, she wanted Star to be out of the immediate fighting zone; it was also where Star would theoretically be the most useful, able to use whatever magics she had from a safe distance. The name, Ellestupid, was elementary. Again, if it had been anyone other than an enemy using it, she would have probably enjoyed the joke of an insult. There was one moment where Ellesandra took her eyes off the creature, looking around to ensure that none of those three enemies were around to attack Star immediately. The idea of attacking him went through her mind, but she remembered the words from Amara about not attacking someone needlessly. They didn't know the background to this, and if she just outright attacked someone who had done nothing but hurl insults at her that wouldn't be a good indication of their being able to play by those rules. So, Ellesandra stood there, weapon drawn and in a defensive posture, and made the decision not to play the man's game. She would stay silent, just watching him, letting him goad as he wished, attack, or send something else after them. She wanted to just fight him, but she didn't trust that wouldn't result in him sending those three creatures at Amara, Amelia, and Star instead. So, she remained defensive, ready to fight if necessary, and staring him down.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The silence lingered in the air for a time. He waited. Then, deciding Ellesandra wasn't playing his game, he shrugged. "Fine, fine, have it your way, they don't call you dumb for nothing I guess. I'll pick for you, since it was probably a really big assumption on my part that you could count in the first place. I know three is a really, really big number, but try not to hurt yourself thinking about it, all right? And say hello to you-know-who when you get to hell. 'Cause don't worry. I'm sure she's PISSED. Like, way beyond just slapping you and storming off kinda pissed. Like. Gonna tear you a new one so bad I am gonna be sad I won't be there to take notes kinda pissed." He then smirked. "Anyway, yeah. Die horribly. Ciao." He then saluted, spun on his heel, and walked away through a portal that opened for him to close behind him. He, and the shadowy presence, then vanished. Following that, a black lightning bolt struck in the place where he had been standing, and in the wake of the bolt was a suit of wrought-iron armor. The armor brandished a tall kite shield and a longsword, both made of wrought iron as well. All of the armor was charged with magic, and the gaps in the armor showcased a surging red mana. This armor did not contain any person. It was living armor. And it, unlike the man who departed, was armed, and began charging at the group of four. The immediate response came from Amelia, who threw her arm forward, cracking her whip in the air. The three fey creatures that floated in the air above them all responded by throwing bolts of various magic at the armor. A lightning bolt, fire bolt, frost bolt, wind bolt, and earthen bolt, each one a shot of magical energy that would strike down or even kill outright a regular human, each one hit true on the armor, but had no visible effect upon it. Amara looked at Ellesandra through her periphery. They had the opportunity to work together, and a duty to keep the lone enemy away from the backlines that had Amelia and Star. Whether Ellesandra took to their own lead, or deferred to Amara, they had precious few seconds to decide on a plan of action.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wanted to growl at the man. The comment about you know who wanting to slap her was mostly ignored; that wasn't Marigold's style. Oh she might be angry at Ellesandra for many reasons, but Ellesandra would never believe that Marigold blamed her for the result of what happened. Ellesandra blamed herself, and that's what Marigold would be upset at. It didn't make her blame herself any less, but oh well. Still, the fact that he just left? The coward wouldn't even face them himself. Yet, Ellesandra was immediately watching a large form of metal armor that began moving towards them, and didn't have time to curse the man who went back through the portal. She saw the magic lash out from Amelia, but she didn't look towards her. She considered using haste, but held off; if the man came back, or sent other creatures after them right after this one, using it so early in a fight that she wasn't sure would be over after this bout would be reckless. So, as she began moving, she began circling to the outside. Her eyes glanced towards Amara and met them, a light nod given, but she didn't spend much time making eye contact or anything. She wanted Amara to know Ellesandra was comfortable working as a team, but unless Amara gave her any orders to do otherwise, Ellesandra began circling around so that the armor would have to turn to face her, thus turning away from the others. That, or it continued to face the others and gave her a wide opening, but that was the less ideal of the two since it gave it the potential of stepping towards their spellcasters. Really, she wanted it's attention on her. Unfortunately, it seemed like a magical being, so taunting wouldn't work. She'd just have to be close enough to have it consider her a threat as she circled around, posture still defensive for now.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara saw the nod and watched Ellesandra, picking up on the plan immediately. She sped off to take the opposing flank to the armor, forcing it to have to fight on three sides. More bolts of magic hit the armor, but continued to hit with no visible effect. Amelia cursed under her breath, then held an arm up, recalling the essence of the three fey spirits back to her. She glowed faintly blue for a moment as the essence poured back into her, then she began to chant, eyes closed, as mana began to build around her. Amelia clearly had some plan, something that drew Amara's attention briefly. She called out to Ellesandra, believing the armor had no real way of caring about strategy, or at least that the strategy didn't require subtlety. "Just buy Amelia time! Don't take unnecessary risks!" ordered Amara, watching and waiting for how the fight would begin with the armor. The armor started by focusing on Ellesandra, taking swift steps towards the woman to attempt a horizontal slash across their chest. Unfortunately, the armor appeared to be languid in the moment and didn't even particularly come close to hitting her. What followed was then Amara coming from behind to seize on the opportunity. Her spear flourished expertly in one hand, caught with the other as she leapt into the air while loosing a valiant battlecry, the tip of her spear aglow with brilliant golden light as she SLAMMED it down onto the armor, which released a BOOM of magical force outwards. It wouldn't affect Ellesandra at all of course, it was just slightly loud. The effect, however, was the armor was knocked flat onto its front, with a noticeable chink in the back of the breastplate. Amara certainly hit hard, that was obvious, and one could be glad to count themselves as her ally and not her enemy. The armor performed a side swipe of its blade at Amara, but Amara had already hopped back, anticipating the counterattack. She was keeping to her own advice and not getting greedy just because she knocked the armor down. But of course, as it was rising up and thrust its sword behind itself, this opened a perfect opportunity for Ellesandra to get a quick strike in for free, perhaps more depending on how aggressive she elected to be.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was prepared for the swipe, but had expected it to actually come close. She was defensive after, waiting for a follow up and assuming that was a feint but...it just wasn't. It had fully missed her. More magic struck out while Amara slammed into it with her spear, Ellesandra glancing between them then also glancing towards Star to ensure she was still safe, since she hadn't seen anything from her yet. Assuming all was safe and well there, Ellesandra would take advantage of it swiping back at Amara, rushing in quickly and sending a wave of magic down the metal of her rapier with a few motions of her right hand. The penetrating strike, designed so that her rapier could pierce straight through a stone wall, was aimed right at one of the armor's joints in it's weapon arm. Oh, it was likely not human and going to react the same way, but she was going for at least damaging one of the weaker parts of the armor to make it's attacks slower. Whether or not that hit or did any major damage, she didn't press her advantage too much. She solidified herself as a potential threat, and quickly pushed back, creating enough distance she'd have room to dodge or move in the case of another attack coming her way, but still close enough she could strike if the creature decided to ignore her or look elsewhere.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star and Amelia were at a safe distance, that much seemed certain. Amelia kept chanting. Whatever they were doing, it seemed it was going to be powerful. But in the thick of the action, Ellesandra was given a free strike on the armor which allowed an easy shot on the weapon arm, which struck the red energy under the armor and cause it to warble and fizzle in response. The first actual sign of damage. A promising sign that was then met with the armor surging to a standing posture, fixed its gaze on Ellesandra, and this time kicked off from the dirt in a display of speed that was far above and beyond what it had previously showcased. But rather than its weapon, the armor, in one leap, flew towards Ellesandra with its shield held out before it that it used to slam into Ellesandra with a heavy shield bash. Ellesandra would find the attack unable to be dodged in time, though they had time enough to react with magic, or at least decide where the bash would hit them. And the force of the strike, if unmitigated, would carry force enough to crack the bone that bore the strike, easily sending Ellesandra off their feet regardless.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected the speed. She didn't wield a shield anymore, which previously is what she would use to deflect some of the blow. That not being an option, she adjusted her position so that the right side of her body was facing the shield. She kept her elbow down to block her ribs, used her forearm to come up to cover her head which she ducked into, and leaned into the blow to ensure the majority of the strike hit her arm - not her legs or waist or anything. In addition, the blue that had been covering her whole form all moved to focus on her singular right arm. Already injured, Ellesandra wasn't too concerned if it got more damaged; it would hurt, and it would suck, but it wouldn't exactly prevent her from fighting further. Still, the magic was used to prevent the force of the blow just obliterating her arm entirely. It was a good thing that the armor didn't follow up with another attack immediately, because Ellesandra MIGHT have underestimated just how much force would hit her. It did knock her off her feet with a crunch as it burst through the magical shield - which was designed to effect magical attacks more than physical attacks anyways, and certainly couldn't hold up against something like this - and hit her arm. She went flying backwards, pain rocketing her right arm as both her right humerus and ulna broke on impact. Her flight backwards was not one which she landed gracefully either, distracted by the pain and the slight ringing in her head at the force of the hit, she didn't get her feet under her in time to land upright. No, she hit the ground, surely bruising her left hip, and even did a single roll from the force of the blow before skidding in the dirt of the road and coming to a stop. "Fuck." Not exactly elegant, the words came out through clenched teeth as she used her left arm to stand. She'd had the presence of mind to hold her rapier out while falling to ensure she hadn't accidentally impaled herself on it, but as she stood she held her right arm close to her body, wincing. Even through the arm, she felt the bruises down the back right shoulder, and all of the old scars from before were screaming anew. She didn't try a counter attack at all, but instead turned her left side back towards the creature, holding up her rapier and preparing herself for a potential follow up attack, and hoping that Amelia was about finished with whatever she was doing.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The strike certainly showcased a heretofore depth to the danger that this animated suit of armor posed. The hit had Star surging with worry. She took a single step forward, then stopped herself. Her instinct, the one that tugged at her heart, to intervene was one that her more battle-acclimated mind, the one she knew Ellesandra would prefer she use, knew was a bad idea. She simply whimpered Ellesandra's name under her breath, holding back tears as she watched the knight get thrown to the ground. It was a fight. Ellesandra could handle it. She had to remind herself of this, and to think tactically. So rather than rush into the fight, she thought how she might be more useful instead. The armor was charging once finding its footing again, ready to follow up as Ellesandra was getting up. However, Star welled her mana and thrust an arm forward towards the fray. The ground between Ellesandra and the charging armor was her target, and her magic formed a green ball of energy in that space which then burst, coating the ground the knight was charging on with grease. A controlled patch, only a few feet across, that would land right underfoot for the knight, rather than coat half the street with it and make the fight messy for her allies as much as their enemy. The timing was tight, but the focus she maintained was peerless; she could not afford to fail Ellesandra in the moment. So it was that the grease appeared just as the armor's foot fell to the ground, then promptly skid out from under it to cause the armor to topple forward and fall prone, sliding a foot or two on the dirt once landing. As this was happening, Amara cursed under her breath, seeing the armor could be so unpredictable, and enveloped herself in mana to thrust across the battlefield with the magic of Misty Step, which saw her interceding between the armor and Ellesandra in defense just as the armor was landing on its face. As the armor was rising up again, Amara reared her spear back, the tip crackling with thunderous energy, then thrust it forward, seizing the chance as the armor was standing to hit it with a thunderous smite that sent it back again about ten feet and onto its back. Rather than push the offensive however, Amara called back, keeping her eyes forward. "Are you able to still fight, soldier?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was a good thing Star had tripped the armored creature, as Ellesandra was almost certain she wouldn't have been able to dodge another blow that quickly. Having just stood, winded and with pain shooting through her right arm, she wouldn't have been able to cast haste quickly enough to use it's speed to get out of the way. She considered casting it now, as she watched Amara magically appear between her and the magical armor and attack it, but dismissed it. She needed to treat this fight as if it was the first of multiple, still not trusting the gem to only send one creature after them. The adrenaline of the fight and what needed to happen helped dull the pain, enough for her to raise her rapier again at the call. "Yes Ma'am." It had been years since she'd been called soldier and it felt...nice. She walked up to stand near Amara, rapier held forward with her left hand and her body tilted so that her injured, right arm was to the back. It was also held close to her body protectively, a combination of protecting the bruised ribs and also knowing any movement beyond keeping it close would cause pain to shoot through it. Old injuries were sore, though in reality that was more a psychological pain than physical. She only glanced towards Amara briefly before back to the creature that had been on it's back, poise loose so that she could easily start moving if it got up and started rushing again. She'd follow Amara's lead here, knowing that in her injured arm's form she would be a potential liability for Amara if she took the lead without going all out. And she still felt the need to hold back from doing that.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara nodded tightly. "Good. Then stay close, but to my flank and behind. We don't need to strike a killing blow, we just need to buy time. When I engage, move to stand between it and Amelia. She needs a bit more time, but she will ensure our victory with what I know she is summoning." Amara gave a quick look at Ellesandra to confirm understanding, then set off in a sprint that kept her spear in one hand, the shaft tight up against the back of her arm and shoulder while the tip was down, inches from the dirt, and vaguely in front of Ellesandra. A stance that allowed her to shield Ellesandra should the armor try to pick on the injured woman. The armor meanwhile had moved to stand again, then 'looked' at Amara and Ellesandra, then at Amelia and Star. It then raised its sword and began towards Amelia and Star. But with grit teeth, Amara shifted her posture to plant her feet firm and rear her posture back, spear in hand, to then hurl it at the armor. "You will face ME, demon!" she cried as she hurled her weapon, which struck true and landed square in the armor's leg, stopping its stride and pinning it in place. This was Ellesandra's opportunity to move to defend, if they chose to stick to the plan.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded her acknowledgment. She didn't like just putting her trust in whatever Amelia was summoning, but she wasn't in a state to argue either way. As Amara began moving forward to strike, Ellesandra kept pace with her. She ignored how each step sent a jarring pain up her right arm, the jostling of it not particularly pleasant, and let the thrill and adrenaline of a fight take over again. It wasn't exactly the type of fight, like the duel with herself in her dream, that one could truly relish since the essence of danger was there, but there was still that bit of joy Star might be able to sense, small beneath the focus, pain, caution and still fuming anger. As Amara hit the armored being, Ellesandra took the opportunity given to move and stand between it and the two spellcasters again. With it's attention briefly moved over to Amara again, Ellesandra tossed her Rapier in the air and quickly made the necessary magical runic signs with her left hand this time, the blue defensive light coming back into place around her again and catching the rapier as it fell back into place. It wasn't as clean as it really should have been, but she hadn't practiced doing that in a long time. Previously she could toss her weapon up, cast, and catch it smoothly and gracefully; it was how she'd practiced it while she still wielded a shield. It hadn't been necessary since she'd started using her right hand for it, not being able to wield a shield on it easily anymore, so as it fell the rapier tipped forward and she had to correct her stance. Ellesandra didn't attack, taking up her guard posture and stepping close enough to create the sense of threat if the creature turned back towards the mages, but instead taking up a defensive posture planned for avoiding a blow and counterattacking if she became the target, or being able to strike a quick blow if it decided to try to step past her towards the mages.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The armor had been stuck for just a moment as the spear impaled through its red 'body' in a gap between the armor. A few tugs had it breaking free, however, and it resumed its advance as Amara caught up to pull her spear free from the dirt. Of course, Ellesandra was in the way now, so the armor began to advance to engage her, only to be once more struck with an empowered strike from Amara from behind, causing the armor to stumble slightly. "I said you face ME!" barked Amara, though whether this was actually to goad the armor or just hype herself up wasn't clear. Amara blossomed with a fearlessness to her that truly befit her rank. The conviction in her eyes was unwavering. Her spirit, unbreakable. Being repeatedly beat up from the enemy the armor was NOT facing seemed to evoke some measure of annoyance as its red 'body' under the armor flashed. It then turned and engaged Amara, just as the captain wanted. Blows traded back and forth. "Ellesandra! Are you okay?" asked Star, keeping her distance but feeling it was a moment she could call out without unduly distracting the knight. Amara and the armor meanwhile had blade meet spear repeatedly, the clang of metal on metal reverberating out with each strike as Amara's footwork kept her at the ideal distance to fight with her spear while keeping her out of range of the armor's longsword so that when thrusts and swipes did break past her ability to deflect with her spear, she had enough room to just slightly shift back in her stance and avoid the strike. She showcased a refinement to her technique as she intercepted strikes, parried, and capitalized on the few openings she was afforded with lightning reflex. But even with a clear earned experience with her craft, the armor surged with magic once more and attempted to do to Amara what it had done to Ellesandra. A sudden flash of red, a burst of speed, and it shot forward at the captain with its shield beared. Amara, having seen the attack on Ellesandra, braced for the hit with a sudden burst of golden light surrounding her, and a loud gong of magical sound as three golden magical shields shot out around her for a split second. Knowledge of divine magic would reveal this to be Shield of Faith, which while it would not save her from the impact, would lessen the blow. Still, just as Ellesandra was hit, so was Amara. But between her magic and knowing what to expect, she was able to throw her shoulder into a body-check at the enemy just before they closed the distance, striking back while also preventing the armor from adding the force of the shield swing to the hit. Despite being prepared, Amara was still sent flying back just the same with a wince of pain clear on her face as she flew back into the wall of the ruins behind her. Her back slammed against the stone wall, cracking it and certainly doing its damage to Amara in the process. A breathless cry came from her as she readied to continue the fight, but the armor was already upon her, floating off the ground this time in anticipation of another attempt to intercept its charge. With Amara pinned and dazed against the wall, it thrust its sword forward, striking straight through Amara's abdomen. Straight through her and, indeed the wall behind, Amara could only cry out in pain as she was struck. Not defeated yet however, Amara's eyes burned with divine fire and she thrust the handle of her spear, held between both hands diagonally across her, at the armor with a thunderous boom of divine energy. The armor was sent stumbling back, its sword still lodged in Amara's abdomen and pinning her to the wall. She looked poised to keep fighting despite her wound, fighting through a truly grievous wound, still impaled. She wasn't calling for help. And though she had no real authority over Ellesandra, the lack of new orders suggested she wanted Ellesandra to stick to the plan. But was that just blind heroism, or was Amara truly just made so tough that she could keep fighting such a lethal opponent in such a state?
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched as the armor turned to fight against Amara. Amara was clearly skilled, but there was an unease as she continued watching. Even if Amara was good, Ellesandra hated just standing to the side, guarding and waiting. She knew she was injured, so it was the right thing to do; strategically, it made sense, which is why she didn't rush in to join Amara's fight and back her up. She hardly heard Star shout, a muttered - "Fine" coming out dismissively. It was obvious she wasn't fine, Star would easily be able to see the pain radiating in her aura, but the fine wasn't even intended to be a lie. Was she tip top shape? No, but that would be obvious to a child. She was fine to keep fighting, and in that Ellesandra was telling the full truth. She focused on the armor while Amara fought, trying to see if she could find a weak spot like the pirate had. There wasn't one, but it was obvious that the magic was the red...stuff inside that was controlling the armor, not the armor itself. That wasn't a surprise, but the fact that she could feel the shadow in it made her consider. That thought was immediately interrupted by the sight of Amara getting slammed into the wall, and then followed up by getting impaled. Ellesandra's response was immediate. "Star, put the grease behind me, between you two and the armor." It would effectively cut the battlefield in half. While it wouldn't be impossible for the armor to get past it, it would at least slow it down and ensure that Ellesandra would be able to catch back up with it if it suddenly changed it's target. Star, if she were paying enough attention, would see a flash of that guilt that she'd seen before, when Ellesandra had broken down in the Elven settlement, but it was quickly masked as Ellesandra focused herself on the battle. Amara may not be calling for her, but she was obviously not in a situation to fight against it, pinned to the wall and impaled as she was. She started with switching her rapier to her right hand as she moved forward. It was painful gripping onto it, but her focus was entirely on her plan of action next. She was trying to use the armor's focus on Amara against it and close the distance quickly enough that it couldn't react. Her left hand made the signs for her haste spell, hoping to only have to use it for a few moments, but at this point it was better than waiting for something that didn't seem to be coming from Amelia while Amara bled out. Ellesandra didn't know Amelia, and she was willing to trust Amara but the situation had changed, so Ellesandra was no longer going for the 'wait for Amelia to finish her spell' plan. As she closed in, her speed having picked up as the golden shimmering light took over her body, she pulled out her dagger with her left hand and aimed at the spot in the armor that Amara had already pierced with her spear. She aimed to strike hard through the armor into the red mana within, but she also didn't plan on pulling her hand back if she succeeded. If she did, she planned on using her power to begin absorbing the red mana, at least as much as she could before she would inevitably be thrown off or away from it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star obviously wasn't expecting Ellesandra to actually be fine fine. Fighting shape fine was good enough for now. A little reassurance that Ellesandra was still in the fight. She gave a tentative nod to that. It was more of an emotional response than a logical one. But more reassuring than hearing Ellesandra say fine was that they were involving her in a plan. She nodded. "Right!" It felt good. She was being involved. Had a purpose. Was able to do more than just stand by helpless as others fought for her. When Ellesandra took off, she did as asked and created a streak of grease that would keep the armor from walking over it without risk of slipping and falling. It had shown it could float, but hopefully that was a limited ability. Regardless, Star watched closely, looking for any other opportunity to help. Ellesandra found the opportunity was present for them. The armor had no weapon as that was still impaling Amara, so even if it had managed to turn and face Ellesandra, it wouldn't have much to do besides try and interpose its shield. It was fixed on Amara, however, so Ellesandra's blade struck true, causing more disturbance in the red essence. Their ability to then absorb the mana, however, proved to destabilize it more significantly and was looking as it would be an effective method of dealing with them. That was until the mana proved to be more than just raw mana, however. It was...Tainted. Almost immediately, Ellesandra felt it. The weight crashing onto their mind. The darkness crawling into it. Their mind's resilience was able to keep it at bay initially, but the waves of pounding darkness were, after a valiant attempt to resist, too strong and eventually broke Ellesandra's resistance. The darkness enveloped Ellesandra's mind, making the world around them fade. Ellesandra was suddenly in the body of another woman who was being struck by an abusive lover through tear stained eyes as the burly man shouted at her for some failure that was inaudible, muffled behind the sound of her own tears. For the moment, Ellesandra WAS this woman, experiencing life through their eyes and feeling the burning of bruises on her face as tears rolled down her cheeks. A minute later, she was in the body of a man who was crawling on the ground, the pounding pain of an arrow in his spine surging through Ellesandra as if it were her own; she would not be able to feel her legs in this existence, and could only crawl with bloody palms along before the sting of a blade entered into her throat and she experienced death itself embrace her. And from there, another woman's life as she watched her own child being dragged away by a gang of slavers who held her at the point of a blade, one of the other masked slavers grinning wide as he undid his belt buckle and eyed the woman menacingly. Then into another body of a man whose every breath wheezed as he lay in bed, feverish to the point of hallucinating and knocking on death's door from the pestilence that was overtaking him. Then into another, a man weeping as an executioner fitted a noose around his neck while he stood upon a platform before an audience of people who threw whatever they had at him. A crime he did not commit, he knew this well, yet he would hang for it; his own wife and son stood among the crowd, looking at him with disgust. His mind screamed he was framed again and again and again, but it was a plea that had been heard by none. He did not want to die, and yet he knew this hour was his last. These visions pounded against Ellesandra's mind again and again and again as the mana burned in Ellesandra's veins. Its influence waned as the mana was consumed, dissipating out of Ellesandra slowly, but steadily. When Ellesandra woke again, she found herself prone on the ground, dagger a handful of feet from her body, and a pounding, painful ringing in her head, along with blood trickling down from her forehead. Nothing was broken there, but the firm back of an elbow had met her forehead to knock her down. The influence wasn't completely gone, but it was steadily still leaving Ellesandra as conscious returned to them. Until it fully left her though, flashes of fear, of these terrified emotions of other people who Ellesandra would know intrinsically were real people. No amount of mental conditioning or pushing the emotions down would suffice. The feeling was overwhelming, having shattered Ellesandra's resistance. It felt like minutes had passed, but in truth, only a dozen seconds or so had passed that encompassed Ellesandra's brief blackout. The armor again moved towards Amara after having knocked Ellesandra away.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had expected the absorption to be odd, since it was controlling a piece of armor, but she had not expected the darkness of it, or how it would effect her mind. She'd gasped as it crashed into her mind, the darkness crawling in. She did her best to resist, but it had hit her in surprise and the effort was futile. The world faded and she felt the pain, the fear, the betrayal of someone being abused. The absolute fear that came with that, the bruised and pained face, the sobbing, choking tears. The yelling was background - she couldn't tell what was being said, exactly, but was overwhelmed with the feeling that the yelling gave her. The anxiety, the complete lack of self-worth that the yelling instilled in her, that she'd done something wrong. That she'd messed up, despite it being the abusive man who was at fault; in the moment, like any DA victim, Ellesandra couldn't tell that. She was then shifted into the body of a man, pain shooting through her back. There was confusion as to what was happening in the back of her mind, but it was too far distant to the actual experience happening to recognize. Each new memory added to the last, until finally she gasped back into the 'real' world, laying on the ground. Her feelings were in complete disarray, having been completely unable to process like she normally would have during those visions, if that's even what you could call them. The fear, pain, sorrow, dread - all of them blurred her vision for a moment and between that and the apparent fact that she was laying on the ground now took her a moment to recenter herself and realize what happened. When she did, staring at the armor making it's way to Amara again, she groaned and moved to stand up. During the experience of the visions her concentration on the haste spell had ended, unable to maintain concentration on a spell when her mind was such focused on different experiences. Luckily, it had only been briefly used, so the lethargy her muscles felt were relatively minimal; more as if she had just been fighting hard for an additional five minutes or so, versus how absolutely exhausted she'd been after fighting the pirate. Pain shot through her right arm as she moved to stand and she focused on that, using it to keep her mind focused on the current situation. She needed to get to the creature before it got to Amara again. She didn't know what to expect from this, but fighting it now when it didn't have it's weapon - and before it got back to put a finishing blow on Amara. Hoping it would either not see her, or turn around and face her entirely rather than focusing on Amara, she stepped forward to strike through it's wounded armor again, except this time she just reached in with her left hand instead of a weapon. Her hand closed inside, attempting to just grip the visible red energy if she could. She didn't know if she could, but either way she did the same thing as last time. She worked to absorb the energy, but ripped her arm back out at the same time, planning to rip the energy out rather than fully absorbing all of it. Even if she did absorb some, she would work to fight off these visions, and keep doing it. Surely, this had to be harming or slowing it down, right?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara wasn't going to just let the armor come kill her, naturally. As Ellesandra was working up to their feet again, Amara reached down to the blade in her abdomen, grabbed it by the hilt, and cried out in pain as she tore the blade out of her, spraying her own blood on the battlefield before her. She threw the sword far and away from the armor, keeping it well out of reach from it. She then swelled her mana inside herself and slammed her other hand against her wound as it began to shine with bright white light. She groaned, but the magic of her Lay on Hands burned into her body and closed the wound, repairing what was broken in her body, leaving not even a scar in its wake. It might have taken all the magic she had left, but she wasn't out of the fight yet. She picked up the spear and moved to meet the armor just as Ellesandra was reaching in to grab more of the mana. Grabbing and throwing it wasn't really proving possible, though Ellesandra did succeed in absorbing more of the mana. And in doing so, another wave of visions much like the first struck Ellesandra, leaving them briefly paralyzed in place. This time, Amara was engaging the armor, however, so Ellesandra was just stuck in a daze as they moved through another half dozen people who suffered, who died, who cried, who were broken by fear and the worst moments of humanity played out before her eyes and forced her to live through them. The briefer contact left these memories too brief and too disordered to remember details; the fear, the suffering, was all that Ellesandra would remember. When Ellesandra woke again, Amara was keeping the armor threatened. But before she could engage in earnest, it seemed Amelia was finally done. She called out: "I CALL OUT TO YOU; HEED MY SUMMON AND OBLITERATE MY ENEMY! I CALL TO THEE, ADAMANTINE DRAGON: VAERIX!" she called out, her voice resonating with booming mana. She then rose her arms straight up. A swell of mana burst out from behind her, the very ground below all of them shaking as a blue, ethereal, semi-transparent summon of a massive dragon; as it rose up from the ground, the blue tint was slowly lost until the dragon took its natural colours and full opaque colouring, revealing it to be coating it shimmering silver scales that were, if its name was to be taken at face value, were made of adamantine. Vaerix snarled as it fully emerged, stepping past Amelia and fixing its silvery, draconic eyes on the evil armor; its fangs were shimmering of the same metal as its scales. Amara stepped back; the armor looked up at the dragon just as one massive claw descended onto the armor, flattening it under the force of its stomp down onto it. The dragon curled its claws around the armor, picking it up, then threw the armor down the street of the ruined city, sending the armor careening away to bounce and flail against the ground as it skipped across the dirt with repeated impacts, rolling and tossing and getting dented along the way until it eventually came to a sliding stop face down. Vaerix then slowly sauntered forward, its imposing wings folded neatly against its back. It took up the entire street with its stride, but naturally stepped over Ellesandra and Amara as it walked past. The armor rose up and grabbed is weapon as it sprinted towards the dragon and made an enthusiastic thrust against one of the dragon's legs. The sword attempted to bite into the scales of the armor, only to...Harmlessly bounce of with a metal *ting*. Vaerix looked down at the armor, unimpressed, then rose up the other arm, balled its talons into a fist, and began to POUND upon the armor again, and again, and again, and again, shaking the ground with each powerful thrust that further pounded the armor into a crater in the ground. The armor clearly had a massive tenacity to withstand stuch strikes, but Amara seemed fine to relax a little and start catching her breath as she wiped sweat from her brow. The armor winning against Vaerix seemed...Exceptionally implausible, after all. But even as she was relaxing and moving back towards Amelia and Star, stepping around the patch of grease, she kept an eye on things, just in case the armor got past the dragon. Her guard was still up, but she seemed confident they had now won. Star similarly wasn't about to preemptively celebrate, though she was looking at Ellesandra with...Exceptional concern.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a little surprised by the sight of Amara just ripping the weapon out from her chest and then healing it. She shouldn't have been, considering the other magical things Amara had done, but still. The failed attempt to rip the mana out of the armor was unfortunate, especially as it left her dazed afterwards. She'd thought she'd prepared herself for it, but the feelings were still there from last time. Her mental guard wasn't up, still reeling from the previous lives she'd just lived, and suddenly she was back in them - experiencing trauma over and over through different eyes. These experiences really, really did not help her with the whole 'oh processing emotions is a positive experience' thing Star was trying to send to her. The thing was, as she lived these lives, she didn't have the ability to take the trauma and repress it like she did with her own; she had to LIVE it. So it was no wonder that Star would be looking at her with concern. Ellesandra, who typically repressed any negative - and some positive - emotions that began to creep up, was cycling through terror, dread, pain, horror, more pain, absolute devastation and depression, all in the matter of moments. Even as she came out of it, this time she wasn't in a position to get back up. She dropped to a knee and gasped, head down and tears streaming down her face. The sound of the dragon being summoned, how it just stepped past her, how Amara began walking back, all of it was white noise. The visions had sent emotions spiraling through Ellesandra that she couldn't just bottle up. Even if she had the presence of mind during each vision to try, there was only so much the bottle could hold and it was already full of Ellesandra's own trauma. So it was here, that she looked defeated. She was a mirror of the defeated version of herself on that card, head bowed, right arm broken and hanging limply to her side, on her knees with her head hung low, bent over with only her left arm holding her up from the ground. Through the fight, strands of her silver white hair had come out of it's ponytail - mostly because of how she'd been tossed - and fell down around her cheek messily, sticking to it as soon as the hair touched her damp face. Her shoulders shook and, unable to either process the feelings and trauma she'd seen, or repress like she normally did, she just sobbed. It was a different sobbing than when Star had last seen her do it, though. This wasn't the personal pain, grief, and guilt that came up before. This was an overwhelmed, unable to process any of the emotions that she'd felt, just pure depression wracking her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was swift to move to Ellesandra's side once she was confident the danger had passed. The pounding of draconic fist against the armor continued, having driven the armor into a three foot crater at this point as life finally stared to seep out of the red mana among the now pancaked pieces of metal. The dragon finished it by rearing its head back, then diving it forward and spewing white flames down onto the armor that spread outwards from the point of impact, glassing the dirt and leaving the armor nothing but a pile of molten wrought iron. The dragon then huffed through its nose, spewing smokey puffs from its nostrils, and moved back to its master, Amelia. Star was at Ellesandra's side at this point as the dragon stepped over them again. She felt she didn't really have room to ask permission this time. Her hands landed on Ellesandra and immediately flooded Ellesandra with the magic of her aura. Where the armor's negative energies poisoned Ellesandra's mind, her mana was a potent healing salve. She closed her eyes, focusing on the energies she felt. She measured her breathing, keeping herself steady as she was exposed to such potent pains. But with her influence, Ellesandra would feel for the first time what happened when Star was actively TRYING to use her powers to affect emotion. It was the same effect that had quashed Ellesandra's nightmares; her presence, her magic, it did not erase the emotion that Ellesandra felt, but it did suffuse the knight with calm. With serenity. Inner peace. The visceral bite of fear, of terror, washed away, replaced by a deep warmth in Ellesandra's heart that whispered tenderly: 'You are safe'. It could not remove the memory of the things Ellesandra felt, but it was able to sever the connection of those emotions from Ellesandra's heart, restoring their own emotion to themselves and allowing their heart to compartmentalize and recognize that these other emotions were not their own. Recognize the outside influence, and restore a sense of self. Star's magic was a direct counter to whatever burned itself into Ellesandra's heart and mind, and the shadowy essence that clung to Ellesandra saw itself purged by the light of her aura resonating with Ellesandra's. One could almost imagine the smirk on the face of the Blood Emerald as Ellesandra suffered under that magic...And just as easily might imagine how quickly it would be taken away as Star so skillfully expunged it and allowed Ellesandra to return to calm. And of course, while Star was there, she was sure to fix Ellesandra's arm, repairing the bones and the bruising, which took far more healing energy than it ought to because of Ellesandra's double-edged ability. Star could already hear her companion advocating for a day, maybe two, maybe a week of rest for Star for daring to put her power to use in healing them. It was just a little nosebleed...
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was in no position to resist Star's touch, or her healing. Even as Star worked, breaking up the connection these felt emotions had on her own, helping soothe and calm, Ellesandra didn't stop sobbing. Her arm was healed, and there was a twinge of annoyance at that way in the back of Ellesandra's mind, but it wasn't anything active or present enough to matter right now. All it changed was how she moved to sit up fully on her knees, raising her hands up to her face and covering it as her shoulders jerked. Star may have separated the emotion felt in the visions from Ellesandra, but once she was sobbing she couldn't just....stop. It was like trying to contain a waterfall, the memory of the man yelling, the arrow hitting her in the back, the desperation at being hanged while innocent, the other deaths and betrayals, sadness and fear. What it did help with, though, was finally being able to push the memories and the feelings that were her own, in response to the memories, back. To slowly begin to gain thought and control again. The desire to seek out comfort, to turn to Star and bury her face in Star's shirt was there, but she didn't. She sat there eyes closed, as the sobs slowly subsided and she was able to wipe away her tear stained cheeks. The summoned dragon had already returned, and as she began to take in the surroundings again, all she could thing was 'well that was overkill'. She couldn't help but feel a little irritation at Amelia; couldn't she have summoned something a little weaker, but faster? The memory of Amara being impaled sent a wave of panic through her though, eyes quickly scanning the area to find Amara, properly healed back up, and then finally back up to Star, noticing the nosebleed. It was only then she remembered that her arm had been healed, and she was moving it around again. "Idiot." She muttered, but there was...affection in the comment. It wasn't meant as an insult, not directly. A minor slap on the wrist type of comment, but also one that wasn't said in any malice. There was appreciation that Star hadn't taken the pain on herself but had used mundane magic to heal her, even if it hadn't been the smartest thing to do at the time in Ellesandra's eyes.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't need Ellesandra to initiate the comfort. She slid her arms around the woman, holding them as best she could with their armor on, to give that comfort. A hand cradled their head and sweet nothings were whispered to them. She continued to pour her influence into the woman, helping them come back to center themselves. Her powers did not control Ellesandra's emotions, but she did have power to guide them back to center, to pour in comfort by the bucket. She knew how to address the worst pains and fears by dousing them with deep-seated warmth that reassured to the contrary. She wasn't in danger. She wasn't being abused. She wasn't being hanged. She wasn't dying. She was okay. Everything was okay. That is what Star's influence reinforced, over and over and over, until emotional stability and peace returned. She didn't lose any of her concern even after enough emotional stability had returned that Ellesandra could stop the tears, however. And being called an idiot in that playfully chiding way just had her smiling. "Idiot, huh? Don't think I can't put together what happened. Trying to absorb the enemy's energy disabled you and then you just go and do it again?" she asked, still smiling as some tears formed in the corner of her eyes. She knew Ellesandra was just fighting however she could figure out how, and to try and save Amara. Truly, she found Ellesandra's tenacity and grit in the moment to be heroic, but she'd dare not say that word around them after last time. The dragon was still summoned, keeping watch over the four adventurers. Vaerix dipped its snout down to brush up against Amelia, who giggled and put a hand under the dragon's chin. "Hey, handsome," she said with affection to the dragon. Amara was holding the spot she was impaled, blood had stained the skin but it didn't seem to be actively bleeding. If the blood was wiped away, there would be no wound to be found, though it was still a bit sore, clearly. Amara certainly was calm, not looking like someone nursing an impalement wound. Amara just surveyed the battlefield, keeping an eye on Ellesandra and Star but allowing them their privacy while scanning for other threats.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra snorted at the comment about her going to absorb the energy again. "Not my smartest idea." She mumbled, her throat sore and raspy from the sobbing. She reached up and once again wiped at her face, having for once not resisted Star's comforting touch when she'd offered it, but as she stabilized more and came back to herself, she slowly moved to stand and pull away from her. There was a hint of shame that crept up, realizing she'd stopped mid-fight to just break down and cry. It had been lucky that Amara had survived that, considering. She remembered what she had told the defeated version of herself, that she would never just lay her weapon down in a fight, yet here Ellesandra was and she had just stopped fighting after seeing those visions, just collapsed to her knees. Shame and guilt swirled, along with anger coming up at herself. "Stupid." She added on, though this time when she was talking about herself, it didn't have the affectionate and joking tone. It was serious, upset that she'd not only put herself in such a position, but risked Amara's well being as part of it. Fully standing, she did a quick look down herself - her weapons laying around her, and the way her armor on her right arm was all scuffed and dented. It would require some work tonight to fix, but it had done it's job of not having her arm be completely shattered at least. A glance was given around, searching for any hints of that shadow again or to see if the Blood Emerald came back at all. "Is...everyone okay?" She whispered this to Star, not feeling comfortable actually asking Amara after the display she'd just put on for them.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wore a small smile. "No, but...Points for trying," she said as she stood up with Ellesandra, helping them by grabbing their rapier and handing it to them while leaving them to retrieve their dagger. Vaerix and Amelia were idly bonding as master and pet might do; one might notice that Amelia used a far more affectionate and sweet tone with her dragon than she had with Ellesandra or Star. A soft side under that harder exterior, perhaps. Star looked at Amelia and Amara, then nodded to Ellesandra, then took it a step further and walked closer to the group to address Amara. She gently bowed to them. "Thank you, Amara. Please, if you need any further healing, let me help," she offered, earning a soft smile from Amara, who seemed to pick up on Star's gentle nature. Amara shook her head. "I might be tapped out for the day, but I'm fine. A shower and bed are what I need now." She then looked over at Ellesandra. "You two can thank me by explaining just what in the nine hells that was about. That asshole of a man obviously knew you, Ellesandra. And while I sincerely doubt you invited him over for a tea party with the rest of us, I can't imagine he's happy about us breaking his toy, and that that might not be the last we see of him once he learns he didn't get what he wanted, which seemed to be stopping you from coming with us."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wanted to roll her eyes, but she didn't want to respond so evidently to Star. Points for trying meant nothing in a fight; it meant you failed, and that could cause you to die. It didn't here, but the self criticism was valid whether or not she got some arbitrary 'points'. She grabbed her dagger and took the rapier from Star as offered, sheathing them both then moving with Star up towards Amara, Amelia, and the imposing dragon. Ellesandra spent a moment eyeing the dragon, both curiously and cautiously. She had no expectation of being able to win in a fight against it, but that didn't stop her from immediately considering how she would go about fighting it if Amelia turned on them for some reason. A habit built out of needing to be prepared for any scenario. Still, when Amara spoke to her, Ellesandra turned her eyes from the dragon over to her. There was hesitation in Ellesandra's response, looking around unsure if anyone would be listening in, and then also at Star. Star had only shared that she was looking to return to her home plane, not to find or save her mother, and that bit of information wasn't Ellesandra's to share. So, she would limit the way she explained it. "Well - he serves someone who goes by the name Black Diamond, and who is responsible for both the reason Star was sent away from home originally, at least I believe so, and resisting her attempting to come back home. For some reason they don't seem capable or willing to communicate to her directly or try to interfere directly with her, so they've chosen to do so with those who have agreed to guard her in the meantime. Her previous bodyguard also received dreams and visions from them, but not Star. I will say, I've been told that they will not be able to bother us while we are in Myst, though. I suspect that is due to the magical block you indicated previously, though once we get to her home realm I'm sure they will be waiting again to ambush or attack us there." Specific, but also pretty vague with a lot of gaps. That would cover the question though, right? And reassure Amara that Myst would be safe.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara listened to the explanation with a few nods. Amelia also paid close attention. Vaerix had noticed Ellesandra eyeing them, but to Vaerix, Ellesandra was about as dangerous as an ant, and there was no reason for them to focus too much on Ellesandra unless Ellesandra threatened Amelia. As they all were clearly allies, Vaerix was content to lay themselves down and coil their tail so that their massive body took up three-quarters of the ruined square in which they stood. A safer place there wasn't likely to be. "What kinda name is that?" asked Amelia rhetorically. "Kinda stupid," she added, folding her arms. Amara smirked at Amelia's attitude, but didn't respond to it. "Aye, something like that. Gods of any sort cannot reach Myst, either as avatars or with their extraplanar interference. The only exception being that magic users whose influence comes from such beings isn't severed, just dampened. That is, paladins, clerics, warlocks, can still commune with such beings, but that influence to those gods or patrons just seems to be coming from nowhere. Myst is sequestered away from the influence of everything except the people who inhabit it. So whomever is trying to communicate with or threaten you will have no luck while you're in Myst. And I dare them to try and come chase you - the dampening field will make them easy prey if they prove to be so stupid." Amara put her spear on her back again, believing that things were finally safe again. Amelia then spoke up, arms folded: "So what makes Star so special, huh?" she asked, looking at Star. "Obviously doesn't seem like they mind killing her, so what's the deal? The explanation leaves a lot of holes as to the 'why' of it all. And that armor was full of an absolute fuckload of mana, so whoever CREATED that thing obviously would need to have a hell of a lot more themselves. Not that I'm complaining about being alive or anything, but it's really not adding up to me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a little amused at Amelia's comment about his name. "Agreed, I chose to call him Die." She didn't add anything about Sapphire - in fact, had she said much about Sapphire to Star? She knew she'd mentioned the name when she shared that her mother was alive, but she hadn't expanded much more beyond that. As Amara continued to comment on the magic and deities and asking more questions, Ellesandra took a deep breath. "They first tried to encourage me not to agree to be her guard and honestly is the main reason I accepted the contract." That was partially news to Star, so Ellesandra looked directly at Amara as she spoke instead of at Star. "They indicated that Star would die on her journey if I stayed with her because she would feel empowered to continue her journey and she would die if she did. Yet if I didn't, she would give up and thus not die." There was a brief pause, and then she added. "Which if you've met Star is wrong. But the reason of the return I leave up to Star to tell, it's not my story to share." And with that, she would turn to look at Star. She wasn't about to share information about her mother without permission, no matter how open Star seemed to be about her emotions and things.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amelia quirked a brow at the nickname. She found that a dumb nickname to pick, but she didn't say it. Amara didn't hold any judgement as she listened. Star, meanwhile, frowned and knit her brow at some point when Ellesandra was talking. Something seemed to bother her about what Ellesandra said. Not offend per se, but...Sting a little. Star spoke up when it was her turn. "I'm what's known as an Auramancer. It's a rare kind of magic. So rare that I've never been able to find anything substantial written about it anywhere, nor know anyone who knows anything about it, other than my mom of course, who is also one like me." She spoke of Aurora in present terms, now that she knew her mother was alive. Amelia looked dumbfounded by this mention of rare magic. Indeed, it was the look that confirmed she'd never heard of it. Amara looked intrigued, and examined Amelia's response as well. "...Well then. As it happens, Myst is also a repository of information. The central structure in Myst is known as the Athenaeum. It has the greatest collection of knowledge in all the multiverse, secured over the past thousand years by the Followers of Myst, like myself and Amelia. If there is anywhere that has information about your magic, it is there. And if it does not? Well...The Followers would greatly appreciate time to ask you questions and study your magic, if you'd allow us." An offer that gave Star pause. Some mild discomfort showed on her face. "I-I'd...Have to think on that."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't notice that Star felt upset about something, having not looked at her most of that. When she did look over, she watched Star explain that they were looking for her mom who knew about Auramancers, but not any information about her mother being captured by Black Diamond. It made her glad she hadn't revealed anything about it. It seemed Amara offered knowledge though about it, which would probably be interesting to Star if they got back from saving her mother. Right now though, she wasn't sure and the discomfort at being asked about her magic was obvious. Ellesandra took a step closer to Star, a protective action that was completely unconscious, but she didn't add anything else herself. This was Star's journey, just her guarding Star; all Ellesandra did was keep an extra eye out now, on alert.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara didn't take offense to Star's hesitation. A calm, motherly smile came upon her. She rose one hand. "Please, don't feel pressured. But do know that the Followers would consider it a great service. That all said, if you are both ready, I believe we should away to Myst properly before anything else decides to come attack us," said Amara, looking to Star and Ellesandra for confirmation. There were a few things to settle on the matter, like how much gold to take out, which was something that had Star looking with some measure of uncertainty at Ellesandra to help her figure out.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over to Star and then, after another wary glance over at the two Myst natives and the dragon, she turned entirely to Star. "Perhaps we can get what we'd normally spend in a month's time for room and board, times two? I don't know how much we will need, but that should be plenty enough to cover it without us getting everything out. And anything else that you feel like you would like. We can add it to my pack or get you a pack while we're in town to add." Since Star had just been using her magical storage she knew she would need a pack of her own, but it could be a small pack so Star didn't have to carry too much. Ellesandra probably wouldn't let her, if Star didn't insist on it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star considered the notion for a moment. She truly didn't expect there to be much worry about being thievery, but she couldn't deny her companion's desire for caution. So she summoned the coinpurse and her bedroll, the bedroll going to Ellesandra to put on their pack as they had mentioned it would, with the coinpurse also being handed to them. "If someone's going to try and take it, they're more likely to think twice if they have to go through you to get it," she said with a light smile, though something still seemed to be bothering her behind that smile. The simple bag of coins with its leather strap to pull it closed had fifteen platinum in it. A hundred and fifty gold. If the prices in Myst were higher than standard, it would cover their costs. If the prices were standard, it would give them a little extra wiggle room for the month, assuming they pulled in no money from work or other means. Amelia felt the need to chime in: "You ought to just get a Bag of Holding while you're in the city. There's only like a hundred bazillion of them on the markets."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She would take her pack around to strap the bedroll to it properly, and then with the bag of coins would tuck it and strap it against the dagger sheathe beneath her armored skirt. A glance was given to Amara at the mention of using a bag of holding and she would shrug, leaving that up to Star. It was Star's money, after all, and Ellesandra didn't find a need for such a magic item for most of her journeys. She'd noticed the light smile seemed odd, but Ellesandra did not have the empathy and insight to be able to easily identify something was off. Instead, she got everything set up on the pack and slung it back over her left shoulder, looking between Star and Amara. "I think we're ready then. I must share that magical effects don't effect me well, so if this is any form of travel that is not a simple portal or something to this realm, you may find it more difficult." Ellesandra had never been successfully teleported somewhere before, though she had used a portal before.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I think we're all fine to keep standard with portals," said Amara, then looked to Amelia. Amelia moved over to Vaerix and moved to touch her forehead to Vaerix's snout. "I'll call on you again when I need you, Vaerix. Go be free again," she said, and with those words, the dragon began to shimmer blue and slowly fade away into sparkling lights that flicked out of existence again. A slow process, one that Amelia had a little faint bittersweet smile about her while letting the dragon return to wherever it was going. The bond Amelia had with her summons seemed to be quite strong. She did still have the two floating orbs about her, which squeaked some sort of utterance that was unintelligible to all but Amelia. Amelia then sighed and pushed her hand slowly forward. Four magical lights shot out from her palm, forming the four corners of a rectangular portal that then flooded with magic to create a swirling blue mist that had runes floating about in the magical storm. Amelia looked behind her at the other three and nudged her head. Amara followed, looking once over her shoulder to ensure the others were following. Star took in a deep breath, then joined along with the others after nodding to Ellesandra. When the group passed through the portal, the entirety of Myst was bared before them. It was not a wilderness. It was not earth they set their feet upon, but ceramic tile. They stood on the other side of the portal upon a floating disc attached to a long, long bridge that moved into a central series of platforms that all floated above a lofty bed of clouds way down below. Standing tall in the middle of it all was presumably the Athenaeum of which the Followers of Myst had spoken. A grand building that breached upwards into the cloudless, sunny sky. The time in this realm looked to be identical to what it was before they passed through the portal. The sun was in the same position in the sky, and indeed night would fall in due time despite this place clearly being entirely artificial. It had not occurred naturally. It was not the product of a god. No, the floating discs which where supported by golden, metal hemispheres below them that made for a collection of half-spheres floating together, suspended by bright violet magical crystals that were so massive in size as to make one surely assume each crystal in itself had mana enough to equal a hundred accomplished mages. Outer walls surrounded the city, and the faint sheen of a magical barrier could be seen extending from above the walls up to encapsulate the entire city, including the massive Athenaeum in the middle. There were dots that they could see around the walls, guards presumably, but the distance was long enough that details would be lost on them. A solid ten minute walk from portal to city along a bridge wide enough to support about five or six walking side by side. The bridge was sturdy, and no crosswinds threatened to send anyone careening into the cloudy abyss below. There were also guard rails, naturally, though there didn't seem to be anything stopping someone from just picking another person up and throwing them into what at least appeared to be certain doom. But with such strong magic at work, surely there was another answer. Amara and Amelia began towards the city proper, with Star following only once she looked at Ellesandra to ensure everything was good with them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited, moving to step in last unless Amelia looked like she needed to stay out to maintain the portal. She stayed near Star though, following in with her just to make sure nothing happened to cut them off from one another. When they arrived in Myst, her eyes did a quick scan around to assess for danger first. There didn't seem to be any, but she was still on guard in a completely strange and new land. Her next focus was identifying what defenses she could see in the city, the walls and what looked like guards on them, before taking a moment to appreciate how lovely and magical it all looked. Star's look back at her got her simply nodding to reinforce that all seemed well, but she would follow along behind, looking back at the bridge and then up towards the city. "May I ask, is there anything culturally we should be aware of? Any customs we should follow to ensure we do not unintentionally offend or make enemies in town? You've mentioned not drawing a weapon of course, but that is quite common."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I should hope that one is common, unless you keep company among orcs and goblins," said Amara with a chuckle. "Culturally? Hm..." Amara thought for a moment. "Respect for knowledge is paramount in Myst. The Athenaeum is the culmination of a thousand years of work to diligently maintain records of the written word. Everything from culture, to arcana, to the finest recipes for freshwater fish you've ever known, every effort is made to acquire, preserve, and maintain that knowledge. The Followers of Myst seek to enlighten all others they meet. If there is any questions you have, any thirst for answers you possess, it is one of the missions of the Followers of Myst to aide you in finding the answers you seek. In return, whatever knowledge, whatever skill you have, should be shared with any who wish to know it, insofar as it does not burden you unduly. I saw how you fight. You may find a great many others like you here in the Athenaeum's martial halls. Those who would bear training weapons with you either to teach or be taught by you," explained Amara, though also had Amelia chip in her two cents: "Could also stand to come to learn how to properly cast a Haste spell," she said with a huff. "No doubt you're burning your muscles raw with the way you cast it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra nodded along to what Amara said. There was a tinge of excitement that came up at the idea of exchanging weapon lessons, but it was oddly quickly diminished if Star was paying attention to it. When Amelia chipped in regarding her haste spell, Ellesandra looked amused and tilted her head to the side. "Oh, well if they can I would love to see that, considering I don't cast spells the way most people do. You see most haste spells end after a minute and mine can last for as long as my body and energy can maintain it. I think the longest I've used it for is five minutes before, though I admit I was recovering for two weeks afterwards." Ellesandra would love to learn ways to improve the efficiency of her spells, but with her unique resistance most magical effects didn't work right on her. Other spells that improved her defenses or speed, when cast upon her by other magic users, hardly effected her just like healing did. When Ellesandra cast her own spells, she did so in a way that pulled on her physical strength over her magical, which is why it effected her so. She considered potentially practicing with a mage who could help with that, but being the only one she was aware of who had such resistance, she wasn't sure if someone could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star frowned when she saw the excitement go away. No, no bring that back, hold onto that! She puffed out a cheek, though nobody would really understand why except maybe Ellesandra. Amelia raised a brow at the response. "And you think that's a...Good...Thing?" she asked, her eyes quietly assessing if Ellesandra was crazy. "Listen. Whatever it is about the way you cast, I'm certain it's documented. Arcana of all kinds is the most populated subject in Myst, and subject to the most rigorous study." Amelia seemed quite confident in her assessment, and being that she seemed so comfortable with the arcane it would be easy to believe her, but time would tell who was right. It did at least sound like there were people all around this place that would be able to support Ellesandra in refining their skills, if nothing else. Amara then continued: "Aside from culture, be aware of two things: First, there are a race of elves who live only in Myst. Their homeland was destroyed, and the last of their kind act as the royal guard of Myst. They are known as the Arethi elves. Respect Myst, don't litter, don't deface anything, and I'm sure you'll get along just fine with them. Inside the city, you'll also see automatons walking around. Headless suits of armor that are vaguely like...Fifteen feet tall or so. They just patrol around and act to keep the peace. They are good at not trampling people, but I'd still recommend giving them the right of way as they move around. You'll also even if you don't stay long want to ensure you visit the main office of the library in the Athenaeum to get yourself a library card. You'll need it to borrow books of course, but also it acts as a key to allow you to make portals back to Myst. And, well, if after spending a bunch of time here you feel so inclined, the Followers of Myst is an open guild. Membership in the guild may prove fruitful to you, though of course that is a personal choice for you both to make." Amelia scoffed. "You know you don't have to try and recruit EVERYONE you meet into the guild, right captain?" said Amelia. Amara chuckled in response. "Not everyone. Just the ones who fight well," she said with a brief flash back to Ellesandra and Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star would see a bit of irritation and defensiveness at Amelia's words. It wasn't that Amelia was right or wrong, it was just how she seemed to assume Ellesandra's magic. Ellesandra was most certainly not versed in magic like Amelia, but there was this kind of arrogant attitude that rubbed her a bit wrong. She didn't dwell on it though, just like the excitement that had been felt earlier it was pushed down, and she nodded. A glance was given over to Star at the comment about the library card and getting back. "We should probably do that, but beyond that I think our main goal is finding a way to get back to your realm, right Star? I don't suppose we'll be staying in the city long on this trip, though any trip back we might have more free time to explore these...archives and the guild you mention." Ellesandra had no interest in joining a guild, and she was sure Star probably didn't right now either, though if she decided to come back to Myst afterwards that might change on her part. No, now their mission was just to find a way to get to Star's home realm, which if there weren't things like portals easily accessible for different realms, they could probably find within the archives. If things went well, they would be at best here for a day or two before being on their way, in Ellesandra's mind. She was also assuming Star would agree on the rush, but that might not be entirely true based on the need in the city.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  As the two continued their walk, they would see that multiple 'arms' like the one they walked upon - bridges that shot out into the cloudy distance at the edges of the realm - were spread off from the main city with meticulously equidistant space between each. They also would have felt the initial tingle of the dampening field the moment they walked in, but by this point its effects were fully felt. A suppression of their magic, squashed down to the tiniest degree. Magic was still there, and Ellesandra would still be able to feel their ability to use it, but it was so utterly miniscule under this effect. Ellesandra's haste spell rather than lasting five minutes would last less than a tenth of a second before fizzling out, and would not hasten them to any discernable degree. It was a method to ensure that things that required magic to function did not break apart or crumble, such as wands or enchanted items. Their magic still sustained, but its ability to do anything was suppressed. So one might wonder if Star could still see emotion with this field pushing down on her. Looking at her, she didn't seem at all very different. Just idly took in the sight of the city as they approached. They neared the wall at this point, which allowed Ellesandra to get a better look at the guards. The Arethi that had been spoken of - juggernauts of elven kind, these guards stood in the range of eight feet tall, and each wore suits of deep purple armor that looked several inches thick in all parts. The bulk of it certainly had to weigh a hundred, two or maybe three hundred pounds on its own. Yet these Arethi, with their pale midnight skin and bright white hair seemed unfazed. Two stood at the gate into the city brandishing massive halberds that had enough metal on the ends to break bones with impact if the blade didn't just cleave clean through their enemy. Upon the rampart of the wall walked archers wielding greatbows - bows that were themselves ten feet from tip to tip and thick enough to allow for absurd amounts of pressure in the draw of the thick metal string, if it could even be called a string. Quivers for these held what would more easily be considered lances that ought to be held by knights on horseback jousting, instead fired like ballista bolts. Of course, the elves above and at the gates were simply on idle watch. Halberds were held at their sides and straight up as their eyes scanned. Archers idly used their massive bows more as walking sticks. It was an intimidating sight to many, but also a reassuring one. There was nothing but pity for whatever might come to Myst with hostile intent if that was the opposition. The elves at the gate would do little more than offer nods of acknowledgement at the party of four if eye contact was made. Else, they just remained on guard, indifferent to the travelers. Once the group stepped into the city itself, it immediately showcased an aesthetic of mathematic precision. The blocks of buildings had equal space between them that lined up from block to block, such that if one looked at the gaps between buildings, it formed a line of sight that went on for as long as the curvature of the circular city permitted before seeing the interior of the wall in that direction. The city was split into sections, floating discs that had been observed from afar. Each was grand in size, but to traverse from one disc to another, one had to cross on a set of two bridges. One for each direction, clearly labeled to ensure logical flow of foot traffic. Some of the buildings were homes - the group seemed to arrive in a residential district, indeed, as it was decorated with trees and greenery and had amenities for children to play on - while others in the distance were clearly businesses. The low rumble of a trade district that was vaguely west of them could be heard. Moving through the city was a consistent motion of walking straight, then turning ninety degrees if needed, and walking straight again until another ninety degree turn was needed. There were no curved roads, save for the outer rim of each disc that supported the buildings. Everything was very...Square. Precise. Intentional. A design iterated a trillion times before a single brick was laid. Each disc had enchanted ceramic tiles to walk upon. Not the softest thing to land on if one stumbled, surely, but made for a pretty, pristine look. Not overly reflective, and not a spec of dirt to be seen upon it. It also didn't *clack* like ceramic should when walked upon. Steps were muted, as if walking on soft earth. All many details to take in as the group entered, things that Star certainly seemed to be eager to drink in with her wandering gaze, though naturally the two guild members were quite used to the sight. Star did nod to Ellesandra's words. "Mmnh, I think I'll need to visit the library to figure that part out specifically. So while you're welcome to join me, it feels a bit wasteful with all the things that are apparently available that you could use your time to enjoy in the meanwhile. Either way, I do agree that I'm sure we'll be on our way again before long."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was much more interested in the defenses of the town than she was the beauty and well-designed architecture or layout of the paths. Her eyes scanned over the walls, watching the archers and the guards curiously. There wasn't any hostile intent; she wasn't necessarily looking for weaknesses or anything, but more taking in how they did things here and comparing it to the little she knew about setting up defenses for a castle. She'd never been in a command position so she hadn't been privy to a lot of that information, but you picked some things up just being a guard in general. As they entered into the city itself, passing the guards and the walls, she finally had begun looking around at the city itself. There was an...efficiency to it, that was both impressive and disappointing. The logical mindset that things seemed to have been laid out was certainly efficient and probably better overall, but to Ellesandra it seemed to take away a bit of the...life of the feel. So clean, proper, and intentional with no room for mistakes, as close to perfection as the city could probably get. Something about it just sat wrong with her, but she didn't really know what or care to examine it; no one was asking her opinion about the city anyways. When Star spoke up about going to the library and ellesandra being free to enjoy her time, there was an indignant shock that coursed through her. She looked at Star as if Star had just grown two more heads. "Star, do you really think I am going to go off to do my own thing while we're in a strange city neither of us know well surrounded by strangers? Just because Black Diamond has indicated they can't get to you here, doesn't mean the Cult of the Faust or whatever they were called can't, or any other number of natural enemies and threats a city might have." She paused, glancing over to Amelia and Amara. "no offense intended." They seemed quite proud and protective of their city, but that didn't mean that any city didn't have it's own dangers to strangers.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star blinked and threw her hands up in defense at Ellesandra's words. "Hey! I'm just trying to give you a chance to not be bored out of your skull. I won't complain if you come look at books with me all day," she said, offering a small smile. "It was just a thought. Not everything needs to revolve around me you know," she added, lowering her hands again. Star wasn't nearly as paranoid as Ellesandra, for better or worse. She cared more about Ellesandra enriching themselves than her getting into a bit of trouble that might have otherwise been avoided, but she could surmise that Ellesandra felt quite different. Amara just chuckled at Ellesandra's words. "None taken, Ellesandra. There's not much crime here, but it's not like there's zero. She said she was your guard, right Star? Let her do her job then. Even if the Followers would join to aide you if something happened, there's something to be said about your knight's strong gaze and the ability of such a thing to deter a would-be criminal before they even act," was Amara's contribution to the topic. Amelia, meanwhile, focused on something else: "Cult of Faust? Jeez. How many enemies have you two made? I'm almost impressed."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
To be fair, Ellesandra had only made enemies by following and protecting Star. In reality, they were Star's enemies, and she still wasn't entirely sure why. She just shook her head at Star. "If it will make you feel better, I'll request books about magic while I'm with you so I'm not, as you say, revolving around you. And so Amelia doesn't give me the scolding she would a five year old who performs magic poorly." There was wry amusement in her tone, considering it was literally her job to revolve around Star. She also tried to alleviate some of the tension she felt between herself and Amelia. Or maybe that was all on her side? Either way, a cursory glance was given around to ensure there was no one following them or close by to overhear, before she continued in regards to the Cult of Faust. "As for the Cult, they're allies of Die is all. I'm not sure if they particular care about finding Star or not, but if they're allies Die may send them after us as well, since they can't seem to get into Myst themselves for whatever reason." A brief explanation without needing to go into it. Important for Amara and Amelia to know in case something went down, but just the 'need to know' type information. She would look back to Star, checking in that her sharing this would be okay; it was Star's journey after all. She didn't want to overshare anything Star would prefer to keep to herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Ellesandra's discretion was thoughtful, Star clearly had no issues with Ellesandra sharing. Truly, Star didn't care what Ellesandra shared about her among allies. She was a very trusting individual, and if information passed by Ellesandra's scrutiny of needing to share, it had already done that and more by Star. She didn't say as much, but the pleasant expression she had might make Ellesandra question why they were being discreet in the first place. "Hey captain, looks like she's not hopeless after all," said Amelia with a grin while looking at Ellesandra. The same attitude was in her voice as with all the things she said. There didn't seem to be tension. Maybe Amelia was just a brat? Amara just shook her head, clearly used to Amelia's attitude. Star did seem to find it a good compromise. "Mn, well, as long as you aren't feeling like your time is being wasted, I'm content," said Star, keeping her usual air of care for Ellesandra alive and well. "I wouldn't be able to guarantee you that no such activity exists in this place," began Amara. "But if any cultists are among the peoples here, they'll be little more than listening ears and watching eyes, for the moment they try anything more they'll find it a quick way to taste the ceramics below our feet." As she said this, one of the previously mentioned automatons crossed their path. Amara and Amelia stopped in their stride briefly as the hulking, ten foot tall suit of armor walked past with mechanical rigidity. The headless suit of armor shone with a polished, silvery sheen, and seemed to be doing little more than just walking around, being a presence. Two small purple crystals with gold bands around the central bulge of the rhomboidal shapes followed behind the automaton. One briefly moved over to the group of four, with a purple orb of mana appearing vaguely in the shape of a stylized eye above it that 'looked' at Ellesandra, then Star, each for a second or two, before rejoining the other crystal in following the automaton. "Scrying sensors, before you ask," said Amelia with her usual attitude. "They check for any nefarious magic, or shady deeds. You never know when one's watching, which does a great deal to get anyone with ill intentions nice and paranoid." With that brief lecture over, the group resumed their walk towards the athenaeum.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra still felt uneasy sharing information, even despite Star's apparent trusting attitude. she'd been trained too well to keep her client's secrets. The idea of her time being wasted by just keeping guard around Star made her shake her head again. "It's not wasted time, it's my job, Star. Unless you think my job is a waste of time?" The poke, daring Star to say that Ellesandra job was a waste, was a tease of course. She knew Star appreciated that Ellesandra was there, unpaid in reality but either way still there doing her job, even if she didn't think it was necessary all the time. A simple nod was given to Amara at the explanation, eyes scanning the large automaton up and down as it passed. It was interesting, and probably an efficient guard against many things in the city, but she had to wonder what controlled it and what would happen if someone or something somehow took control of them away from the city. It sounded like a disaster waiting to happen, but that same risk was there if there were people in charge of protection so, maybe not necessarily a higher risk than any other setup. "The question is, if we're intended to share knowledge in exchange for it, Star, what do you suggest we offer? Beyond my training, I'm not sure I've got any particular information that might be worth a lead on the right portal to your realm, and I'm sure you have no desire to put more information about your magic out there while you're still figuring it out yourself?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star gave a playful squint at Ellesandra for the tease. "Listen, you," she said with a giggle, not really having any follow up to that but just making it even more obvious that Ellesandra couldn't be further from the truth. She then looked...A little surprised, pleasantly so, at Ellesandra's question. She nodded. "Mn, that's right." The surprise seemed to stem from the fact that Ellesandra was able to know exactly how Star felt about it without her having had to explain it at all. It wasn't the biggest mystery in the world, but there was a...Subtle blush to her cheeks in the wake of this. "It needn't be anything novel," chimed in Amara. "There remain many novices, people willing and wanting to learn. Passing knowledge or skill is a service, and such service is returned in kind. Knowledge for knowledge. If you do find yourself pressed to provide, I'm certain that an agreement can be made for your service in instructing others in the way of the blade, or Star instructing in the way of the arcane." A prospect that had Star looking...Quite nervous indeed. The two drew closer to the athenaeum, and its grandness only became more apparent as they crossed the bridge to the central disc that housed it. It was imposing. A structure to dwarf even grand castles, its exterior made of some pristine white stone. Unlike the square and precise rest of the city, the athenaeum carried a far more...Mystic air about it. Asymmetries, curves, and decorative adornments abounded upon the exterior. The main entrance before them was a large series of steps up to what was a gaping maw of an entryway. Massive pillars stood dozens of feet apart as the main entry just seemed to go up, and up, and up...It had a way of making one feel so utterly small and insignificant in its grand scale. Once stepping in, the vertical magnitude was preserved as steps went down into the main floor of the front foyer of the athenaeum. Squared rooms could seen lining one wall with lights on in some, off in others. The other wall was a wall of bookshelves that, by itself, surely contained a million books, if not much more. Magical orbs floated up and around on this wall of books, magically retrieving them at the request of clerks that flew the books back down to ground level where a myriad of people were requesting or returning works. Desks upon desks upon desks upon desks were laid out in precise uniformity to allow any who walked in to perform their study with the requested work. Of course, the athenaeum went deeper than this opening room. The grand opening hall had a dizzying number of branching paths off it, ascending, descending, going left and right, with teleportation circles drawn on some rooms to the sides of the hall that were clearly labeled with both a numbering system that followed some decimal logic, but deciphering whether one needed to go to 1.13: Alchemical Reagents or 1.92: Botanical Specimens or 2.87: Cardiovascular Conditioning or 101.22: Archival Nexus was an intimidating prospect that would make getting lost all too easy. Splitting up certainly seemed like a bad idea not because of being attacked, but for the risk of never finding each other ever again. Or even being able to find one's way back to the entrance again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She'd assumed there was a reason that Star's family didn't share their magic widely. To share that information at a place where people came to study a lot seemed like a good way to put a spotlight on them and their unique abilities. It also seemed like a good way to put a target on Star's back. Not to mention she'd seemed to hold information back about her mother, Ellesandra had just been assuming. The surprise on Star's face didn't even register though. She'd begun looking around again, considering. She hadn't taken a student since Marigold, and the memory of that sent a pang of grief going through her, but it was contained and minimal. Could she take another student, even if it was just one or two lessons while they were in the city? That was an option, and after glancing at Star and seeing how nervous she looked, probably one of the more likely options. As they approached the athenaeum, Ellesandra took some time to appreciate it's size and impressive structure. She wasn't an artist or an architect, but she could tell something like this was impressive. There was also something lovely about the asymmetries in it, compared to how structured and efficiently designed the city was. She appreciated the curves and how it wasn't all...box-like, straight lines. Her gaze turned up, her 5'1 form feeling even smaller in comparison to it, before glancing over to Star with concern as they saw the inside. It would be all too easy to lose Star around a corner or something, and spend hours searching for her charge without being able to find her. That thought made her step up closer to Star, to ensure something like that didn't happen. If there was someone here who knew this building well from years of travelling it, they would likely be able to easily run from Ellesandra in here and get away; she didn't want anyone to do that having kidnapped Star for whatever reason.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked at Ellesandra briefly when they stepped closer. A small smile graced her lips. Though it might have been something Ellesandra didn't think about, or perhaps they did, Star still was able to see emotions even with the oppressive dampening field upon them all. Her auramancy remained unaffected, though she wasn't about to announce as much until the two were in private. "All right, well. I guess this is where we figure out what we're doing," said Amelia, arms crossed. She turned then to look at Star and Ellesandra. "After that fight, I'm tapped out, so I'll be combat ineffective for the next few days. So if you want a guide for the day so you don't get lost, I've -- well, I DO have better things to do, but the thought of you two getting lost is too sad." Something about this attitude had Star giggling. A giggle that had Amelia stiffening a little and looking away with a tint of red on her cheeks. Star clearly knew something; a small reminder that it wasn't just Ellesandra's emotions that Star could see. Amara just planted her clean, non-bloodied hand on Amelia's head and rubbed, evoking some sputters from the shorter of the two women. "Your offer is appreciated I'm sure, Amelia. I'll be going to my quarters to clean up, but once I'm back in civilian clothes I can join you all again, if you don't mind the company. Though if you two would prefer to go it alone, you can always rely on the magical guide for the Athenaeum. Her name is Capi. Just preface her name with 'pardon me' or 'excuse me' or a greeting and she'll show up somewhere nearby to help guide you around. Talking to her can be a bit stiff, but you get used to it." Whether taking the offered guidance of the locals or this 'Capi', it was useful knowledge regardless that there was some sort of guidance for this labyrinthine archive. Star looked at Ellesandra, a look that asked for their opinion on the matter.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra noticed the small smile, and hadn't even considered whether or not Star's ability would be effected by this. She'd just assumed it wasn't, for some reason. Maybe because it wasn't typical arcane magic, and Ellesandra just...knew that? Either way, she glanced over to Amelia as she spoke, watching the suggestion that she had better things to do. There was a small bit of annoyance again, but Ellesandra didn't show it so that only Star would notice. She wasn't sure if Amelia was just being a type of brat who says they hated something but truly liked it or wanted to do it, or if she legitimately just had that attitude. Considering Star giggling, Ellesandra glanced between the two and then sighed. Being led around by Amelia didn't exactly sound like the best time in the world, but their explanation of this odd magical guide put Ellesandra on edge. Definitely preferred living company that she relatively trusted not to backstab them, considering Amelia and Amara had fought beside them without question, to a magical guide that might have...uncertain allegiances or ability to corrupt. When Star looked at her for the suggestion, Ellesandra shrugged. "It's your decision. My vote would be for the two we trust over some random guide, though I certainly wouldn't want to put them out if they have much better things to be doing." This last bit was directed at Amelia and Ellesandra looked towards her, a single eyebrow raising. She was taking the giggle from Star as evidence to call Amelia on her faux reason that they were such a bother. "I'm sure we'd be able to find our way eventually, or ask someone else. Star is quite good with people." While Ellesandra was the typical person who didn't ask for directions unless she absolutely needed to.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star glanced at Ellesandra with an amused smile. While it was true that she was good with people, to know that Ellesandra was coming to rely on her for as much was...Cute. She had to wonder what Ellesandra would do had she not been here, or in some alternate reality where she was even grumpier than Ellesandra. She imagined they would get by, of course. But it more had her wondering if her people skills were a minor convenience or as far as a crutch for Ellesandra. A question left unasked as Ellesandra's comment evoked a small fluster and blush from Amelia, who crossed her arms in defiance. "It's FINE," said Amelia emphatically. "Someone's gotta help you before you go wandering around getting lost. And I'd not trust half the people who even live here to know what they're talking about, so it can't be helped," she continued, which if Ellesandra looked at Star would see that Star was having a difficult time containing herself. A hand even went over her own lips to keep herself silent. Yes, Star could see straight through Amelia's tough front, and apparently saw something worth smiling about underneath it all. Amelia took the opportunity to turn and walk further into the athenaeum. "Come on, we need to get to the main office so you can meet the head librarian and get your cards. Don't fall behind, either!"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra held back the smirk that wanted to play at Amelia's response. The thought in the back of her mind was 'i bet she's a bratty sub for Amara', and a quick glance was given to Amara, but Ellesandra didn't voice any of this. There was a brief moment when she wondered how much of that thought Star could see, which caused her to glance over to Star as well, a bit sheepishly, but she reminded herself Star couldn't read minds, just emotion. And Ellesandra had been amused, but not horny or anything like that, so she wasn't going to be able to tell, right? She hoped that's how the auramancy worked anyways; she had enough issues with the idea of Star reading her emotions. "Thank you, oh benevolent native citizen lowering yourself to help bumbling tourists like us." The words weren't said for Amelia to hear, more just mumbled to herself in that same amusement. Ellesandra was latching onto the amusement as a positive emotion right now, something to focus on rather than the...well...everything that she'd experienced in the memories just before coming here. It was a distraction, a way to help her push those down without focusing on them. As they were encouraged not to fall behind, Ellesandra began walking behind Amelia and following her, her main focus being on Star to ensure that Star followed as well and didn't get lost in any shuffling.

  Amara met the look, but it wasn't the look of someone who was trying to communicate that she was involved with Amelia, but rather the look of a big sister who was light-heartedly apologizing for her little sister being such a brat. "Your bedside manner is as exemplary as ever, Amelia," said Amara as they began walking. There wasn't too much worry about getting lost in a crowd; there were lots of people, certainly, but the athenaeum was just so...Big. There was too much room for people to keep distant, and the way everything was laid out encouraged orderly passage to get from one place to the next. Star caught Ellesandra's mumbling and put a hand over her mouth to snicker to herself. She made a passing comment for just Ellesandra to hear: "She doesn't have an ounce of conviction behind that attitude. She's SUCH a softie." Ellesandra seemed to have picked up on it themselves, but the happy mood left her happy to joke about it a bit more. Star also had been giving a look - THAT look - at Amara a few times as they were together. She seemed to see...something. But she didn't say anything about whatever she saw. The group moved through the athenaeum's main hall to arrive at a collection of magical circles, each in its own inset into the wall of the circular room. Each circle was labeled; the two fluffy-eared guides moved to the circle labeled 100.1: Library Services. Amelia simply touched her foot to the circle, and an opaque, square blue portal opened in the wall behind it. The inset in the wall and portal were quite large, about twenty feet up and across. The whole of the athenaeum did seem to be built to accommodate larger individuals. When the group stepped through the portal, the receiving section had its own series of other circles that led to different places, but they were not heading to such places. Instead, they moved down a short passage to arrive at what appeared to be the central administration of the athenaeum. Massive glass windows poured in sunlight from the wall to the side of the desk, adjacent to the inlet room they walked in from. The windows also gave a sense of height; seemed they were much, much higher up now. A brief jaunt over to look out the window would reveal quite a moment of vertigo as the ground floor was dozens of floors below them now, enough that people were now but black dots. And yet, from outside it was clear there was much higher the building could go. Regardless, a semi-rounded desk made of exquisite wood and beautiful detailing that etched runes and glyphs of all sort of arcana into the front panel was before them, with piles of books seen in neat and organized and labeled collections behind on some other tables, a section that was blocked by the desk itself and the adjoining walls. For staff only, of course. Amelia and Amara came up to the desk. There was nobody present initially, though a woman with shimmering red hair which swept over one eye soon walked into view holding a stack of books which she set into one of the other piles, scrawled a little note on some parchment she had sitting nearby, then moved to the seat behind the desk. The woman had very visible scars upon her face and arms, though her long sleeves did attempt to hide the scarring on her arms, and her hair attempted to do the same with the one over her eye. It didn't conceal them enough to avoid them being visible, but it was clear she was...Trying to hide them. Enough that it was obviously something she wasn't wanting to talk about, though with them being so bright against her pale skin it was equally obvious she knew people noticed them despite her attempts to conceal them. Amara smiled at the woman. "Good day, Serenity. We've brought you some people in need of library cards," said Amara, earning a smile from Serenity as she looked at Star and Ellesandra. She then briefly looked aside and grabbed a black slate from a wooden drawer behind the desk. She laid the slate upon the top of the desk. It had bright purple runes etched into it in a circle that was sized to be large enough to accommodate a palm within the magical circle upon it. She then produced two copies of parchment with paired inkwells and writing quills. "Splendid," began Serenity. "If you could please, just a few formalities to square away," she said, gesturing to the papers. The papers had been prepared to request basic information. Name, first, last, and middle. Age. Race. Gender. Though the one that one might not expect to see was 'Plane of residence'. The implication was clear that Star and Ellesandra were to complete the forms before getting the cards; Star moved up to the desk, having no qualms with the process.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The apologetic look didn't do anything, along with the comment from Amara, to make Ellesandra think anything other than them being involved. it was possible that they weren't, but the vibe was there. Maybe it was only one directional? Ellesandra didn't know, she didn't have the insight that Star did or the ability to just read people well. Still, she followed along, glancing sidelong at Star at the comment about Amelia being a softy. There was a moment of...displeasure. A squinting of the eyes and a general feeling of unease and discomfort with Star sharing something about someone's emotions. It was a very minor thing, considering Star was just sharing that she was a softie, and that was something Ellesandra had kind of already worked out anyways, but the idea behind it was more what bothered Ellesandra. She didn't comment, though she knew she didn't need to in order for Star to see that she hadn't been comfortable with it. Ellesandra was big on boundaries, and she still maintained that seeing people's emotions like Star did was an unintentional invasion of them. Sharing what she saw with Ellesandra seemed a step further - that bit Star could control. But as soon as the discomfort settled in, she knew Star would see it and if she didn't say something would retreat and feel bad about herself again - at least if she was able to tell what caused it. "It's okay." Ellesandra muttered, trying to reassure Star before that could happen. But before she could go further, they found themselves opening a portal of some kind, or at least some sort of light that Amelia triggered. Ellesandra went into guard mode, eyeing the portal and the surroundings suspiciously and with caution, distracted from what she was going to say. As they approached the central administration, still on guard, she turned her eyes to the apparent librarian, Serenity. There was recognition of the scars, but other than a small amount of curiosity at what caused them Ellesandra didn't respond. She wasn't going to ask - it certainly wasn't her place - and she wasn't going to feel sorry for the woman. She probably got that plenty from the general public, anyways. When paper was handed over, she glanced over to Star to ensure everything seemed okay with her, and then stepped up after her when Star moved up to complete the forms. Ellesandra Rhinelander, no middle name. Human, to the best of her knowledge. Woman, AFAB, She/Her. She put down her plane of residence and the other basic information necessary, only stopping momentarily halfway through to glance around and ensure that no one was approaching while the two were busy filling out paperwork.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It didn't matter that Ellesandra said it was okay. It suddenly was anything but okay. The dour mood struck Star like a spear, and she wasn't likely to have anything else to say for a good long while. So there was nothing else to do but follow along in her silence as they moved to the administration. Some minor notice had been taken of how Star went from bright giggles to very visibly neutral at best, upset at worst. But nobody but Ellesandra was close enough to her to interject or ask about it. They went through the motions, filled things out and handed them back to Serenity. "Good, good," she said, looking over the paperwork and finding it to be in order. "Now if you could please place your hand upon the black slate there, one at a time, it will imprint your magical signature upon your card. This is done to ensure only you are able to use the card for transit back to Myst." Once more, something that Star did without any notable hesitation. The sigils glowed when she rest her palm upon it, and Serenity seemed busy with some magical process at the same time that resulted in all of the details and the signature being transcribed onto a small metal card which bore a small purple gem inset into the card in the corner of it. Once the process was done, Star was handed her card which had all the details that were written out. She held onto it for the moment as she stepped aside, letting Ellesandra repeat the process assuming they had no objection to doing so.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	The guilt was immediate, with how Star seemed to shut right the hell up. She'd been giggly at looking at Amelia before, and now Ellesandra's own discomfort had caused her to shut down. She'd clenched her jaw, not sure how to make it better since the immediate 'it's fine' obviously hadn't worked. She wasn't good at this shit, and it didn't help that she knew that now Star was seeing both her guilt, and frustration at a combination of the situation and herself. That only led into a bit more of frustration, but that was a repeating cycle Ellesandra wouldn't let herself go down right now. She'd watched the magical imprint happening on Star first, eyes wary, but when Star stepped back to let Ellesandra repeat the process she did so. She focused on the task and making sure that she wasn't intentionally absorbing any magic from the process, unsure how it would work on her but willing it to work as best it can, stepping back when finished and looking at Serenity to silently confirm if everything had gone through fine. While doing so, she reached out and lightly wrapped her fingers around Star's upper arm. It was a gentle squeeze before release, knowing physical touch helped reassure Star more than words ever would, and it not exactly being a place that Ellesandra felt comfortable hugging Star if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The magic slate did not absorb any magic. Rather, it responded to the natural magic that coursed through Ellesandra, reading it and forming what it was exposed to into some sort of signature that bound the magic of the gem to Ellesandra and Ellesandra alone. Not invasive in the slightest. Serenity did the same process, producing a card to hand to Ellesandra. Then, the small squeeze on Star's arm had her looking away from the knight, as if trying to hide her sorrow. The walls were...Mostly up. But they did struggle to maintain when Star was distressed, or any other strong emotion surged in her. And in the moment, the guilt, the shame, the sorrow were all prominent, and even without focusing on them specifically, Ellesandra touching Star would expose them to those same emotions.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took the card, but had frowned at the connection she felt from Star. Even with the barrier up as it was she'd felt that guilt and...shame? Was that Star recognizing how invasive it was, even if she couldn't control it? The sorrow was probably due to Ellesandras own reaction if she had to guess. Either way, she hated seeing Star shut down like that, and how she'd turned away from Ellesandra was unusual. Normally, Star wasn't ashamed to show her emotions. So, after receiving the library card and slipping it into a pocket in her pack, she stepped back and turned to look at Star. Her mouth opened, then closed. She didn't know what to do and say, and a public place didn't seem like the right moment to do this. After pursing her lips for a moment, she turned back to Amelia and Amara. "Perhaps you can point us in the right direction to start our research, and then show us a place we can stay today? I think we need to do some unwinding after the unfortunate fight earlier." Ellesandra placed a hand on her right ribs to help indicated where she'd been struck. Oh sure she'd been healed, but it was still sore and tender, as most of the healing had been focused on mending the bones in her arm and healing overall wasn't super effective on her to begin with. It wasn't a total lie, even if she was masking the real purpose.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara gently nodded to the words. "Aye. I ought to clean up," she said, earning a personal interjection from Serenity. "...Please do clean up before you go touching any materials, yes, Amara," said Serenity with a light tone. The relationship there was clearly positive. "Yes, yes, I won't go getting blood over your books, Serenity," responded Amara with a chuckle. "You mean won't go doing it...AGAIN...Right Amara?" responded the librarian, earning an amused roll of the eyes from Amara. "Like I said, I'll be sure to bleed more carefully," she said with another chuckle. She then looked towards Ellesandra. "I'll leave you in Amelia's care then. But I'd like to chat tonight, just the two of us, if you can find some time for me, Ellesandra." An open offer, one made with a smile, before Amara excused herself to go find a place to clean up. Amelia just had eyes shifting all around throughout, arms folded. "You can bunk for free in the guild hotel while you're here, since it'd just be a few days. That won't be a problem, right, Serenity?" asked Amelia, indicating that Serenity had some authority over her. Serenity gently shook her head. "Plenty of room. Doesn't take a genius to see they were helpful in a pinch, so better the rooms get used instead of collecting dust," said Serenity. Amelia nodded, then perked up. "Oh, as for research, uh, what was the home plane you're looking to research, Star?" asked Amelia, bringing Star out of her funk for a moment to reply, though even that was lacking her usual brightness. "Oh, uhm. Gurhal," came her response. Amelia wore a difficult expression at that, suggesting she'd never heard of it. Not that never having heard of one of the countless planes was too strange, but Amelia did consider herself well read enough to know about most of the large, civil ones. Serenity perked up as well, eyeing Star with curiosity. "Gurhal? We do have some material pertaining to that plane, yes. Though I admit, it's not as comprehensive as I'd like...I don't...I don't suppose you've any intention on bringing any allies with you?" With the understanding that Myst had a desire to collect knowledge, it seemed to present an opportunity for aide, in the interest of collecting knowledge from Gurhal.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The exchange between Amara and Serenity would normally have made Ellesandra smile. Her eyes flicked between them and the clearly teasing relationship they had, eyeing Amara and wondering just how often she got bloody and then went to the library, but her attention was pulled again over to Star, concern going through her. The thing was, she couldn't even just hold her tongue to avoid upsetting Star; she had to completely mask her emotion from her in situations like that, and Ellesandra wasn't even sure it was possible. She was drawn back into the main conversation when Amara spoke to her, inviting her to have a private chat that evening. Ellesandra tilted her head to the side, curious and...cautious. A glance was given to Star, then back to Amara. There was obvious hesitancy to leave Star in order to have a private conversation with Amara that evening. "I won't promise anything." Was the only response. She was open to chatting, but she wasn't going to commit to stepping away from her role long enough to have a personal conversation with Amara. At the confirmation of being able to bunk, she refocused on what they were doing and their goal, glancing at Star when she mentioned her home plane, then back at Serenity who seemed...interested in that option. And the option of having allies sent with them. When Star didn't immediately answer that question, Ellesandra stepped in. "Give us some time to consider our research and goals and have a conversation before we commit to allowing allies to be brought with us or not." This was entirely Star's decision, though Ellesandra would certainly encourage it if she'd be open to it. She knew that they'd have to fight Black Diamond in some form or fashion on the other side of the portal, considering that it was their group that had captured Aurora. It was way too optimistic to hope they could pull of a stealth rescue mission without getting into some form of a fight, especially considering how Ellesandra wasn't exactly a stealthy type. Not to mention, when was Ellesandra optimistic about a mission anymore?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"Of course, of course," said Serenity, realizing she had been rushing them. She raised her hands, aiming to placate any notion that she was pressuring them. "If you'd like to show them to their quarters then, Amelia, I can see that the relevant materials are fetched from the archives," she said, a flash of recognition on the librarian's face that the group needed some alone time. "Just have your cards ready if you'd like to take the materials out of Myst on loan. There are plenty of places to return the books otherwise, or you can give them to Capi." With that, Serenity deferred to Amelia, who put one hand on her hip and nudged her head in an animated way for the others to follower her back to the collection of half a dozen magic circles. There was one that was unlabeled, one that seemed to require a bit more than just stepping on the circle as Amelia briefly concentrated on her own magic to set the destination of the portal before it opened. And when stepping through this portal, the group was brought to the guild hall of the Followers of Myst. It was, like the rest of the athenaeum, expansive and proud in its construction. The symbol of the guild was hung on blue banners sporting white trim, depicting an open book emblazoned on a shield. Defenders of knowledge, or so seemed to be the implication. The main entrance to the hall was a general area, with tables set up for the gathering space, a staffed counter off to the right once progressing through the entry corridor, which had kegs of ale and some guild members dining on plates of food that smelled fairly nice. Nobody paid much attention to Star or Ellesandra, though Amelia seemed to turn a few heads. The furry-eared woman shot harsh glances around at a few choice people who saw fit to get clear out of their path of walking and strike a stance of respect in response. Amelia led the two through the main gathering hall, up a flight of steps, and through another corridor to find another corridor lined with doors. She walked along, looking at the name plates for each room. They followed a logical progression. G1. G3. G5. On the other side was G2. G4. G6. The nameplates glowed with soft gold, until Amelia found one - G17 - that was not glowing gold, but blue. She twisted the knob and pushed the door in, then motioned inwards for the other two. "All yours," she said, clearly allowing them in with the intent of departing soon after. "I'm in room FC3 if you need me. Down the hall there, just check the prefix of the doors, you'll find the FC rooms eventually." Assuming there was no further questions, the two were free to enter the room which had two beds, two writing desks, two dressers which had towels and a few pairs of evening wear that were vaguely small, medium, and large in size. Likely to not fit the best, but they were clean and cotton and clearly free to be used if desired. Once the two entered, the nameplate acquired a golden hue instead of its blue one. And Star was fine to go along with it all without a word, following whatever Ellesandra decided to do.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along with Amelia once it was all confirmed with Serenity they could come back later to get the necessary materials. She watched the way the portal was opened, trying to keep everything in mind in case they, for any odd reason, needed to open a portal of their own using one of these devices. As they entered the guildhall, she kept an eye out on the people around them, keeping close to Star just in case and walking along as they got to the apparent room that Amelia was leaving them in. A glance was given to it, just looking in briefly to confirm what was in there and ensuring there wasn't anyone else in the room. She stepped aside to let Star in, but even as she did she turned to look at Amelia before she could walk off. "Can you let me know how I can contact one of you, or travel via those...teleportation things if we decide to go out?" She wanted to have some autonomy, or the option of it, in this strange town. They had mentioned reaching out to that magical guide as a possibility, which would be a last resort for her honestly. Also, she assumed Amara would come find her later if she wanted to have that talk still, but either way. Ellesandra stood in the door way, letting Star head into the bedroom while waiting on an answer from Amelia.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Amelia paused for a moment, then reached into a pouch that was concealed by her frilly dress. She produced a small metal coin-like object. It was circular and seemed to be made of brass, hard to mix up with a gold piece in colour, let alone shape. Upon the coin was a pair of lips. "It's a Sending Stone. Or, rather, Sending Coin. I'm sure you're familiar, but in case you're not, you can use it to send a message to the paired coin, which I have on me. Twenty four words maximum per message. Goes both ways. Messages are telepathic, so you don't need to say anything out loud and look like a weirdo talking to yourself. As for the 'teleportation things'," she said with raised fingers to do mocking air quotes, clearly not one to miss out on a chance to be a brat about her magical aptitude. "They're teleportation circles. You just attune it to where you want to go, though that requires you...Know where you want to go with it. They interconnect all through the athenaeum, so you should at least be able to figure out how to get back to the library services office, or the main foyer with them. Else, just step on the circles that have a label that sounds like somewhere you want to go, and if you get lost just ask Capi what to do. It's what she's there for, you know."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took the coin, taking a moment to turn it over a few times in her hand to inspect it. A sending coin was neat, and that would be able to connect to Amelia. There was a pang of regret that it didn't go to Amara instead, since she felt like she'd get alone with Amara more than Amelia, but she didn't look a gift horse in the mouth or say anything about that. Amelia was being very kind to share this, as well as to show them around when needed. The air quotes caused her eyes to narrow at Amelia with no real malice or intent behind them, lips pursed, but nodding at the explanation. "Thank you." And always the obvious lack of being a social butterfly, Ellesandra stepped into the room and closed the door behind her after thanking Amelia, considering that conversation absolutely done. She was still holding the coin and looked down at it, before moving it in to place in a pocket as well, away from her coin purse in case she accidentally got them mixed up somehow when not paying attention. After doing so, she stepped in to lower the pack down in a corner and looked to Star. "So, what's going on?" Ellesandra starting the conversation was an olive branch, hopefully. There was obvious discomfort in doing so, knowing this might be an emotion filled conversation and that Star wasn't feeling well and being unsure how that was going to go. Would Star cry? Would she be angry at Ellesandra for her continued discomfort with her powers? Ellesandra was prepping herself for either, unsure how this would go at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amelia was left to stand in the hallway after having the door closed on her face. Well. How rude. But she didn't linger on it and walked off. Star had helped herself to sitting on her bed. The two beds were separated only by the distance of the nightstand between them, with a few inches of berth on either side. A fair bit closer than the hotel at Cloverport, but not the closest the two had been in terms of sleeping arrangements. Certainly more space than in the tent. Star was sitting, quiet, and pulled her legs up to her chest and hugged them. So when Ellesandra asked what was going on, she shrunk into herself a little more. "...W-What do you mean? I'm just...S-Sorry for making you uncomfortable, is all."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't consider it rude, having obviously been the end of the conversation, but either way. When she watched Star pull her legs up to her chest and hug them, Ellesandra moved to sit on the opposite bed, feet on the floor and elbows moving to rest on her knees. She leaned forward, hands clasped in front of her as Star shrunk into herself, lowering her head to try to meet Star's eyes. "Star, you're pulling a me. I don't know why, either. If that is what will work for you and what you need to do, far be it for me to stop you from withdrawing and closing in on yourself, but that's not normal for you, so I'm worried." Her words were serious, not teasing or poking fun of Star, or even degrading herself for how she handled emotions. She was frowning, watching Star closely. "Your powers make me uncomfortable Star, not you. And that's not something you have control over, and I'm working on getting over. You sharing what you saw made me uncomfortable because that's something I don't feel like I should have full access to knowing. If I were Amelia, I would feel bothered that you shared that with someone else, even if you knowing it is forgivable since you can't control it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "There's obviously so many things that I see that I don't share with you, or with anyone," she said, having shrunk even more tightly into herself as Ellesandra laid things out for her. Facing that she had done something to make Ellesandra uncomfortable wasn't the primary concern; she had done so before and could do so as many times as she needed to, owning her mistakes as they came. "But I saw how her attitude made you angry. How you didn't see it was just a face she wears. I didn't want you two to be at odds." She also felt like she would have been able to intuit the same information without her powers, but she couldn't know that and didn't want to seem arrogant. Maybe her powers did make all the difference in this instance. She didn't know. "But like I said...I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore. I'll be normal. I don't want you to be uncomfortable around me. I'm sorry." The repeated apologies, the fearful tone in her voice, the tears that were pooling in the corner of her eyes...This all certainly was contributing to her state, but it certainly seemed by this abnormal withdrawal that there was more to it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Angry? She frowned, not having realized she'd felt angry at Amelia. Star wasn't wrong, she'd felt defensive and angry and irritated at Amelia poking at their lack of magical intelligence - specifically at Ellesandra's lack of it. There were reasons for that, which she very much ignored and pretended didn't exist, just like everything emotional since the incident. She scratched at the back of her head while watching Star come close to breaking down. The tears pooling in her eyes was unfortunately becoming a normal sight, but the fear in her voice was very much not. And it stirred something in Ellesandra. The protectiveness, the anger at herself for doing something that brought Star to that point. Previously when Ellesandra had reached out to hold Star, it had been...obligatory, in a way. A 'I know this will help you, and I want you to stop crying, so here.' This time, though, there was a desire to wrap Star in her arms and protect her from the world, from herself. A desire to make that fear go away, whatever was causing it. There was a moment of hesitation before Ellesandra moved, her own disinterest in being close to someone coming up, but after just a second of that she moved to sit next to Star and then turned fully to her to embrace her. No small side hug, gentle touches to let Star get the physical comfort. Ellesandra fully turned and wrapped her arms around Star from the side, pulling her into her armored chest and tilting her head to the side so that Star's head could rest in the crook of her neck. "Star." She whispered, assuming Star allowed the embrace. "It. Is. Okay. Okay?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Physical comfort was important to Star. Even when it had been obligatory, there was a strong comfort that came with being held, and being able to hold Ellesandra in turn. So a genuine hug, even if it was against armor, was a powerful thing. Star wasn't someone who closed off, not someone who shut herself away from others. And though she had learned to try her best to prevent her emotions from bleeding into Ellesandra's aura, it had always required focus. Focus she didn't have while her heart was in turmoil. So the floodgates were open, and when Ellesandra held her, the emotions that Star felt blossomed into the periphery of Ellesandra's mind. Not felt as their own, but able to feel them and understand them all the same. There was fear, but it would take specific focus to understand the purpose, the source of the fear. For the moment, it was scattered and aimless. There was also loneliness, though Ellesandra's hug was chipping away at that. Still...It would be easy to wonder why she felt lonely when they had been traveling together, when they had even been in a group and laughing earlier. The sorrow, which was obvious, and connected to all the other dark feelings. Shame...There certainly was shame, self directed and inwardly focused. Shame about herself. Shame that had only seemed to grow stronger in each of these glimpses into Star's heart over the time Ellesandra had known her. There was also...longing. Vague and formless, it spurred an ache in he heart to focus on it, even if its purpose or foundation was a mystery. The longing and loneliness tied together to form into a deep vulnerability. A sensitive heart that signaled to Ellesandra that one wrong word could break Star's heart in the moment. There was also a similarly formless...Anger? It didn't seem to mesh with the other emotions. It was just there, floating around in her, wound up in a ball of frustration and...Jealousy? Star certainly did know how to deal with her emotions better than most, but that didn't mean she was immune to the uglier feelings the human heart was prone to feel. Though it would take another like Star to decipher these emotions with this mystic connection alone. All there was to do for someone who didn't have that gift was either to focus on them intently to try and understand, to ignore them completely, or to talk, and ask. At the very least, the sweet words of being told it was okay were...Mildly helpful. Combined with the hold which she of course didn't resist in the slightest, there was clear comfort reaching her, even if it wasn't enough to fix whatever was wrong.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Like the previous times when she'd touched Star and the barrier had been down, Ellesandra strongly focused on NOT focusing on these emotions. She could feel and sense they were there, but Ellesandra respected that privacy and boundary way too much to try to delve into them or acknowledge that they were there. It would be incredibly hypocritical if she decided to go into them, even if Star would probably be okay with it. As Star fell into the embrace, Ellesandra squeezed lightly at Star's side, and then pulled away for a moment. Her arms were still around Star, but she wasn't actively pulling her close anymore. "Star. I can't help you if you don't tell me what's bothering you. I'm okay just holding you if you prefer that, but as much as I'm not a talker, I know you are." She watched Star, then either way moved to stand. She didn't walk away from Star though, simply began the process of removing her armor. Either way, if Star talked or not, removing the armor would make the physical comfort. Ellesandra couldn't imagine snuggling your face up against a cold steel plate would be particularly comforting, after all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly was. She talked a lot, expressed herself a lot, both physically and verbally. So it remained a departure from her normal self to be so quiet. She didn't stop them from pulling away, but whether Ellesandra felt it or not there was a lingering connection for a second or two as Ellesandra pulled away that let them feel how Star felt about it. Her heart crunched and even if she logically could tell Ellesandra was just getting out of their armor, the vulnerable woman's heart was crying out to Ellesandra: 'Please don't go'. Star just pulled her legs against her chest more fully, relying on herself for comfort while she waited for the knight beside her to change. The dented portion of Ellesandra's right arm armor might give them a bit of trouble, and would need to be repaired before they left again. Which said nothing about their actual arm underneath. Healed, yes, but the soreness was unlikely to play nice with the deeper, lasting injury. "...Why is it you accepted this duty of guarding me?" she asked, her voice mousy. "You mentioned something about it being because...That person in your dreams told you not to. Was it just...To spite them, or something?" Of course, Star was likely way off, but the other emotions in her heart were leading to dangerous assumptions and conclusions. Things that were quietly sitting in her heart and torturing her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra winced at the feel of pain at Ellesandra pulling away. A glance was given to Star, but then she just continued removing her armor. Her right arm and armor was definitely injured still and dented, but Ellesandra didn't bother trying to remove the gauntlet on her right arm right now. It was dented and would require some time to work off, which was very much not a priority. What she did do was get the plate removed and her left gauntlet, as well as her armored skirt so that she was down to her leggings and basic cloth jerkin that was tucked into said leggings. Moving back over to the bed, she didn't answer until she had sat back down next to Star. "Not to spite them." There was a hesitation at how much to share here. It was hard to share the real reason without giving a lot of information about her past. But, really, Star already knew some of it. So taking a deep breath, she reached back out to pull Star back in again, pulling them so that Star could choose to either just hug close into Ellesandra, or go down into a full on cuddle. Ellesandra would leave that up to Star, focused on not focusing on her emotions while trying to get rid of that fear and insecurity. "I won't let someone die if I can protect them." She said, finally. It wasn't the full truth, but it hinted at it. "It was my belief that leaving you alone, something would happen to you. And that would be on me, for knowingly walking away when I had been warned that you'd be attacked if you continued your journey. I...won't let someone die when I have the opportunity to stop it." Not again. It may not have been Star dying FOR her, but she still refused to just let Star die because she didn't travel with her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  If Star was given the option of a close physical position with someone she was close with, she was going to take that. It took little to earn her desire to hug. Though, to earn the closeness that Ellesandra had in her heart took much more. But it had been earned, and it meant that Star would, as much as allowed, cuddle up with Ellesandra. The answer was met with a little silence as she processed it, and what it meant. It was something that already happened, she knew that much. She also knew that pressing Ellesandra was likely to upset them, and she didn't want to do that. But it also wasn't sure it was the answer she wanted. The negative storm of emotions was still there after all. Still...It was noble. And that was comforting. Part of her wanted to tell Ellesandra they weren't obligated to walk this path with her. But she knew that Ellesandra knew that - they had been ambiguous enough about their desire to stay in the first place enough to make that clear. This all evolved from a simple escort back to the city, now ballooned into so much more. An angry flare rose in her heart, a spiteful desire to stubbornly rub the lack of obligation in Ellesandra's face in the way her heart, in the moment, felt Ellesandra constantly did to her when it came to her powers and everything surrounding them. But then that anger died, squashed by a wave of emotion that was more core to Star: Care. Kindness. Gentleness. And when the anger died, it left a wake of shame and apologetic grief. She hadn't even said anything to Ellesandra, yet she still felt the guilt as if she had. "It...Wouldn't be on you. I've known since the day it happened that I might meet my peril. I...Don't want to. I really don't. And it's been so comforting to have you here to help me through this." She paused, considering her words carefully. "I'm...Growing into a different person with you. I've always placed the wellbeing of others above myself, I'm...Sure you've noticed. But that's been largely because I never had someone I felt I could rely on like I can you. So it's been...Confusing, and scary when I sit with some of these emotions I feel. And some of the things you've said have struck me deeply in my heart. Made me...Worried that you'll one day soon decide you dislike me so much that you'll cease caring about what happens to me. So whenever I look at you and see...Annoyance, or discomfort, or disapproval, I just get...Scared..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pulled down onto the bed and let Star nestle into her. Her hold was tight enough that Star would feel the pressure, just enough she'd remember that she was being held close and was safe, but not so tight as to cause any discomfort. She was also careful not to make her hold too loose, to make Star think she wanted to get away or didn't want to be here. There was a bit of a spark in the center of her chest, her own desire for this type of closeness that was coming up at her actively offering it to Star. The memory of how she'd woken that morning, curled up against Star, and how much she had wanted to curl up against star consciously - though she wanted to not want that and didn't admit it to herself at all. As Star spoke, she looked up at the ceiling and let out a slow, deep breath that bordered on a sigh. The bad thing about encouraging Star to talk about these things, was that it necessitated a response from Ellesandra. She was slow in providing one, taking time to process and think, to weigh her words and try to identify which ones would be the honest truth phrased in a way that would be the most reassuring and comforting. This didn't come natural, so it took some time to consider, the entire time her hand had begun idly rubbing up and down Star's back gently. "Star, my desire to protect you isn't...isn't just because I feel like I would be responsible if I walked away and you died. Which is true, I would feel that way, but I know you'd argue that." There was hesitation. A rawness rose in her at the words that caught in her throat, the grief bubbled up. It was pushed back down, adamant that this conversation and emotional hold wouldn't somehow turn back around to focus on Ellesandra instead, but that didn't stop the words she spoke next from coming out in a choked whisper. "I walked away before. I let my charge do what she thought best. Stubborn like you, to do it with or without me. I thought me walking away would make her think twice, to not do it." She swallowed, more like a gulp as it pushed past a knot in her throat. "I wouldn't do that again, Star. If me being with you will protect you in this journey, then I'm with you." There was more. There was always more, but not only did Ellesandra not feel comfortable sharing or talking about it, actively not wanting to do so and wanting to keep all of that shoved down, but she also wanted to ensure this focused on reassuring Star. Not on Star turning around and reassuring Ellesandra, who would 100% break down after the shit today already if she went that route. "I won't leave you because you annoy me, Star. You're a good person." This was emphasized with a light squeeze, even if said squeeze resulted in a flinch at the raw and sore arm and rib. "I'll call you out on it when I think you overshare with your power, but that's what companions do, right? Make eachother better by letting the other know when they mess up. And I get why you do. It's...natural to you, to see that. It doesn't seem like an invasion, I'm sure. And to some it might not be."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star listened, quiet and fighting back the tears. Truly, with this comforting cuddle, it was easy enough to fight back those worries, those woes. All the rising negativity was intercepted before it could boil over in her heart. Calm found her, rather than tears. A profound effect that Ellesandra was coming to have on Star. A closeness that grew each day. Star envisioned herself in the situation Ellesandra described, and though she wouldn't say it, as she could tell it was a touchy subject, she couldn't disagree. Yes, she would do the same thing. Ellesandra threatening to walk away wouldn't stop her from doing something she thought was important. It wouldn't stop her from finding her mother. So she just gently nodded to those words. There was a pang of sorrow in her heart at being told she annoyed Ellesandra. Perhaps it was meant as a hypothetical future annoyance, but in the moment her vulnerable heart took it as belief that she presently annoyed Ellesandra, and it was enough to make her tremble lightly in the tight hold that was given. Another nod followed. Some it was an invasion upon was certainly Ellesandra, once more reminding her how much it bothered them. It wasn't said, which lessened the blow, but Ellesandra had never been shy about implications. The blunt 'the latter' rang in her mind. She remained quiet for a moment after all that. "My mother always told me to see my gift as a beautiful thing but...Sometimes I can't help but feel like it's a curse instead." 'Sometimes' being whenever she saw that rejection from Ellesandra, naturally.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet again after Star called her magic a curse. Or well, implied it felt like that sometimes. There were mixed emotions there, some of her wanting to agree and another part of her wanting to tell Star she was wrong. If Ellesandra had that power, she would hate it. She might even go so far as to walk around blindfolded or with her eyes closed, in completely transparent honesty. Then again, if she had that power, maybe she would be more comfortable with emotions than she was now, and so that idea of how she'd feel was biased and incorrect. Either way, she took a deep breath and looked down at Star. It was odd, holding Star this way that Ellesandra was looking down on her; she wasn't used to looking down on anyone with her short height. "Star, I don't know that curse is right for you. Your magic...fits you." She paused, then looked back up. There was frustration with herself, at not being able to easily find the right words to express her thoughts. She always spoke more with actions than words, but there weren't really actions right now that would explain this. "It's like mine. My body rejects arcane and divine magic. I'm not sure why it doesn't effect other magic, like your auramancy or my own physical based magic, but it refuses it either way. The most I've been able to get is instead of refusing it, to be able to absorb it - which is a great skill to have, but not exactly helpful when I need divine or arcane healing." There was a pause as she tried to refocus on what she was trying to say, lips pushing to the side in thought. One hand pulled away from Star lightly to pull her ponytail out, it being uncomfortable laying like this, and letting her hair fall down her back naturally instead. The hand was quickly returned to wrapping around Star, careful to not truly let go of her entirely. "I'm guarded. I don't let things in. I've always been that way, even as a child. My magic fit the way I approach life. Yours fits the way you do, too. While I'm guarded and don't let things in, you're the exact opposite. You let EVERYTHING in. And you embrace it all, and others. You can use your power for extraordinary things; even if I didn't believe that myself, I was all but told that but two different deity-like beings on opposite sides of their own little war. It has a bad side effect that you can't control, but that doesn't really make it a curse to you. Or you a bad person for having it, either." It would still be a curse if Ellesandra was the one who possessed the power, but that had already been covered.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took time to digest Ellesandra's words. Magic being a reflection of self was something that was particularly true for her and her family. By nature of how she could see emotion, she had become a more emotionally in-tune person. She was naturally empathetic, as well as magically. It had fostered in her a love of all life, of all living things. Even without her mother raising her on a diet that was largely vegetarian, she would have come to that result regardless just by the consequence of her magic; likely it was true of all of her family, eating meat as a necessity rather than indulgence. It made her an affectionate person. A trusting person, unless she saw reason not to be. For when she could simply see if someone was hiding something, even if she didn't know what, it was easy to trust. It was easy to be a judge of character, when one's character was plainly on display for her. How she couldn't be bothered by an attitude like Amelia's because she could see how the anxieties bubbled just beneath that defensive posture, how she could piece together that it was likely Amelia grew up with harsh expectations and less than kind social circles that hardened her despite the clear desire to be recognized and acknowledged burning so brightly. Just as it gave her so many boons, however, it came with its own drawbacks. Her capacity for strictly offensive magics had always been troublesome. She could manage minor effects on this front, but her magic naturally attuned to supporting others. It was only in times where someone she cared about was in peril that she felt the swell of magic that could be used for direct harm burn inside her. Ellesandra's words had her pensive about all this, and ultimately coming to the conclusion that had her nodding gently against the other woman. "I want to do extraordinary things," she said gently. "I want to save others from tragedy. I want to mend wounds that others cannot. I want to bring smiles to everyone I meet," she said, then pulled her head out from under Ellesandra's chin to look them in the eyes. A look that specifically focused those words just spoken unto Ellesandra directly. She wanted to make THEM smile. "It hurts...When I falter. My heart cannot bear being a source of pain in others. Least of all those closest to me..." Her lips trembled, here. A bubbling of something she was internally warring with herself about. But ultimately, she said it: "Least of all...You."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra held Star, letting her take all the time she needed. Her hand continued to rub up and down on star's back lightly, reassuringly, comforting. When Star nodded against her, she turned her eyes down from where they had been focused - or really, intentionally unfocused gazing without seeing anything above to intentionally avoid looking too closely at the emotions she felt and saw within Star when they touched - to look at her again. The words - 'I want to do extraordinary things' hit her with a bitter sweet memory, one of her as a child saying the exact same things to Sia. The child-like innocence and naivety, that she alone would be able to save the world, save multiple people, make literally everyone she met have a better life because of it. Yet as Star continued, her eyes dipped to those lips, trembling. Star, if she was paying attention, would see a flash of a desire, one which was quickly stamped out and refocused on the situation. Even if she might be attracted to Star, Ellesandra wouldn't let desire like that fester. She might want to comfort with a kiss, but that was not right for their relationship - friendship or just client-charge relationship. Ellesandra was not emotionally available, and Star wouldn't be happy with anything less, Ellesandra guessed. So, she focused on what Star was saying instead. "You can't go through life without hurting people, Star. Maybe without hurting them intentionally, but unintentionally? The only way I can imagine doing that is if you just don't interact with anyone for the rest of your life." Ellesandra was choosing words carefully, trying to gauge how to say things. Her mind went back to when she'd said similar words to Sia, and an idea popped into her mind. She hesitated, caution and a bit of uncertainty creeping up before she looked down to Star. "May I share a...memory with you?" Ellesandra was afraid of saying things wrong, of making Star upset, but she trusted her mentor to have said them better. While she was bad at words, wasn't a leader or inspiring or able to scold someone for being naive without it coming off harsh, Sia was able to.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile at the notion of not being able to hurt people unintentionally unless she just became an antisocial hermit. She wouldn't be able to bear such a life. She needed to be around people. She also saw the brief moment of desire. Something that evoked a blush. Even as it was pushed down, there was a spark that flashed in her own heart, in her chest. She didn't draw attention to it, but she still wore her heart on her sleeve, so Ellesandra would be able to see the way that desire was reciprocated. The two were close, cuddling, with mutual attraction simmering just below the surface. She was feeling vulnerable. But she took Ellesandra's lead; they pushed it down, and she...Didn't push it down, but she did allow those butterflies to live in her heart, flutter, then settle. Now wasn't the time, but she still allowed herself to feel it, as with all her feelings. The offer to have a memory shared evoked a slightly eager nod. "O-Of course, Ellesandra. Always. You don't even need to ask...Even if I know you will," she said with a smile. There was nothing at all wrong with asking, and Star certainly would as well. But she needed to say it so strongly, for she needed to make it clear that she would never, ever, ever deny Ellesandra if they wanted to be open with her about anything. "Just...Open yourself to me and focus on the memory. My heart will listen to whatever you wish to share."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra saw the blush, but she still wasn't letting herself focus too much on the emotions that she felt from Star, so the actual desire wasn't noticed. It was guessed at, considering the blush, but again that knowledge was ignored instead of focused on - though this being because she didn't want to entertain the idea of indulging in that desire, rather than respect for Star's privacy. When given the confirmation that she could share a memory, Ellesandra closed her eyes and did her best to try to 'open herself' to Star. This wasn't easy; even if Star could see right past her normal guards and walls, they still existed. Removing them wasn't something Ellesandra had any practice in, and the idea of opening herself to Star to let her see the memory was...scary. There was fear, trepidation circling within her as she tried, trying to be careful and cautious not to share more than exactly what she was intending to share. It took a few minutes for her to be able to open herself up enough to push the memory through their auras and their bond. When she did, Star would find herself watching a much younger Ellesandra in mid-spar with who could only be Sia. Ellesandra looked to be in her preteens, about 11 or 12. She was already at her full height of 5'1, having hit her growth spurt early an then just...never hitting another one. Yet, her body was still that of a child, not grown. She didn't have the wider shoulders, she had less muscle, and her form was more wirey than it was strong. Her hair wasn't nearly as long - and in fact looked like it had recently been cut in a way that mirrored Sia's in front of her, though it had been growing out a bit. The left side had obviously been cut extremely short while the rest had been left at a bit longer of a length, to match Sia's sidebuzz and short hair, but Ellesandra had been growing it back out. It made for an uneven grow out, but once the left side was long enough to be decent she'd cut the rest of her hair to match even with it again. They were in the center of an obvious training ground, though right now the only people actively using it were Ellesandra and Sia. There was a castle in the backround, the ground situated far enough away the sound of training wouldn't disturb those within it but a few minute walk and still within the walls of the castle. There were people far off on the other side using targets to practice archery, and the tell tale sign of servants walking around going about their tasks. Ellesandra was in leather training pads, with a dull training longsword in her right hand and a wooden buckler in her left. Sia across from her was using matching weapons, towering over Ellesandra at a height of 6'1, and looked to be in her mid to late thirties at this point. During this memory, her own hair was all black, unlike the salt and pepper it had been in Ellesandra's dream from when Ellesandra was older. Her face was hard, and it didn't take an expert to see that she was pushing Ellesandra, easily deflecting blows and striking back. It was a punishment bout, for Ellesandra being late to training. A reminder just how much better Sia was than Ellesandra, and why she needed to focus on her training. Sia was using a similarly dull weapon, but that didn't stop it from bruising and hurting each time it struck Ellesandra's arm or ribs - yet it was always held back from doing real damage. Sia would never hit hard enough to break bone, to cause any real harm or damage, but just hard enough to hurt and remind Ellesandra her guard had been down. Ellesandra, despite this being a punishment bout and already covered in bruises, was having fun. There was joy all in her emotions, more than Star ever would have seen in real time Ellesandra. Sparring like these, even if it hurt, was exhilarating. There was some frustration at how much she kept getting hit, the mistakes she was making, but there was also appreciation for them being shown, and a determination not to make them again. The memory also started near the end of the fight, and Ellesandra had already been winded and tired, working to control her breathing but obviously being pushed to her limits. It wasn't until she faltered on a step forward, her leg giving beneath her from the exhaustion of the fight that Sia pulled up to stop them. Ellesandra kneeled in front of her, hands splayed out on the ground and breathing heavily while trying to recover, and Sia looking down at her with a stoic face that was very reminiscent of how Ellesandra wore her face most of the time now. "Up, El. You lasted ten minutes this time, that's an improvement from last week." Ellesandra struggled back up, muscles still obviously exhausted and still breathing heavily to recover from the exertion. Her legs shook and her head hung low, but not because of shame - just relaxing and letting her neck muscles rest. "Th...thank..you...ma'am." She said between deep breaths. She winced as she raised her arm, bruising on her upper arm making itself known from one of Sia's blows to it. "I'll send word to the servants to have a cold bath prepared for you tonight to help with the blows." Sia was stoic, but Star would be able to see that there was affection in her emotions. And disappointment at Ellesandra having been late. Sia may have never said it to Ellesandra, and Ellesandra was too bad with people to tell, but Sia had considered Ellesandra like a daughter - even when she was this young. "Thank...thank you, Ma'am." Ellesandra repeated, looking over at one of the stumps aligned along the outside of the training circle and moving to sit on it for a moment, giving her legs a rest. They would need it, after that bout. Sia followed, sitting beside Ellesandra. "You know better than to be late to training, El. What was so important that held you up? It's not like you." Ellesandra let out a huff and a smirk, feeling a bit sheepish but not ashamed at all for being late this time. "Carrie...the - the young bakers girl...you know them?" Sia nodded, frowning. "Carrie made you late?" Ellesandra shook her head quickly, still working to speak through the heavy breathing. "No No - I chose to be late, wasn't...wasn't her fault. She had climbed up the...the big tree next to the castle, you know the -" Ellesandra didn't finish that, just pointed in the direction of the castle, towards the right side. Sia nodded. "She was scared to get down. I went up...helped her down." There was a mixture of pride and disappointment in Sia now, though the only thing that shown through was a frown. "You chose to do something that you could have easily asked a number of the servants to do, that would make you late to your training?" Ellesandra nodded, still sheepish. "She...she knows me, Ma'am. Less likely for her to....to panic and fall than some...some servant helping her. She's only...five...that might really...hurt for her." Sia pursed her lips, again much of the same way Star would have seen Ellesandra do so. "You know you can't help everyone yourself, Ellesandra." Ellesandra shook her head, looking up finally to meet Sia's eyes and giving her a cocky smirk. "I'm going to...to do extraordinary things, ma'am. I'll...I'll save the Kingdom. I don't....don't care if it's an ancient dragon attacking, it will fall at my sword...ma'am." The youthful innocence, combined with arrogance. For an eleven year old, Ellesandra truly was skilled, but her dreams were still that of a child. Imagining herself on the walls, fighting off a dragon and single handedly saving the world. Sia pursed her lips, shaking her head. "No, Ellesandra. That's foolish. If you spend your life trying to save and help everyone, you'll never be able to do so. You have limits, and it is important that you recognize them, or you'll find yourself in an early, foolish grave." Ellesandra shook her head. "But I have...have to try, Ma'am! If I don't, then if something bad...bad happens to them, it's my fault!" Sia leaned down, getting to eye level with Ellesandra. "No, it is not. You always give what you can, I'm not saying walk away, but it is impossible to please or help everyone. Trying to do so is only going to cause you to hurt others instead. If you can't give yourself fully to a cause, you won't be able to complete it and that will make it less effective, waste time. You can't help people out on both sides of the conflict and come away the victor for either side. You will fail at helping people. People will die under your watch Ellesandra, no matter how good a guard you are." Young Ellesandra seemed taken aback by how serious and insistent Sia was. She blinked, frowning and shaking her head. "No, Ma'am I - I can-" "No, you can't Ellesandra. You will burn yourself out trying. It is good that you helped Carrie, but you will need to learn to balance your priorities better going forward. Stopping to help someone may very well mean your initial mission is failed. You must be prepared for those types of consequences in the real world. And no matter how hard you try, you will upset people sometimes. It's the way of life, so learn how to deal with upsetting them instead of pretending you didn't." Ellesandra looked...dismayed, and upset by what Sia was saying. She didn't like having those dreams entirely shot down, still holding onto the belief that she could make a difference if she tried. That the others who couldn't, just didn't try hard enough or weren't good enough. She was distracted, however, from a young girl's voice calling from the background. A soft, singsong voice that immediately elicited a blush from the young Ellesandra. "Ellie! Are you done yet? Aunt Sia tell me you didn't wear her out again?!" Before the memory could actually move to where the voice was, though, Ellesandra ended it. Her guards snapped back into place and she looked away from Star, up into the ceiling of the room. It wasn't hard to tell though - the voice at the end had stirred up the grief and guilt that totally wasn't there in her. Enough that Ellesandra was clenching her jaw hard to help fight it back.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star helped guide Ellesandra through the process. It wasn't a simple thing to open one's self; it was akin to flexing a muscle on a limb that almost everyone had no idea they even had. As with magic, most didn't grasp it until the intrinsic feeling was shown to them, either by a mentor or by some event that triggered it. Ellesandra would find their grasp of their own aura weak and loose, as if reaching up at the moon to try and palm it. It was miles away. But with Star there, her influence created a bridge that allowed Ellesandra to step across the seemingly infinite void with ease and reach into themselves to produce the desired memory. Guiding the memory was as simple as remembering it, something that proved easily done when focusing on the emotions that triggered the memory. The affection for Sia, the source of the point trying to be conveyed, whatever it was that spoke to Ellesandra was the fuel that allowed the memory to burn brightly in their aura and be felt and relived. Star felt the physical pain in herself; transitive and temporary, it was simply part of the memory to her. She knew it was not her own pain, and was not actually hurt by it. But the ragged breaths, the soreness in Ellesandra, was all part of reliving the memory. As well, feeling the maternal emotions Sia had for Ellesandra was comforting, even if the woman was a rugged and at times, clearly, harsh mentor. It explained a lot about Ellesandra to Star. From the mannerisms she saw mirrored, to the no-nonsense attitude and harsh realities that guided them. It also explained why Ellesandra had been so stern with Star initially. Ellesandra saw a naiive spirit in Star, a woman who acted more on whimsy and idealism than thoughtful planning and strategy. The truth was that Star was a mix of both, a woman who Sia would absolutely come down upon like a ton of bricks if they were her mentor, but not a woman without her own talents either. Before meeting Ellesandra, Star was more liberal with taking risks. She thought on her feet, and that combined with her powers made her capable of navigating perilous situations. She was an intelligent woman. But there was a grain of wisdom to this chosen memory being shown to Star, for it was true. She couldn't help everyone. She regularly pushed herself to her limits, sometimes beyond them. But to Star, the answer was not to accept her limitations. The answer was to transcend them. Become stronger, so she could do more. Yet even in that truth that was core to Star, there was truth in that if Star did not focus, if she gave everything she had to everyone else, she would have nothing left to achieve her goal. To save her mother, when life had already taken her other mother away from her permanently. She could stop it from happening again, she did truly believe. But not if she stopped to help everyone stuck in a tree and let those distractions keep her from her goal. That was the message she interpreted from Ellesandra, through this memory of Sia. It was a truth she already acknowledged before this moment, but this memory helped to cement it. Even with that, however...Star had seen how powerful her own mother was. The same blood, the same magic, coursed through her veins. Temperance of herself was still necessary. She still needed to ensure she did not burn herself out. She had to accept that pursuing her goal was more important than some things. She still would have done what she did for Lissana a thousand times over, but it refocused her on a singular test: Is whatever she was trying to do worth her mother's life? Because truly, it might be a decision she would have to make. A thoughtful, contemplative energy suffused Star as the memory faded. A lot of things to digest, and an instinct for her to speak all about how much Sia's adoration warmed her heart...But that instinct was quashed. If Ellesandra was uncomfortable with Star sharing emotions that Amelia felt, she might very well consider sharing Sia's emotions a slap in the face. That, combined with the ending of the memory...Ellesandra certainly didn't seem to intend on that part being included, but the guilt, the grief, it was emotion that Star was able to link to, of all things, the handkerchief Ellesandra carried. The voice, the emotion, the confession that Ellesandra had let someone die and the specific word choice by Sia about Ellesandra being a guard...It clicked a few things into place. But Star didn't wish to come out of the gate with that. First, and foremost, she opened her eyes again after having closed them while embracing that memory and looked at Ellesandra deep in their eyes, waiting for their grief and guilt to subside if needed for them to look back and see her smiling. "...Thank you, Ellesandra. For sharing that. I...Need you to know that that means a lot to me. I don't take such things lightly, ever, but...It's particularly meaningful coming from you. You said yourself how guarded you are so...That trust means a great deal to me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took her time, forcing down those emotions again. She was silently thankful that Star gave her that time, knowing Star probably wanted her to talk about it, ask who that voice was, or encourage Ellesandra to share what happened. It was also good that Star hadnt mentioned what she had seen in Sia; that would have caused Ellesandra to entirely retreat. After practicing some deep breaths, she looked back down to see Star just...smiling at her. Then thanking her. She was a bit uncomfortable with the thanks, shrugging it off. "She said it better than I can. You can't...just never upset someone, Star. I'm sure you'll upset me again before this journey is through, knowing how prickly I can be." She paused, then shrugged again. "Control what you can, accept and handle what you can't. Make it better when it happens, that's all you can do."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a warm smile at the response and shook her head. She then moved a hand up to extend just an index finger and place it gently on the tip of Ellesandra's nose. "Not for that, silly," she said, voice gentle and quiet. "That, too, yes, but...I mean for sharing with me, for being open with me. And I...I know what you say is true," she said, retreating her hand again to rest on Ellesandra's shoulder. "I'm not saying I'm not going to upset you. I'm just saying...When it happens, I'm going to feel bad. I think it's...Important. Remorse is important. I'd never upset you intentionally, and if I wasn't upset by unintentionally doing so, then, well...It would mean I didn't really care that you were upset, or I didn't believe you were right to be upset, or...Something. The pit in my heart that twists and aches when I see the pain in you it's...Hard to bear. But I would rather feel it, than not. And it's important to me that when it happens, more than just make it better however I can, you know how it affects me. Not just assumed, not just...Said. Seen. You can't see my emotions unless you touch me and focus on what I feel, or when we touch and it just...Spills over and gets messy and..." She shook her head, she was getting off track. "The point is, Ellesandra...I can know in my head that my mistakes are mistakes, but I can't let myself be absolved of the pain, the remorse, of them just because it's inevitable. I cannot be so jaded or cynical. Those feelings...I've felt them before, of course. But among all the feelings I've ever had, those ones...The ones that push me towards indifference or minimizing how others feel...They make me feel the most disgusted with myself. So just...If you see me sad because I see that I've made you feel bad in some way, just understand that it's my way of trying to be better. I know I can't never upset people...But I can make sure every time it does that it's seen, more than just passively understood, that I didn't mean it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She again shrugged off the implied thanks. It made her uncomfortable, thinking about it or being the focus of appreciation, so she ignored that and focused on what else Star was sharing. The idea of feeling remorse was obviously not new to Ellesandra, but the difference between the two is Star felt things so strongly. Ellesandra felt remorse for things in the past, guilt for hurting Star or saying something that upset her, but there was a difference between letting it effect you as much as Star did, and just feeling that and trying to learn from it going forward. In a way, it was an action versus words situation. "Just because you feel remorse now doesn't mean you'll actually avoid doing the thing again in the future. The best way to make it up is to fix or avoid doing it again, showing remorse is just..." She shrugged. This was just Ellesandra's opinion though, very action oriented. Things didn't matter unless you backed them up with action. Just because you said you were sorry or actually felt, didn't mean you'd take the effort to make it better or prevent it. It was a moment before she added - "That's for me, at least. I'm aware that others are appeased by such shows, so I guess I can't blame you for expressing it as you do." She leaned her head back onto the bed, closing her eyes. The hand that had been rubbing Star's back moved up and lightly began petting through her long hair, a gesture that was entirely unconscious and not realized that she was even doing. Just a soothing, comforting, almost cuddling like gesture, more than just making Star feel better.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly appreciated the hand through her hair. It evoked the faintest blush, but she didn't fight it or even draw attention to it otherwise. "There's a difference between remorse and just...Aimless guilt. When you feel genuine remorse for something, it is a driver of change. It's why I can tell you that there are things even just from the moment I saw the discomfort in you at what I shared earlier today and now that I wanted to share but...Didn't. And won't. It's why I've eased back when it comes time to fight, instead of trying to get involved...Because I know how deeply the fear in you runs that something would happen to me, something you'd feel was your fault. I can't promise that danger will always elude me but...I can remember the pain I saw in you when you admitted what happened and why it hurts you so, and I can remember the remorse I felt in having let my own angers and frustrations blind me to what you felt until the emotion boiled over in you. Remorse without genuine change isn't meaningful, I'm sure you agree. It's not about appeasing anyone though. It's about honesty, to me. To me if...Someone hurt me, but didn't feel any remorse for it, well...It just signals to me that they weren't affected by the weight of their actions, if that makes sense." She paused here, gently shaking her head as she felt herself going off track again, and pushed a little closer to Ellesandra, happy as could be to bask in the warm, affectionate gestures as she tucked her head under their chin again. "What I'm saying is it's...My way of telling you I'm sorry, and that I'm going to be better. And I will be. Even if I'm not perfect, I feel I've already come a long way to better understanding you. And that's important to me. You're important to me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet, eyes closed while running her fingers mindlessly through Star's hair, listening. The reminder of that night she'd broken down caused discomfort and a pre-emptive barrier between herself and that nonexistent mountain, not wanting a repeat of that night. The explanation made sense, as to why Star had stayed back and not done much against the armored knight - though causing it to slip before it could impale Ellesandra certainly wasn't nothing. She shook her head finally, speaking. "First, I don't want you to just...not participate in a fight, if it's needed. I just want you to prioritize your safety. Don't do something foolish like rush into a physical fight or step in front of a blow for me. Stay back and use defensive magic, if you participate. That or get yourself out of there. Just standing to the sideline doing nothing is....well, I guess it's not productive." A soft shrug, and that's when she seemed to realize where her hand was. It froze, stopping the petting, and then slowly lowered back down to Star's back. There was a mixture of shame, desire, and guilt in response to the realization. Shame at potentially taking advantage of the closeness for her own need of touch, desire for - well, obvious reasons - and guilt that she might be unintentionally leading Star on. She took a deep breath, refocusing herself on the topic. "And it's not me you have to apologize to, in that situation. Your magic makes me uncomfortable not because of the information you share with me, but it's lack of consent from the other person, Star. If someone consents for you to analyze and share the emotions they have in their aura that's one thing, and would be fine. But the fact that your magic doesn't require consent for something that is so personal - that's what makes me uncomfortable. And I know" She rushed to add, wanting to make sure Star didn't get down about the general state of her magic again and think it was a curse. "That you can't control that, and that's not your fault. You CAN control whether you share that information with or without the person's consent, though." There was a pause, and then she added, as if for explanation. "If you told anyone about that mountain which doesn't exist, I'd be really upset at you. It's a...more extreme case than what you shared earlier, but the same idea."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was a little sad about the lost hair petting. She saw the shame and guilt and desire mixed together. She contemplated asking them to keep going but...She similarly didn't want to cause them undue grief or complicate things. She liked feeling close to Ellesandra, she liked feeling pretty, she liked a lot of things...But she didn't want to push inwards and make Ellesandra retreat. Instead, once Ellesandra had finished talking, and only when they had finished, did she move a hand up to gently place the tips of her index and middle finger on Ellesandra's lips. A tender, gentle touch that allowed Ellesandra to feel the silky softness of her skin upon their lips, but more was intended to be a playful hushing gesture. "I understand it all, Ellesandra. I understand. I had my reasons and wanted only to prevent a greater harm, but you, and a little dose of hindsight, were all I needed to set me straight." She lowered her fingers here, back to begin towards Ellesandra's shoulder, only to pause and instead move around to brush her fingers through Ellesandra's hair, much how they had been earlier. A silent assurance that that gesture was okay. She could see Ellesandra's need, of course. The void of physical affection. And she similarly wasn't making amorous advances with this...Just gently doing it to give a little comfort. "I'm looking out for myself. Finding the balance between helping you and not drawing undue attention to myself. I know I can do a lot more...But this change in my stance is only because of the things you've told me, and the things I've seen. I'm still finding the balance, but I just wanted to convey to you that I have a desire to be a lot more involved, but I hold back because I am doing what you say. My safety over yours, even with how much it tears my heart apart to see you in such peril. Because I'd rather see you with bloody wounds I can mend than tearing open the wound, the fears, in your heart that history will repeat itself." She smiled, and paused before deciding to take a bold leap: "...It's her handkerchief you carry around, right? I'm not going to pressure you to talk about it, before you tense up...I just had my suspicions. It's why I couldn't bring myself to, you know...Use it. I'm sentimental to a fault like that, I guess."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra froze up when Star touched her lips. Just the playful shushing, but the feel of her finger across her lips...it did things to her. Star would easily be able to see the desire, not just in her emotions, but how she opened her eyes and looked down at star. Her pupils had dilated and there was the temptation to pull Star closer, to slide fingers against skin rather than just her back over clothes, to feel Star's lips against hers and more skin than just that of her finger. The thing was, it was really hard to hide an attraction from someone who could literally see it in your aura, so Ellesandra didn't try to hide it. She did, however, close her eyes after the brief moment of surprise and feeling of it, to break the spell and turn her head away. A desire felt, but not followed up on. And then Star began running her fingers through Ellesandra's hair, and despite simply trying to assure her, that made her tense up more. It was easy to see the need for such physical comfort, the type of comfort she hadn't had in a long time. Not just sex, but to actually be held and cared for. She'd never had that type of thing with a mother, and hadn't even really had it with Marigold, either. She'd had a few flings she'd allow to cuddle with before the incident, but nothing where it was more than just the physical comfort after sex - at least not on Ellesandra's side. She didn't pull away from the touch, but she also wasn't entirely able to enjoy it with the conflicting emotions going on. And then, on top of that, Star brought the handkerchief. The rawness of the grief that sprang out was enough to cause Ellesandra to move out of the bed, disentangling herself from Star's touch entirely and moving over to her pack on the other side of the room, back to Star. It had been immediate, the comment about the handkerchief and how the grief had hit her. The guilt came in next, but it was less right now. Less, because the grief of hearing her voice in that memory, something she'd almost forgotten happened, and how the memory had ended - even if Star didn't get to see that part. That, on top of how emotionally exhausted she'd been from her tussle with the memories the magical armor had shown her, and Ellesandra didn't have the emotional fortitude to keep fighting it all back. She needed to separate from it; unlike Star, she wasn't practiced at having a lot of emotions and dealing with them constantly. "I'm going to take a shower. Sweaty after that fight." It wasn't an answer, and in fact it was Ellesandra withdrawing again, but the lack of an answer was at least a confirmation for Star. The handkerchief was that of the person she'd failed. It was the only physical memento left of her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star expected it might be possible that Ellesandra would retreat like this. She respected that the other woman needed that space, and to take things at their own pace. She couldn't force it all at once. To bear all that emotion at once would kill Ellesandra. Would kill anyone. So she let them go, while keeping in mind the desire Ellesandra felt for her. It wasn't...Something she disliked. Even if a comment rang in her mind, 'I would be more comfortable fucking you than cuddling with you'...It hit her heart like an injection of sour, bitter poison. But she could disentangle that, all of that, from what she saw in Ellesandra. The need. The vulnerability. Just because Ellesandra would be more comfortable didn't mean it was the whole story. So rather than get bitter and upset about it all, she quietly moved up out of the bed to follow Ellesandra. She moved up behind them when they paused and slid her arms around their middle, hands smoothing over their abdomen over their jerkin. Her forehead came to rest on the back of Ellesandra's head for a moment. And she just...Held that for a moment. A gentle squeeze then followed before she slowly released and pulled back. If Ellesandra looked at her, Star was wearing a sympathetic smile. A smile that showed understanding that they needed some space to recover, and that that was okay. "Take your time. We all need time to relax in a nice hot shower, right?" That was absolutely not about the shower, but she'd let Ellesandra pretend it was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She hadn't expected Star to get up and come give her a hug. She stiffened as she felt Star's arms slide around her middle and tighten. Ellesandra stood frozen, unsure what to do or how to handle this. On the one hand, it made her extremely uncomfortable. She didn't know what to do, and part of her wanted to step away from Star. To keep that distance, since that was what she felt like she needed. But at the same time, part of her wanted to relax into the hold. To just let Star hold her, and make the grief okay. To just let someone take care of her, for once. The desire to do that was there, but she didn't do it. She also didn't pull away, though. She just stood there, awkward until Star pulled back and released her. Her throat was tight and she couldn't verbalize a response, so she just nodded at what Star said before leaning back down to her pack and rifling through it to find a change of clothes before straightening. There was a glance given around, a safety habit to ensure leaving Star in the room alone wouldn't be a risk to her, before Ellesandra would go off for a hot shower, just like Star said. And she would take her time with it; she would let the scalding hot water give her something to focus on rather than the grief. To feel the physical pain over it, and only turn the heat down once she felt stable over it. Not that she'd ever tell Star that's what she was doing, knowing Star would get upset with her, but still.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly wouldn't find the coping mechanism to be a good one. And perhaps to Ellesandra's dismay, there was a knock on the door to the small attached restroom soon after Ellesandra started. "Ellesandra? Is everything okay? Are you in pain?" came the sound of Star's voice through the door. Ellesandra wasn't a dapper squirrel, but Star was also not a child anymore. Perhaps the first time she'd acted on it, but it also might prove to be the first time Ellesandra would have a concrete example of Star's ability to sense Ellesandra's emotions without direct line of sight, or being close by while sleeping. Star certainly explained it when they were talking about the desire to sleep close together when out in the wilds, but there was a good chance it was overlooked with the more pressing topic at hand.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ah fuck. There was immediate regret when she heard the knock and question. After a moment of hesitation, she'd turned the heat down a bit. Still enough to tinge, at least at the already reddened and raw skin, but not enough that it would be actively hurting. Best not give Star more reason to be worried about her - though now came the issue of how did she respond. Her head was pressed against the side of the shower and her eyes closed, letting wet hair hang down around her face. "I-" She started to respond, then stopped. Lying to Star would just be an insult, since she knew Star could tell it was a lie. It would probably also upset her, that she lied while knowing Star could tell. Instead, she spoke. It wasn't the full truth still, but would be enough to appease Star, she thought. "Hot water helps me process. Like - the memory you saw. The pain helps me focus on it. I'm fine." It wasn't entirely wrong. That was exactly where Ellesandra had learned that pain could help you learn. That being hit by Sia's training blade wasn't a punishment so much as it was a teaching opportunity - at least that's how Ellesandra saw it. Of course, many people would consider that abuse of some kind, but it never was to Ellesandra. And she'd taken that mindset with her into the future, in a not so great way. Self-harm was still self-harm, and wasn't actually a good coping mechanism.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a contemplative pause from Star after hearing Ellesandra's response. A combination of studying the response as well as the emotions surrounding it all that she could sense. She knew when she was being lied to. She also knew when someone was telling half the truth. Subtle cues in the emotional state made clear to her when something caused someone to hold something back. The baseline of someone speaking honestly provided the test to which other statements were contested to discern the falsities and omissions. And Star...Did not enjoy Ellesandra holding back on this, but she didn't much like how Ellesandra held back on...Most everything. Frustration flared in her heart, but...She knew that anger wasn't the answer. Ellesandra was in pain. These coping mechanisms weren't healthy, but Ellesandra wasn't just...whimsically harming themselves. It was borne instead of a lack of other methods to properly handle the emotion that burned in them. One pain to distract from another. Star understood the reason, the cause. But just because she understood it didn't mean she abided by it. This crossed a line for her. "...No, Ellesandra." She paused for a moment. "We're talking about this when you're done." Star was rarely so bold or forceful in her words or tone. Ellesandra had many times drawn hard lines for Star, and it was Star's turn to do the same. She could give Ellesandra space. She could bide her time with their emotional turmoil. She could even try not to take too personally some of the harsher things Ellesandra had said, for she understood the pains that caused Ellesandra to say them. But she could not, would not sit idle while Ellesandra practiced self harm. So Star sat on her bed, facing the shower door, legs crossed. She patiently waited for Ellesandra, expecting they might intentionally take a bit longer than usual in the shower in some effort to try and avoid the conversation, but Star was prepared to stay up all day and night to talk this out with her companion.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra felt....exasperation when Star told her no and that they were going to talk about this. She wasn't upset at Star - in reality, there was a very, very small bit that she wasn't acknowledging that appreciated and enjoyed the obvious show of caring Star was giving right now. But mostly, she felt exasperated that she was going to have to have a conversation on the way she coped with this. It almost made her want to turn the heat up more, to just distract herself from that while she was in the shower, but that would probably just make matters worse. Her hand hovered over the temperature dial, and then with a groan she turned it down just a little more and went about doing her actual shower routine of letting the water run through her hair, using some soap and such. It was about ten more minutes before Ellesandra came walking out of the shower, freshly clothed and with a towel wrapped around her wet hair for it to dry out. She wasn't looking at Star, a little bit of shame and trepidation at this conversation they were about to have, like a kid trying to get out of a punishment. She moved over to her pack, putting the dirty clothes back in there for now and then moving to take the bits of armor she hadn't removed earlier to place with the rest of her armor, near the beds. The good thing about threatening to make them talk about this when they got out was it gave them this conversation to focus on, rather than the grief that had been bubbling up before, so it had been a successful distraction technique.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star watched quietly as Ellesandra walked out of the shower and did their routine. She watched how their emotions shifted. One of the many problems that Star had come across when it came to dealing with Ellesandra and their emotional turmoils was just...Where to start? And when focusing on one thing, how to not get distracted by the thousand other things that came up. She had to bite her tongue on...A lot, if only in service of not overwhelming Ellesandra and doing more harm than good. But ultimately, she pat the bed beside her, though she was fairly certain Ellesandra would ignore that and just sit on their bed anyway. She still was going to offer the closeness. "...So, do you wanna tell me why you think scalding yourself is a good way to cope? And then trying to downplay it like I can't see right through that...It's one thing to enjoy a nice, relaxing, steamy shower. I know I love to take those, and they do help. It's another to cause yourself actual physical pain with it." Despite her needing to maintain a firm stance on this to avoid Ellesandra thinking they could just dismiss their way out of it, Star was still gentle and kind in her tone, as well as plenty worried and concerned. Ellesandra was a victim in this, after all. She wasn't out to make them feel bad for just trying to cope...She just needed to find a way to help them find a better way.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wanted to just walk out of the room, but she knew that wouldn't be productive. Not only would that be, in a way, abandoning Star in a strange city that surely had some dangers no matter what Amelia and Amara said, but she'd have to face Star later anyways, probably significantly more upset. Her eyes went to the door, and then finally over to the beds. Like Star expected, she took a seat on her own bed rather than next to Star. She also wasn't looking at Star, eyes cast down at her hands, lightly wringing in her lap. "I never claimed it was a 'good' idea." She muttered, then shrugged. "It works. And I never do enough to cause any permanent damage." Excuses, but they were also true. She paused for a moment, then added. "It gives me something else to focus on." And, unsaid but silently thought was that she deserved it. At least when it came to emotions regarding Marigold, it was cathartic in the way of feeling like she deserved that pain. Ellesandra cleared her throat at the thought and shook it out of her mind, hoping that Star didn't try to push for what that was.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's expression softened a little. "At least you recognize it for being harmful," she said quietly, more thinking aloud than anything. "And I'm sure it does work. As would imbibing a hundred steins of ale a night. Harm is harm though, Ellesandra. I don't believe for a single second that you would tolerate me doing the same, even if I sat her before you and said it helped me. I admit that there's been a lot I've wanted to say on the matter of you and your...Choice of coping mechanisms. I haven't been pushy there out of concern for you, for pushing too much too fast. I know it hurts, Ellesandra. Obviously I know. I see it. But I also know that I can't expect you, or anyone, to face it all at once. Emotional healing is a process. It takes time. But what DOESN'T help is what you're doing. I'm sure it feels like it does, and in the immediate it might. But I've called emotional pain poison before, and I will continue to call it that, because it is." She paused, her sympathetic gaze still fixed on Ellesandra. "...It makes you need stronger and stronger ways to distract from the pain as it continues to get more painful inside you. But I'm drawing the line here. I won't stand idle and watch you hurt yourself, just as I know for certain you wouldn't. I want to say much more. I want to talk about so...So much more. But I'm still biting my tongue, because there are things you need before you can deal with all that." The need for affection came to mind. The need for closeness, for physical comforts that she saw in them. "But this stops now. I know you'll still need something to help you through when those emotions get too overwhelming to face, of course...So...Let's talk about it. There are other, better ways to help focus. I'd sooner you find a training ground to stab a straw dummy thousand times with your rapier to focus on your fighting form than lay a single finger of harm upon yourself. I'm not saying I don't understand what's driven you to this point but...I am saying I will never abide by this way of coping. And I'd hope that, with us just coming off the heels of you sharing that memory of Sia with me in how sternly she spoke of looking out for your own limits, you'd understand that...Harming yourself runs very contrary to that, even putting aside the mountain of other reasons I can't let you do that sort of thing to yourself."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well, Star was drawing a line in the sand. A line that Ellesandra wasn't sure it would be smart to cross. She took in a deep breath, trying to figure out how to respond. In reality, she should be able to just tell Star to fuck off, that this was her business, not Star's, and she could cope with it however she wanted to. On the other hand, that was a recipe for disaster with their working relationship. And she guessed doing this again would also be a similar recipe. "Too bad you can't just take feelings out and make them not exist." She mumbled, thinking that would be quite a hell of a thing an auramancer could do. Plenty of people would want that skill and pay well for it. She pressed her hands flat down onto her thighs for a moment, then stood up and moved to pace at the end of the room rather than sitting. The comment about Sia was a low blow, even if unintentional. It upset Ellesandra, that was obvious, but it wasn't that Ellesandra was upset at Star for it. It more just reminded her of the last time she'd seen Sia, already disappointed in her. "I don't think Sia would give a shit about what I do to cope now." She responded, then shook her head. "I'll try to find another way, Star." She pulled up short, and turned to face Star fully. "I won't promise anything. But I really don't want to talk about this more. We have...lots of information to go through here, we should get started on that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I wouldn't do that even if I could," she said firmly back to Ellesandra, suggesting she felt that ignoring or removing someone's emotions was a horrible thing to do. The comment about Sia had Star mumble something she wasn't sure if she wanted Ellesandra to hear, and as such was spoken quite low: "I'm not sure about that." But being told they would try to find another way had a little relief show on her face, though being told they wouldn't promise anything was still troubling. She wasn't happy with this result, and from then on would be paranoid about what she felt from Ellesandra. She thought about issuing an ultimatum but...She had to remind herself that those were rarely productive. Testing their relationship by making staunch demands of Ellesandra instead of working with them was not only unlikely to succeed, but she recalled how Ellesandra had said. How they walked away from their charge, that nameless woman who did what they were going to do despite Ellesandra walking away. Yes, she believed that Ellesandra had strong cause to stay with her but...She wouldn't play that game. There was another, better way, surely, to show how strongly she felt about this all. So she tucked away that instinct to threaten Ellesandra to take any self-inflicted pain upon herself with her sympathetic healing, and banished it from her mind. That wasn't the way. "I respect that these things are hard to talk about...And I mean it when I say I don't want to push you unduly. But unfortunately my desire to not have you bear any emotional pain when talking things out is at odds with my desire to help you heal the...Deeper, root cause that makes you feel like hurting yourself is necessary. So I respect that you don't want to talk about it any more tonight but...If you can't promise me that you won't indulge that desire to cope like that, then I can't promise I'll let the topic go. Just another thing that I'll be keeping in the back of my mind." She gently sighed after those words. "...But fine. If you have other things we need to talk about, go ahead. Let's talk about them."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra was quiet as Star spoke. She had heard what Star said about Sia, but she didn't know what it meant and so ignored it. When Star indicated she could speak about something else, Ellesandra paused and looked confused. "I - I don't have anything else to talk about?" She frowned in confusion until she realized Star meant the bit where Ellesandra was redirecting attention to their mission. "Oh, that was a suggestion we go and start doing research - not talk about it." There was a brief pause before Ellesandra mumbled. "I hate talking about things." It wasn't that she hated talking about things with Star, nothing against her directly. But talking about things always put Ellesandra in a...vulnerable state, depending on the topic. People wanted to know about the person they were talking with, and Ellesandra quite frequently was unwilling to share information. She'd shared more with Star than she had anyone since the incident. Moving, the plopped back down on the bed and looked at Star. There was a silent frustration and desperation in her, in regards to her emotions and how they kept creeping up like this. She truly did just want them gone. Somehow, just admitting to herself that she hated talking about things, and recognizing how much that invisible mountain was effecting her ability to just interact with someone pushed Ellesandra forward with their previous conversation. "I can't focus on them, Star." The words were whispered. Pained. "It's too much." It sounded like Ellesandra was going to cry, but there were no tears in her eyes. Her throat was constricting in a combination of fear of admitting that, of what could come after that, and how to approach this. It was getting closer and closer to Ellesandra seeing no way out from hiding from them, beyond removing them or...darker things.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked, equally confused as...They didn't have the books yet. They still had to go retrieve them from the librarian, unless there was a plan in place to deliver them to this room. Really, Star was too upset at the time to clarify such transactional matters. She was still upset now, but for different reasons; the cuddling had done a lot to heal the previous upset. When Ellesandra said they hated talking about things, Star resisted the urge to throw a sarcastic 'I hadn't noticed' at them. The mood wasn't quite light enough for that kind of playful jabbing; this was reinforced as she saw the darkness welling up inside Ellesandra, seeing them sit on the bed and admit it was too much. Star shuffled to the edge of her bed, let her bare feet slide down to land on the floor, and gently placed her hands on the lip of the bed on either side of her so she could lean a little towards Ellesandra. "I know it is. It's had too long to grow, to fester and build itself up. It's gone ignored too long and taken too much of you for you to face it alone, too strong to face all at once. But you CAN face it, Ellesandra. Slowly. And starting by acknowledging the things that you will need to face it, before you try." She drew in a slow breath. "...There are a lot of things I can see in you that you might not realize you need. But even if you deny them, you do still need them as much as you need food and water and air. It...Made me very happy when you let yourself hold me, and just let yourself brush your hand through my hair. It felt nice. And I know you needed it, too. Everyone needs that. Everyone needs to feel...Comforted. A warmth to banish the frigid hand of loneliness." She wanted to just move over and hold Ellesandra but...She wanted Ellesandra to want it, too, instead of just forcing herself on them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She had meant going to get the books, but that no longer mattered, as it wasn't the topic of conversation anymore. No, Ellesandra felt her body closing in on itself as Star confirmed she needed to address it. The fear of doing so, the pain that was just beyond that barrier if she let herself feel it. The memory of the devastation she'd felt that night in the elven settlement, how it had crept up on her so suddenly and how overwhelming it had been. She moved to place her back against the head of the bed, against the wall or headboard, and brought her knees up close, wrapping her arms around them. It was an unconscious movement to get herself some self-provided physical comfort, even as Star encouraged her that she needed that. She shook her head, disagreeing with her despite the physical unconscious evidence being right there. "No, i just need to get rid of the feelings. I can't - just feel them. There are spells that make one forget things, right? Maybe we can find one that will work on me here. Then I'll be fine." If she could forget what happened, how Marigold died, everything from the point of that morning until after she'd left, then things would be better. Ellesandra would be confused she was sure, wondering why she'd left, but at the same time she wouldn't have this pain. And it was worth that. "We can ask Amelia." She muttered, the Myst native seeming to have a lot of magical knowledge - perhaps she would know how to do that or know someone who could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It nearly broke Star's heart in half to see Ellesandra so...Desperate. She had to take a moment to pause and swallow a lump in her throat, eyes fluttering to hold back the tears. By all that was good in the world, it was hard to decide if it was more painful to watch or to hear. Star pushed up to her feet, then moved to Ellesandra's bed and moved to her knees in front of Ellesandra, sitting between her legs, then. "Ellesandra.." she said, her voice breaking. "No...No none of that is right, none of that is good. Please just...Take a moment to breathe, and let me help you. We don't have to talk but...I'd really like it if you let me hold you, let me comfort you right now. It will help. I promise, even if it gets worse first, it will be better if you let yourself have the comfort you need."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She wasn't quite sure what to do with that offer. There was a look of confusion at Star's approaching and getting on the bed. They had literally just spent time cuddling before her shower, hadn't they? Was that not enough? Sure that had been focused on giving Star comfort, not taking it herself, but that didn't really matter; tomayto tomahto, right? But then she thought about denying it, and how much something in her really, really didn't want to. It was a warring part, a conversation between the need for that physical comfort, to be held by someone, along with the need to be independent, to be able to just shrug this type of thing off. But she couldn't, she had to admit that to herself eventually. She couldn't just shrug this off like she'd been doing. Still, part of her resisted. "I don't neEd..." She paused as her voice cracked. She clenched her jaw, grinding her teeth together in frustration at her body's betrayal. At how her body wouldn't just listen to her, to ignore the damn emotions and make them not exist. She'd been doing this for three years, then Star came in and just riled up all of those emotions again. Was it because of Star, or was it just hitting it's natural time of not being able to be repressed anymore? She didn't know the answer to that. Turning, she repositioned so that she was laying on the bed, curled up in a fetal position much like she'd been in that field of flowers when she'd been breaking down. "I hate this." She whispered, though if Star moved to touch her, to hold her or cuddle her, Ellesandra would not pull away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see the internal war going on. She watched the conflicting desires fighting each other, the desire for independence versus the very real need for comfort. She worried that it would lead to anger but...She was relieved beyond words that it didn't. Just a little bit of fuss, which might make her smile were she not so concerned for the knight. She didn't touch them last time they were like this, but...This time she was happy to slowly ease down behind Ellesandra and slide her arms around them. One around their abdomen, the other under their neck to reach around and hug the opposite shoulder. A spooning position that let Ellesandra have a little privacy if they needed to cry, something that let them have a little privacy for it. Whether they needed that or not, she couldn't say, but she wanted them to have the option. She held them tenderly, but with a tightness that reflected how deep the concern in her heart ran. A hold that silently said: 'I won't ever let you go. Stay as long as you want to, as long as you need to.'.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the arms coming around her and she both tensed, wanting to pull away, and also wanted to curl into them. The latter won, with her pressing herself back against Star. She hadn't needed to cry at first, fighting with the feelings and just keeping them pushed back, more exasperated at her situation and the fact she had feelings, frustrated at herself for them being such a major issue, than actively upset at them. But feeling Star wrap her arms around her, to hold her so tenderly, it broke something in her. She didn't know what, maybe it was that her barrier couldn't hold up against the emotions and also the need of being held finally being truly met, letting someone in like that, or maybe it was just a matter of time that it had happened. But for the second time that day, she broke down. It was slow at first, tears trickling out, but once the water gate had been opened, it began pouring out. The pain and loneliness being the biggest things right now, considering the trigger to this one had been finally being held again. Her hands gripped onto Star's arms holding her front, squeezing and curling up around them while her body began to slowly be wracked by sobbing. She kept it quiet, not loud echoing sobs, and really if Star wasn't holding her or able to see her emotions, it might be something she'd have been able to keep from her. It was shortly after the sobs started, as she was being held by Star, that she suddenly and quickly turned around in the embrace. She curled herself up into Star, pressing the top of her head against Star's chest and her arms sliding around the mage, holding tighter than was probably comfortable for her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was no stranger to being an emotional mess at times. She cried like this semi-regularly, because she knew it was healthy, if there was a need to release those emotions. Ellesandra had been just stockpiling and accruing interest on her stockpile of pent up emotions, so a breakdown like this hardly surprised Star. When they turned in her arms and embraced her back, her eyes widened just a bit. The initial surprise passed, and she then smiled. She closed her eyes, moving one hand to rub Ellesandra's back, the other cradling their head so that her hand could gingerly stroke through Ellesandra's pretty hair. She cooed soft, sweet nothings to Ellesandra while cradling them against her. Quiet words to soothe, and reassure that it was all right to cry, to encourage them to let it out. Her chin tenderly rested on top of Ellesandra's head while she held them close. The tight physical contact let their auras mingle, and while Star did never, nor would ever, have any direct control over Ellesandra's emotions, her presence did carry a deeper comfort that physical affection alone could not produce quite so potently. Much the same as she was able to ward off nightmares, her aura and its waves of soothing comforts were a bastion against the darkest parts of a breakdown like this. She dare not interrupt Ellesandra as they processed their feelings, dare not keep them from feeling what they needed to feel, but she stood as a mystical bastion against the most frightening, darkest demons that such depths of sorrow could produce, while also allowing Ellesandra to feel, in a more pronounced degree, the tenderness of Star's physical affections. It was never easy to properly engrain within another the core sensation of security that fought against the anxieties of loneliness, but Star was uniquely equipped to make that process as easy as it could possibly be. It would still take time. It would still take many more tears. But Star would not relent in her quest to let Ellesandra finally breathe, after suffocating under such crushing weight for so long. The warmth of her hands. The soft, silken touch. The warm, airy scent of a misty waterfall amidst a blossoming field of colourful flowers that Star carried. The pleasant squish of Star's figure against them as Ellesandra squeezed so tight, not evoking even a single word of complaint as Star bore the mild discomfort of such a tight squeeze, knowing Ellesandra needed it. And of course, the soothing, tranquil presence of her aura resonating beautifully with Ellesandra's own, accepting them for all that they were, and whispering quietly to them that there was peace beyond the darkness of this sorrow. These were all the things that Ellesandra had fighting staunchly against the tides of anguish that assailed them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She didn't stop, not quickly. Once released, despite having been crying earlier that day already, it was hard to stop again. Earlier, she'd ben crying from the overwhelming emotions from what she'd seen; the cruelties of life she'd been forced to live. None of it had been personal pain, it was easier to process and push away. This, though? This wasn't even really opening the mountain up; this wasn't even coming close to the true depth of pain she'd locked inside of her. Yet it was still enough to break her down, tear her walls and barriers and have the normally proud and stoic knight clinging to Star for every ounce of comfort she could get. The pure loneliness, dealing with all of this alone and not letting anyone truly touch her. Oh, she'd touched people, had even had a few romps during her travels, but no one truly TOUCHED her. Not until Star held her, at least. And this wasn't the first time, either. She'd turned her head up and eventually begun crying into Star's shoulder just for an effort of getting closer to the mage, snuggling as close as she possible could in it. Ten minutes would pass, then thirty before she felt her tears beginning to dry. It wasn't that the pain was gone, though. In some ways, it was worse. Being acknowledged that it was there, it couldn't just be shut away again; not easily anyways. So even as her tears slowed, her sobbing stopped, she didn't let go of Star, still holding tight. For Star's end, she would see that the one thing that helped the most, how Ellesandra unconsciously curled into the touch more, was Star's hand running through her wet hair. How she'd craved that, even more than simply being held.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wasn't exactly happy to be in this situation, because it did mean that Ellesandra had pain at all, but considering the circumstance, the alternatives...Yes. She was, in that small way, happy. Happy that Ellesandra was finally letting themselves FEEL. A small comfort that this was the beginning of a...Very long journey to finally finding peace. Star knew the depths of the pain Ellesandra felt. She saw it from the very first moment she laid eyes on the knight. She knew this was just the dam cracking and leaking out the first, paltry wave. But that ANYTHING was allowed to actually be felt was progress. And of course, seeing how Ellesandra loved having their hair touched, she focused more on that. Her fingernails gingerly traced across their scalp, fingers splayed as she combed her digits through the silvery locks...Whatever whimsy possessed her to appreciate the pretty silver hair, adore it, show the knight how pretty she thought it was. The other hand was still tenderly brushing against their back, tempted to push under their clothes to run across their bare back but...Best not to push it, she figured. No need to complicate it. Sweet nothings continued to be whispered, small adjustments to let Ellesandra be close to her however they wished. Only when their tears stopped did her little whispers stop as well. But she didn't let go. She didn't hint for even a second that she wanted to let them go, either. Because truly, she didn't. She could, and indeed would if Ellesandra wanted it, hold them all night long without a word of fuss. She didn't need to break the silence, either. Ellesandra had a lot to process...Far be it from her to interrupt that, or rush them. No, she was happy to just savour this moment of closeness that, even if she was doing this to comfort Ellesandra, was a moment of closeness that she herself craved. Unlike Ellesandra, she acknowledged her own loneliness, and found the knight was an excellent cuddle partner in these scarce few times she'd been able to enjoy it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra lay there, letting the comfort come, letting the pain she'd cried out slowly settle back down behind the barrier. She had her eyes closed, and a new emotion would begin creeping up that Star might notice. Shame. Ashamed that she'd broken down like this, that she needed this type of comfort. She was supposed to be the guard, the one taking care of Star, and that she was relying on Star for this sent a brief pang of shame through her. Yet, even with the shame, she didn't move away from Star. She held on, letting the feel of her running fingers through her hair comfort her. A feeling she'd always been envious of seeing in others, how they'd lay their head in their mother's lap and their mother would just comb and pet their hair - it was why that touch meant more to Ellesandra than simply being held. It had been something she'd wanted, but never had. And now having it with Star, even if it was just in a comforting way and not the same motherly type affection she'd craved as a kid, that was important. It was a few more minutes of letting herself be held, and pretending she didn't enjoy it as much as she truly did, before she slowly pulled away from Star, turning her head away so Star couldn't see her face. It wasn't like Star didn't know exactly what was going on, that she'd been crying, but the shame at being seen breaking down like that was enough to cause her to keep looking away while she wiped the tear stains from her face. "Sorry." Was softly muttered, feeling the need to apologize and separate herself a little from Star else she might start crying again - and did she even have any tears left in her right now? "I..." She wanted to say an excuse, to wave it off, but she didn't say anything else. She didn't know what to say.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see the void of maternal affection. She had heard as much from Ellesandra in the past that they didn't have that sort of comfort. Really, growing up in Ellesandra's life sounded like a never-ending boot camp. It made them hard. Firm. Stalwart, of course, but at what cost? Star didn't resist when they pulled back, of course. But when Ellesandra apologized, she gently smiled and moved her hand that was on Ellesandra's back to perform the familiar motion from before. Two fingers tenderly pressed the pads for Ellesandra's lips. Not pressing in. Just resting her silken touch atop the pink flesh. "Don't you dare apologize for finally letting yourself feel, Ellesandra," she said, whisper quiet. "I will hold you like that every night on our journey together, if you want that. I'm awfully cuddly, you know." Another warm smile flashed here. "...But more importantly, you do so much to protect me. It's only natural that I'd want to protect you, too," she said, moving her hand from Ellesandra's lips to rest her palm tenderly over their heart so she might feel it thump against her hand, punctuating that she wasn't really capable of physically protecting Ellesandra more than they were able to protect themselves, but Star was certainly better equipped than perhaps anyone else to safeguard Ellesandra's poor, wounded heart.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was about to shake her head when she felt the fingers on her lips again. It caused her to freeze, and she looked up to meet Star's eyes finally as she spoke. The redness of her own blue eyes meeting Star's, and for a moment, a different desire surged in Ellesandra. The past few times she'd felt something with, or for, Star it was more like lust than it was anything else. A desire to take her and be sexually intimate. But now, right now? As Star moved her fingers away and placed her hand against Ellesandra's chest, she found herself wanting to capture Star's lips. Not to lead to sex, but just because...it felt like it would be the right thing to do. To seek out the comfort of a partner, not sex but affection. And as soon as that thought hit her, and those feelings became identified, Ellesandra pulled back. She stood, withdrawing from Star faster than she ever had before. There was panic, fear radiating from her from that thought. "Fuck." Was muttered quietly to herself. What was she supposed to do about that? She was catching fucking feelings and that was the literal last thing she needed on this journey; another charge that she truly cared about who might die on her. The fear sent another stab of pain through her, the reminder of just how familiar that fear was, and Ellesandra was standing near the door, unsure what to do. She wanted to run, but she didn't. But she definitely didn't want to go back to the bed where Star was. She was facing away from her, trying to focus on her breathing to recenter herself and push down the feelings of more than just lustful affection. All the while knowing that Star could see them, which made that fear even worse.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly knew, in some part of the back of her mind, that their emotional bond could escalate to something stronger than just friendship. Star was very familiar with lustful affections being directed at her. Ellesandra wasn't the first. But Star was still a kissless virgin, because she didn't want lust. Not on its own. So each time someone advanced on her, she watched them for what was the driving pressure in their heart. And it had always been lust. But now, for the first time, she saw a bright spark of something more than lust for her. It wasn't that she didn't know what love looked like. She saw plenty of it in her mother, and held onto that emotion strongly. But this was a different love. One she had seen in other people for their husbands or wives or lovers, she saw plenty of it in Morrun and Lissana. And it was beautiful. But she was always able to stand by and watch that emotion from afar, away from being the source of the flame. This was not the case this time. As soon as it flickered in Ellesandra's heart, Star's face lit up with shock, and the heat, the redness, flowed into her cheeks faster than it ever had. Of course she saw it. It was...Blinding. Compared to Ellesandra's animated retreat, Star's reaction was...Paralysis in the wake of her gasp. Her heart was suddenly thundering in her chest. Her hand hovered in place where it had been pressed over Ellesandra's heart, fingers delicately trembling. And for perhaps the first time since Ellesandra met Star...Star didn't know what to do with the emotion she saw. She just looked at Ellesandra, her face beat red. She wasn't afraid, not upset, not angry, not rejecting the feeling in the slightest in contrast to Ellesandra. But Star's face was one of a woman who just had been confessed to and was trying to find the words to say. Stunned, but...Flattered, certainly. One spark passing from heart to heart, potentially igniting feelings in Star for Ellesandra all the same. She would find them eventually but...With Ellesandra's frantic state, there was a precious few seconds before Star could think of any words where they might say something or do something.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra kept her back to Star. She wouldn't have even called it love, even if it was pretty close to that. No, there was a level of it before it went to love, but the spark of that was there. It was something that can burn into love, if it could be given the opportunity. For now, it was true affection, caring, and...well, however 'like' looked. More than just the crush of a teen girl, but not quite to the point Ellesandra - even if she had been open to the feeling - would have been confessing love. Still, the fact that Ellesandra had Feelings for Star, more than just those of a friend or a charge, was unacceptable to her. While Star sat stunned, Ellesandra worked to cage those feelings and hide them in the deepest darkest corner that wasn't the mountain. She had one hand pressed against the wall and partially leaning on it, back to Star, until finally she pushed away and moved to begin putting her hair back up in a ponytail, lightly combing through it to fix the mess from their cuddle session. It reminded her of it being touched, and she briefly wondered if those feelings were simply because Star was the first person to really hold her in a long, long time. It was possible, but thinking about it was still recognizing it as an actual emotion, which wasn't okay. "I'm going to go see about us getting some lunch. Stay here." She ordered, a gruff voice that was still raw from the crying. She turned to the door, and as her hand was on the doorknob she paused. "I know.." She took a breath. "You saw that. But no, you didn't. It won't happen." It can't. She could not let that happen, not again. The thought tugged again at the mountain, the grief that was not just the grief of losing a charge. It was the grief of losing someone that Ellesandra had been in love with; someone she had grown up with, the only true friend Ellesandra had ever had. She couldn't put Star in the same position to lose again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star certainly discerned the degree of affection for what it was. A spark of something greater. Romantic affection. Love, in all its beauty, took time. Took a great amount of care to mature and blossom. But it remained that the spark was a flicker of that emotion in its infancy. And it remained the first time she had seen it in someone else, for her. So Ellesandra snuffing it out immediately was an icy talon curling into her heart and YANKING backwards to tear her chest open. Ellesandra nor Star would have the foreknowledge necessary to understand what happened next: Star moved to stand between the two beds. Her hands balled into fists. Her teeth barred. Her aura then swelled, and her eyes glazed over with a shine of mana. Despite the dampening field that oppressed all the magic that was not permitted in Myst, Star's magic, her auramancy, was burning with a potent intensity. Enough that within the confines of the room, Ellesandra would feel the connection of emotion as if the two were touching, despite standing those few feet apart. The aura that normally clung around Star's frame ballooned outwards until the shimmering rush of blues and flashes of reds, pinks, greens, and a myriad of smaller colours overtook the entire room. "ENOUGH!" she shouted, emitting a powerful rush of emotion through the room that would hit Ellesandra like a hammer to the chest. Anger. Frustration. Defiance of this decree that she didn't see it. The anger wasn't malicious or directed at Ellesandra. There was an innate knowledge with this powerful field of emotional strength that Star wasn't going to hurt Ellesandra. But there was a pounding, oppressive pain in Star's heart now. A fresh wound torn open that Ellesandra felt plainly, no matter how much Ellesandra might try to separate their emotions. And while it wouldn't be impossible to move, there was some measure of paralyzing weight to what exuded off of Star. Strangely, Ellesandra would also feel a potent healing energy rise up in them. Stronger than any healing force they had ever felt in their life, given their natural resistance to typical divine and arcane healing. There was a stirring, wild, and chaotic hum of mana that connected Star and Ellesandra in that moment. It wasn't contained or controlled. But it was powerful. The burn on Ellesandra's skin vanished. The soreness in their muscles became a distant memory. Bruises, cuts, surface injuries melted off the woman. But more than that? The ache, the stiffness, in Ellesandra's right arm tingled. It was subtle. Exceptionally subtle. But the constant ache in that shoulder and arm that was forever present got...Just a tiny, tiny bit less so. The swirling, chaotic emotions surged in the wake of this healing. Jealousy. Affection. Adoration. Tenderness. Desire. Loneliness. A tight ball of conflicting feelings that dueled between desire and rejection. "Stop REJECTING everything!" she shouted again. And in that moment, there was a heavy thump in Ellesandra's chest as their heart pounded against its cage, then pushed into a steady rhythm that had a...Second heartbeat? That heartbeat didn't belong to Ellesandra. But it beat in unison with their heart. Then, as swiftly as the emotional surge arrived, it burst into a flickering field of sparkly motes of mana, and Star's aura receded again into her, turning invisible to Ellesandra once more as Star herself lost the bright shine in her eyes and fell to her knees, clutching with both hands at her heart, heaving and trembling. Obviously alive, and looked...At least somewhat stable. But whatever it was that just happened had evoked some measure of stress in her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Fuck around, and Ellesandra was about to find out. Her hand was still on the doorknob when she saw Star moving to stand, looking angry. Ellesandra tensed, unsure if Star was about to throw a punch at her or something - but that would have been much easier to deal with than what actually happened. Suddenly, the room was completely full of her aura and Ellesandra could feel the magic coming off of Star. It was as if she was feeling everything Star was feeling, and the feeling of red, rage, anger frustration - it hit her full force. It felt like a punch to the gut and Ellesandra froze; if this were a physical pressure, Ellesandra might have been able to fight against it, to not be paralyzed by how much emotion was suddenly being thrown in her direction. But it wasn't physical; it was emotional and Ellesandra was NOT good at properly resisting that, not like Star might have been. It was the pain that got her, though. The feeling of pain in Star at how Ellesandra had so callously taken the realized feelings and locked them away. Truly feeling how she had hurt Star had her own pain and guilt rising up, nowhere near in equal measure to the current overwhelming aura but still there. She stood at the door, hand having not even moved because she was so frozen, staring at Star and not even noticing the healing energy going through her. Oh, she'd notice later, but right now? She didn't have the mental processing power to notice that along with everything else happening. The next shout caused Ellesandra to flinch, and then there was the...thump, in her chest. Like she could feel Star's heartbeat along hers. Then it all went away, and Star was on her knees in trembling in the room. Ellesandra stood frozen for a second, trying to figure out what the hell had just happened. It was impossible, to feel a second heart inside your chest, wasn't it? Her hand raised to it, and then she saw Star on her knees again. Guilt gnawed at her, along with concern and worry for Star. She stepped over to her, moving to place a hand on her shoulder but stopping. Would that be welcome? Star was obviously angry enough at her to lose control and do...whatever that was. There was trepidation now. Not that Ellesandra was afraid of Star herself, or that Star would hurt her or anything, but just...being unsure how to go forward from this. "Star..." She whispered, standing awkwardly beside the kneeling woman. "Are...what was...are you okay?" She could ask what that was later. Right now, she focused her priority on making sure her charge was alright.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The answer to whether or not Star was all right was swiftly answered. Not with a verbal response or a nod but...With Star gently falling onto her side, slumping, unconscious. She was still breathing. A bit heavy, but not obstructed or weak. Not alarm bells there. But if Ellesandra saw fit to touch Star at any point instead of just letting them lay there on the floor for however long they would be there, Ellesandra would find Star to be hot. Feverish. Sweat pooled on her brow. Star had never been seen sweating from walking or being in the heat during their travels, but Star had consistently shown sweat on her brow each of the times she pushed herself past her limits with her magic, the times she had forced herself to bleed from her nose from the exertion of her magic. Whatever it meant, Star was passed out now. After a few minutes, light trembles would suffuse her figure, consistent with the fever that was easily felt just touching the woman.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's concern skyrocketed when Star passed out. She didn't even get to the point of slumping to the ground before Ellesandra had caught her, giving her a light shake. "Star - hey, Star." She tried, but Star didn't wake. She was breathing fine, but she felt warm and she was sweating. A frown crossed Ellesandra's face and she knelt down to slide both hands beneath Star, preparing to lift her with most of the weight on her left arm and her right just being used to mostly balance the woman. This went a bit smoother than she was expecting, having braced herself for pain shooting through her right arm, along with her rib from the recent fight, at the exertion. The pain didn't come, though. Oh, it was still uncomfortable; her right arm was still weak and couldn't carry Star on it's own, but the pain didn't come from it. And it was like her bruised and battered rib had been completely healed. That information was tucked away for later, while she carried Star over to Ellesandra's bed - not Star's - and placed her down in it where they had just been laying together before. A moment passed where she watched Star, confirming she continued to breathe and just seemed to be sleeping. When the trembles started, she held her hand to Star's forehead and felt the heat. Whether that was from magic exertion or from some illness, Ellesandra wasn't sure. She pulled the covers back and moved them up to carefully tuck around Star though, before moving to her pack and pulling out the coin that Amelia had given her. If this were a physical illness, Ellesandra would have just went to get some soup and water for Star, but with that coming after such an obviously large usage of magic Ellesandra was concerned. Unfortunately, she didn't know enough about such major use of Star's magic. Did it work like arcane magic, or more like Ellesandra's magic in which it drew upon her physical strength? Either way, Ellesandra wasn't going to just leave Star there to recover. She remembered her limit of words, closed her eyes, and then used the coin to send a message to Amelia. "Star got angry and something with major magic happened. She's now passed out and has the shivers. Haven't seen this before. Can you help?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra wouldn't be waiting long before there was an answer to their query, though it didn't come from the mental message of the coin. Instead, the door flung open to reveal Amara standing in it, her face hardened with spear in one hand. She stepped into the room, looking around. Not at Ellesandra or Star of course, but she was stepping in as if looking for some other threat. Amelia was right behind, having just received Ellesandra's mental message moments before the door was thrust open. Amara, seeing no threats, looked at Ellesandra. "...Are you both okay?" she asked, clearly concerned and weapon having been ready to strike at some enemy. "There was a surge of magic detected, not one from a source the dampening field permits." Still, seeing no obvious threat, Amara put her spear on her back again. Amelia then looked at Ellesandra. "...Define 'something major magic'. Did something happen to Star?" asked Amelia, earning a weird look from Amara, clearly only more confused. Amelia rolled her eyes, briefly fishing into the pouch at her waist to produce the matching coin. "Sending coin, captain. She was just calling for help." She then looked to Ellesandra again. "...And as for whether I can help, certainly one of us ought to be able to, if you can explain a bit more." Amelia then looked at Amara and nudged her head towards Star. "Unconscious with shivers," she said, passing along Ellesandra's message. Amara was about to approach, but she looked at Ellesandra for confirmation. Amara was a paladin, so healing was certainly within her repertoire. But she had a mutual respect for Ellesandra that saw her silently asking for permission to tend to Star, given that Star was under Ellesandra's protection.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When the door flung open, Ellesandra had already stepped to the bed and grabbed her rapier. It was half out at the intruders who came in with a spear before she realized it was Amara and Amelia, having already been on edge with what just happened. She clenched her teeth, eyeing the two, then sheathing it again fully. Well, there went her promise to not draw her blade unnecessarily in Myst. At least, she hadn't fully drawn it, and to be fair Amara had thrown the door open with her own spear out first. Ellesandra eyed the spear, even as they asked if everything was okay and Amelia explained to Amara. Even with the spear on Amara's back, the look from Amara to seek permission wasn't instantly given an affirmative. Ellesandra watched Amara for a few moments, weighing the decision, but she had very much seen Amara heal herself on the battlefield. That, and knowing that it was unlikely either of them had caused this with Star, since she felt like SHE had been the one to cause whatever happened, she nodded and would step to the side so that Amara would have access to the unconscious mage. Ellesandra glanced briefly at Amelia, but her eyes turned back to Star and Amara, keeping a careful eye on what was being done just to ensure. A show of trust for Amara, but not wholehearted. "I did something that upset her, and then her magic just exploded. Not - physical explosion." She paused, unsure how much to share about Star's magic, but she had to share something, right? "While my magic is physical focused, hers is...aura and emotion focused. It was like her aura filled up the whole room, and I could feel her emotions. I can do that when touching her normally, but only when there's physical contact; never from a distance." Well there was that time outside the camp when fighting the pirates she'd briefly felt some of Star's emotions before Stare shouted at the pirate captain, but she'd been a little too distracted getting choked at the time to notice much about it. "And then after yelling a bit, she - um. Maybe magically exhausted herself? And collapsed shortly after the magical aura went away." There was obviously more to it, but that was a decent enough high level summary without going into detail about what triggered it, or exactly how Star's magic worked. No need to explain anything about resonance or how she'd literally felt a second heartbeat in her chest for a while.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara showed a look of understanding when Ellesandra almost drew their rapier. It was a tense moment, and she hadn't exactly knocked. There'd be no worry about Ellesandra being tossed in a jail cell over it. Amara nodded to Ellesandra when they stepped aside, and Amara more fully removed her spear then, setting it to rest against the wooden footboard of the bed Star was using. Close by, but she had no business bringing a weapon near Star who was unconscious. She brought it because there was worry about enemies attacking these two, something Amara idly explained with a relieved sigh leaving her. "Here I thought it was the work of one of your enemies, and I had come prepared to fight," she said as she moved to sit next to Star. She slowly laid her right hand down upon Star's forehead. A soft white light bloomed from under her palm as Amara closed her eyes. Amelia spoke while this went on. "Aura and...Emotion?" she asked, confusion and disbelief flooding her mind. Magic that she was unaware of. A fact that was clearly clashing with her ego. "So you're saying Star used...Magic? Here? That..." She looked at Amara. "...That shouldn't be possible," she said, crossing her arms as she looked back at Ellesandra. "If what you're saying is true, it means she uses a magic that isn't arcane in nature, nor divine. But the whole...Upending of hundreds of years of magical theory aside, what do you mean you...Felt her emotions? Like, magical empathy?" Questions that were given a short moment to answer before Amara removed her palm and looked at Ellesandra with some amount of uncertainty. "Well, there's...Nothing physically wrong with her. Nothing that I can sense, at least. Heart's beating fine, breathing fine, no injuries, no illness, no curse, not even really any exhaustion that I can feel, really. Far as I can feel...She ought to be right as rain." As comforting as that might be, the fact that Star was obviously not fine had Amara wearing a vexed expression. Her eyes then flicked to Ellesandra, then Amelia, then back to Ellesandra, looking for the knight's thoughts on what to do next, given Star was their charge.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded to Amara's explanation, and appreciated the woman laying her spear down away. Still close, but the obvious sign of allyship was taken as it was intended. She didn't smile, but there was an understanding there. That being said, Ellesandra still didn't put her rapier down entirely. She buckled it back to her hip while watching Amara work and listening to Amelia speak in surprise. "She told you she was a rare kind of magic user and she's looking at her home plane for information on it, didn't she? Magical empathy is probably the best explanation, yes. I don't understand it all myself." Getting confirmation that there was nothing physically wrong with her was both a relief and even more worrying. A glance was given to Amara, then back to Star. "The few times I've seen her really extend her magic and go beyond her limits, she's had a nose bleed and been very physically weak afterwards. I had to carry her after one such expenditure, and she all but fell asleep on my back. I would say it's likely that." Likely, but there was the possibility that something was wrong with her magic. Ellesandra had literally felt Star's heart beating in her own chest, or at least a second heart beating there and she'd assumed it was Star's. Who elses would it be? But Amara confirmed her heart was beating fine so... She pursed her lips and stepped up to Star. With Star's magic being as different as it was, she wasn't confident Amelia would be able to do anything, and she wanted to try something. She placed a hand on Star's forehead, testing to see if she felt the...resonance, or connection of their aura's like normal. And if she did, she tried to...feed Star's. Push whatever energy or feeling of her own aura, like she'd gotten when Star showed her how to share a memory, through to Star. As if she was trying to share her own energy and power with Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara, deciding she had quite expended her usefulness in the moment, got up and out of Amara's way, grabbing her spear to move to the other side of the room by the door, then idly left it leaning on the wall as she took posture to just fold her arms and observe. Amelia accepted Ellesandra's words with a brief purse of her lips. "Suppose she did," she said, not one to argue with logic when it proved logical. Ellesandra's attempt to embrace the resonance was met with a fruitful discovery. Star's aura resonated with Ellesandra's, giving Ellesandra a view into Star's current state. Ellesandra was able to feel Star's aura. And therein lay the problem. Star's aura was...Discordant. Normally, each time Ellesandra had felt it, it had been whole, calm - even if Star herself wasn't, and orderly. But now? It was still in one piece, of course, but it wasn't...Flowing. The passage of energy through Star was disrupted and out of harmony with itself. Ellesandra's attempt to feed their own power into Star's aura was clumsy. Their exposure to Star's powers and auramancy in general had allowed Ellesandra to sense their own aura, but there was some other force that eluded understanding within Ellesandra that gave them the capacity to grasp at their own aura and do the utmost basic manipulation of directing some of their own energy into Star, and Ellesandra would feel the fatigue build in them swiftly for doing so. It wasn't a physical fatigue, however. Rather, some part of Ellesandra that they were not in tune with was weakened. The only practical effects of this were that first, Ellesandra's nose began to bleed. Mild, just a few drops before it stopped. The other being that Ellesandra would suddenly feel like they could REALLY go for a nap. Unfortunately, this effort had not really changed much for Star. Ellesandra's capacity for auramancy was like that of a thief making first use of their lockpicks, except Star's aura was a grand vault door made of enchanted metals with a thousand locks to pick for how difficult it felt for Ellesandra do properly affect it. Unsurprisingly out of their depth to an immense degree, they really only managed to tire themselves out, without actually being tired. Surely Star would be able to explain what was happening, but they were unfortunately unconscious, and therefore not very talkative. But for their effort, Ellesandra would at least notice a tiny, single white spark had jumped from their aura, to Star's, both of which were briefly, faintly visible to Ellesandra for just a split second. But even if Ellesandra had not fixed anything, the source of Star's malaise was clear. Something was wrong with Star's aura after what happened. But Ellesandra, certainly like everyone else in this city, would only be able to guess as to what that meant. Was it no big deal and Star just needed rest? Did Star need help? Was there something anyone could even do, if something had to be done to fix her? Truly, it was likely that the person in the whole of Myst who understood Star's magic the best, aside from Star herself, was Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't QUITE sure what the hell she was feeling. Sure she was aware of it all, it had been explained and she'd felt Star's aura before, but this was...different. It was a lot more, and even as she tried to send energy to Star, she felt her own body growing weaker. This is how she imagined it probably felt when Star healed her, magically anyways. She didn't notice the trickling of a nose bleed, so focused on trying to figure this out for Star, until a bit of blood flowed over the upper curve of her lip. It didn't drop down, but she could taste her own blood on her lips, and that caused her to pull her hand away and stop what she was doing. She could handle some personal exhaustion, feeling like a nap would be nice, but she didn't want to play with powers she didn't understand if it was going to cause bleeding. Her hand went up wipe the blood away, lightly licking the bit off her lip and then sniffing the rest up a little. Well, that didn't work, though realizing her nose randomly started bleeding and Amara and Amelia were still there, she threw them both a quick glance. "Something's wrong." She muttered, head motioned towards Star. Duh, that was obvious, so she continued to try to explain. "I...I tried to reach out to feel her. Earlier she showed me how to...share something from my aura supposedly." Ellesandra was not speaking as if she really knew what she was talking about because, well, she didn't. "So I tried to do something similar, see if I could feel or empower her in any way. It didn't work but there's something wrong with how her aura feels. It's different than it ever has been before." Which was a whole loot of hooplah for making sense to anyone. Maybe Amelia would understand, but even that was doubtful. Her arms crossed and she frowned down at Star. "Do...do they have any books here on something like an aura? Maybe a soul, or essence or something like that? I'm honestly not sure the difference between such things and an Aura, except an aura is colorful and you can interpret someone's emotions and meanings behind them, if you're practiced at it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amelia and Amara watched with interest and concern as the scene played out. There was knowledge to be gained here after all. If Ellesandra had been truthful, it was possibly the wider discovery of a heretofore exceptionally esoteric form of magic. So many questions begged answering, and Amelia would be taking physical notes if this wasn't a delicate situation. Mental noted would have to do for now. When Ellesandra pulled away, there was a...cling. Star's aura latched on ever so briefly, as if trying to get Ellesandra to stay. So much of auramancy that Star had showed revolved around what one felt, rather than rational understanding or logic that a wizard might use for their spells. Perhaps it was important, perhaps it was nothing. Amelia was paying close attention when explanations began. She crossed her arms. "To be quite honest with you I had never heard the term before you had said it. So of course, I have already put in a query with Capi to answer that question. I thought it prudent given that was central to the expressed goal. And I can't deny I am curious myself. So the answer I have for you right NOW is...I have no idea if there are any books in the archive that reference this sort of magic. But the question has been at least asked. The archives are beyond massive. So as efficient as the search process is, I estimate you won't have an answer until tonight. Maybe tomorrow morning. I recognize that may not be ideal, but you will need to trust me that it is far faster than the thousand years it would take you to search manually."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra really didn't care much about their interest in a new form of magic. Her main focus was figuring out a way to make Star better. The guilt settled firmly in her gut, thinking back to how Star had just...blown up. At how her, taking that little spark, flame of interest in Star and pushing it away, had caused that. Her jaw set and she closed her eyes, blocking out the room and instead feeling how Star's aura had reached out for her. The memory of it not wanting to let her go as she moved away. After a few moments, standing with her eyes closed and letting Amelia talk about the archives, she would sit down next to Star, placing her hand on Star's shoulder. Not that she expected this to do anything, but if she could feel Star's aura, and it was reaching out to her and not wanting her to let go, maybe that was Star unconsciously telling her what to do. At the very least, she could maintain contact. It's something Star preferred and enjoyed, normally. Looking up to Amelia after a moment, she nodded. "Understood. I think I'll be here until then, at least." She was tired, from her attempting to push her aura onto Star to help. Tired might not be the right word, but the temptation to lay down next to Star, cuddle up and nap was there. Not that she'd ever tell Amara or Amelia that. "Any chance I can get a hot meal from somewhere in the meantime?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara plucked her spear from the wall and set it across her back once more. "I'll be back shortly with that for you," she said, objective-focused, but compassionate as she addressed Ellesandra. "Amelia, speak to Serenity in the mean time. I'm sure under normal circumstance, Capi will be sufficient. But nobody knows the archives better than Serenity. Not even Capi. That's our best chance." Amara carried herself with an authority in the moment, a leadership that was unsurprising given her title, but one she hoped would resonate with Ellesandra and comfort them by communicating that Amara wasn't going to just rest on her laurels on the matter. Amelia nodded with a firm "Yes, Captain," before giving one last glance at Ellesandra and Star. A flash of concern, of who Amelia was under her attitude, was visible then. Eyes that carried genuine worry. Lips that ever so subtly trembled in fear that the life of a good person was in danger. She looked away again after a moment, directed by duty to her captain to do as ordered. Amara followed behind, grasping the door handle as she moved to exit. "Be back shortly, Ellesandra." With those words, the door was gently closed, and the two walked off. Star's aura could be felt by the contact to her shoulder. It still felt abnormal. Broken, somehow. But there was method to the chaos of it all. Subtle patterns and rhythms. Some small things Ellesandra could understand implicitly. Not an understanding like what one might glean from a text, but rather just what Ellesandra felt upon themselves. It was perhaps only now, that Star's aura felt so abnormal, that Ellesandra could pick up on details that otherwise were too natural to register. The resonance that had been spoken of, the way that their auras were able to simply...Flow through one another. It was disrupted. The emotional walls that Ellesandra had always tried to put up were firmly in place, now. Perhaps when Ellesandra might want to feel how Star was doing the most, to know they were okay, it was beyond reach. Instead of waves of calm waters slowly flowing over the white sands of a pristine beach, the waves of energy, of their auras, crashed against each other as if jagged, shifting rocks shot up in the waters of the shore, constantly changing to prevent the flow of the waters from being even. Turbulence disrupted the serenity that Star's presence always had carried. But through all of that turbulence, one truth proved consistent: Ellesandra's presence was there, it was recognized. And though the attempt to mend the damage proved to highlight the complexity of auramancy in how strenuous effort was expended for little to no effect, Ellesandra's own aura still served as a guiding light on this stormy night in Star's heart. The contact that was maintained was doing...Something. How much of a something it was doing was difficult to tell. But certainly...Something.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did appreciate the help from both Amara and Amelia. She nodded in appreciation towards Amara at offering to get her food, as well as taking charge of the situation, and also pushing to get information rather than just letting this magical embodiment of a creature search for it. The appreciation was there, but she remained silent as they both left, watching the door close before her eyes turned back to Star. The feeling of her aura was...odd. Definitely odd that she could feel Star's aura, without necessarily feeling her emotions. That, in all honesty, was an improvement - minus Star being unconscious of course. A sigh and she lightly rubbed at Star's shoulder, ensuring she maintained contact while looking down into her own lap. "I'm sorry." The words were soft, obviously not expecting any response with Star being unconscious. Maybe the emotions, the regret, would be able to be felt by Star in whatever state she was in? Either way. She didn't want to push too much into the Aura field again, having almost exhausted herself with little to show for it earlier, so instead she moved to lay down next to Star. She lightly wrapped her body around Star, holding her just like she had that morning when trying to provide her comfort. She had no idea if the increased contact would help or not, but was just doing the only thing she knew. Ellesandra wasn't comfortable poking around in the resonant aura she could feel, not only because she didn't know enough about what she was doing but also because she was afraid she would poke into emotions, things she shouldn't see. If Star didn't get better after a day or two she'd resort to that, but right now she was just going to assume rest and comfort was needed. And if there were no changes from Star she would stay there, cuddling Star's unconscious form, until Amara would return. When Amara did return, Ellesandra simply raised her head and looked towards the door, a soft - "Her aura responds to being held, hoping it helps." To what would probably be an unspoken question of why Ellesandra was cuddling her unconscious charge.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star remained unconscious. Slow, gentle breaths passed in and out of her chest. Her body remained feverish. The occasional, uncomfortable shift came from her unconscious self. Movement was certainly a good sign, a sign she was more likely asleep, or something of that sort, than she was in some sort of long-lasting coma. The subtle shakes she had were persistent for a while, but after some time of Ellesandra holding her close, the shivers subsided, and a bit more calm came over her. It was quietly reassuring that she was going to be okay, but too much uncertainty still remained to be sure of anything. When Amara did walk back in, seeing Ellesandra and Star as they were, and then hearing the pre-emptive explanation, Amara rose a hand up. She was in her plain clothes again, no armor nor spear to be found. Changed while waiting for the food to be ready. A plate of pork roast, with mashed potatoes and gravy, and steamed veggies. Simple, but filling. "You don't have to explain," she said with a soft smile. "Not really my business. But I was quietly hoping I was going to be proven wrong in expecting her to still be out when I came back." A little remorse was in her voice, though not much surprise. She moved to rest the tray she carried, which also had a mug of hot tea, on the table between the two beds for Ellesandra, not wishing to overstay her welcome. She wouldn't object if Ellesandra asked her to stay, but she assumed the woman wanted to be alone with Star, so would quietly excuse herself if there was no conversation to be had.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The movement was a good sign, one that made Ellesandra feel a little better. She felt even better after that from the shivers stopping, after a bit. When the food was brought in and placed between their tables, Ellesandra would move to sit up - though she was careful to ensure some form of contact with Star as she did so. A glance was given to the food, and the tea that was there as well. "Thank you. If there's anything you need from me when we have time, let me know." A favor for a favor. Ellesandra appreciated and recognized it, so she wanted it clear that she considered herself in Amara's debt. Still, she would wait for Amara to leave before she moved to where she sat on the side of the bed. She had grabbed Star's hand and moved it so it rested in her lap, to ensure she didn't accidentally pull contact away, while reaching for food. Normally she would have just laid there, but after having given some form of energy - whatever form it was - to Star earlier, she felt like eating and not just skipping her meal was ideal. She ate slowly, letting the tea cool and then sipping at it because it was what she'd been given. She saved all of the veggies for Star when she woke; it would be cold, but it'd still be there and easily accessible until Ellesandra could go get her more food. When done, she'd set the plate back on the table, and then lay back down next to Star, taking on the cuddling position again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara gave a smile and nod before departing. While she didn't really feel like Ellesandra owed her, she similarly wouldn't deny the other woman the honour of repaying kindness if they felt they had to. Amara could probably think of something in time, but left them for now. Star remained unconscious while Ellesandra cuddled up again, little to no movement. So it was, Ellesandra got to drift away and nap. A nap that was entirely free of the pull of lucidity. No doors. No card. Just a normal drift into unconsciousness. However, being cuddled up against Star did mean there was still some influence on Ellesandra's dreams. Unfortunately, not a good one. For rather than soothe and guard against Ellesandra's nightmares, the chaos, the discordant and fluctuating waves of Star's broken aura instead ensured that, in some way or another, Ellesandra would endure visions of Star in their dreams where Star was hurt, suffering, in pain, crying...A reflection, in one form or a thousand, that Star was in distress. No imagery of Star dying, however. But pain, emotional or physical, in a single or varied scenarios, were the product of the influence of this damaged harmony. Unpleasant dreams they certainly would prove to be, making gainful rest difficult to acquire. A nap would be enough to take the edge off that implacable fatigue, but it was traded instead for regular fatigue of sleeping for four hours but feeling somehow like one slept a negative amount of time for how jumbled and foggy their mind would be upon waking.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra jerked a few times in the dreams. Seeing Star chained up, captured, falling and breaking a leg, a million different careless acts that could cause her pain. She didn't cry out or make any sounds for these, but they were certainly not pleasant dreams. When she did wake, about four hours later apparently, she felt...both better, and worse. She straightened, noticing that Star was still laying there and asleep. She groaned and stretched, feeling again a surprising flexibility to her right arm. It wasn't enough to the point that she could fully move it like before it was injured, but it was still noticeable. Was it that she'd healed Ellesandra, that caused her to lose so much energy and pass out? Or was it the general expenditure of her energy? No, she'd definitely felt something wrong with Star's aura; it wasn't simply having used too much energy. Reaching for the tea, long since cold by now, she'd take a few sips just to get the dry mouth, post bad nap addressed, before she turned her attention back down to Star. Once again, her hand moved to press against Star's forehead, feeling for if the fever was still going, and if she could sense anything different at all in her aura since before her nap.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star's fever was still present. A simple touch would confirm it, and she was quite sweaty for it. On her forehead and neck, mostly, but the thin sheen of sweat clung to the rest of her figure. Another sign of her malaise. A little worse than when Ellesandra had gone to bed, though there was no way to know if Star would have been better, the same, or even worse without Ellesandra's presence. Still a troubling sign, but only mildly so. She didn't hold the signs of someone who was seriously, gravely ill. The fever seemed to be the start and end of it. But getting worse was still getting worse, even if it was slow. Would she bounce back? There was no way to tell. Only guesswork to be done. But while Ellesandra might be thinking on this, there was a quiet knock at the door. The knock of someone not wanting to wake someone if they were sleeping, but loud enough to still be heard easily.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned while feeling that fever. That was...not good. She'd gotten worse over the nap, not better. While she might have gotten better briefly, she was worse now. Ellesandra was just considering what to do in regards to that when she heard the knock. She almost shouted to come in, but looking down at Star she was unsure that speaking in raised voices was a good idea. Instead, she released her hold on Star for the first time since her first checking for a fever and moved to the door. Opening it a crack, she would glance out, and only open it fully if it was someone she recognized at the door. She wore a concerned expression on her normally stoic face, and had obviously just been napping considering there might have been the type of red marking on her face that came from sleeping on Star like one would get when pressing their face against something for a long period of time.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "A-Apologies, if I've disturbed you," came the voice of none other than Serenity, the librarian. She was dressed in the same dress she had been wearing earlier in all its splendid elegance. She had in her hands a hardcovered book. On the cover, it had very plain and technical writing that described it: [Journal: Xannus the Clear. Transcription #22.] Below that was the date, as well as the name of the transcriber. Serenity wore a difficult expression. "It's...Not a lot. But Amelia relayed your message, wanting to know about the magic of Miss. Star. I...Hasten to admit it is truly rare for there to be so little on a subject. But the plane in question where Miss. Star hails from, Gurhal, is already something that has scarce information on it. I've collected some tomes and records that have relevant information for that matter that I can have brought to you but...I thought you'd wish to begin with something that does actually speak to this sort of magic directly. Even this," she said, holding the volume out for Ellesandra. "Is an incomplete record. It's a transcription of the original journal of the magi named. The original journal is within the archives, but it's only the first few pages. This is a copy of what can be recovered from the original, as the rest is lost or destroyed. I...Do not know how helpful it will be, but it is...Something. I hope."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took a moment, watching Serenity quietly. And then, the door fully opened and she reached for the book offered, taking it and looking down at it. Xannus the Clear? Didn't seem to be the naming convention of Star's family, at least not to Ellesandra's knowledge. What celestial object would be named 'Xannus'? Could be a report of someone who encountered someone like Star. She sighed, looking at it's thickness, then looking back up to Serenity and nodding. "Thank you, Miss Serenity. I'll..." She paused, glancing back at Star still sleeping on the bed. She dreaded having to read or study this book, it was one thing she had never gotten good at. Oh, she could read - her 'parents' had ensured that so that she didn't embarrass them or Marigold. But she never had a talent for it, and it frequently hurt her head to focus on. "I'll see what I can find in it. I - now may not be the time, but I understand knowledge is expected in return in situations like this. Can I set up some time to offer something to the library later? I've got my own particular magic which might provide some insight or additional knowledge." Even if it wasn't as rare or unique as Star's. Rare, in a way, by her unique ability to absorb and resist magic as a human, but otherwise it worked much like all other magic did.

  Serenity smiled, folding her hands neat and proper before her. The scars she tried to hide were barely visible beneath the cuff of her sleeves. "Please. Don't worry about that right now. There will be time to talk about the balance of fairness when the health of a friend is not in the balance. Focus on this, now. We can speak when everything is well again." With that, she once more flashed a smile, then gently bowed to excuse herself. She didn't want to take up the knight's time, only wished to help. She would of course stop if there was further business, but assuming not, left Ellesandra to return to Star. The transcribed book was, perhaps to Ellesandra's delight, quite small. Not many pages. It was asserted that it was just an excerpt of the full work, after all.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra closed the door and then sighed, looking down at the book, then back up to Star. Moving to set the book on the table between beds, she walked around to the attached bathroom and got a small hand towel, which she wet with some cold water before wringing it out and bringing it back into the bedroom. She lightly pulled Star's chin down to open her mouth, wringing some of the last cool water into her mouth. It wasn't enough to cause any choking, but just enough to give her a bit of water and hydration. After doing this, she placed the cool rag over Star's forehead to try and help cool the fever down. "You just had to go and throw a tantrum huh?" She muttered, not serious about the jab. It also wasn't really a tantrum; Ellesandra recognized that it was entirely her fault that she'd pushed Star that far by pulling herself back like that. Taking Star's hand she did what she did while eating, placing it in her lap to ensure contact was maintained while Turning, she took the book and opened it up, flipping through to where it looked like it started. She was careful to hold it steady as she started to read, and she read each paragraph a couple of times. Each one she had to work through what she read, the letters becoming jumbled here and there and needing the multiple iterations to fully understand. Dyslexia was a bitch when you felt pressure to read to learn whatever you could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star loosed a soft, breathy sound of...Was it good or bad? It was hard to tell, but maybe it was just discomfort at the cold. Maybe relief at having the towel placed on her forehead. She seemed to relax a little from it, at least. But she was still unconscious for now. Plenty of peace for Ellesandra to take as much time as they needed to read the book, best they could. The font was very legible, text written in a script that was large enough to be easily read. Not so large as to be wasteful with space, but it did seem that some liberty was taken in transcribing the journal so that it was easy to read for the average person, with soft white paper that let the black ink of the extremely carefully transcribed text stand out. It looked possibly to have been written by some sort of automaton; the letters were perfectly formed, so either it was done by something with inhuman precision, or it was done with such slow and excruciating attention to detail that the people who do this work must scream in abject terror if their hands slip while working.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
As she finished reading the book, she paused and stared at it. That was...not super helpful. It did give some insights, but she'd already been able to tell there was something wrong with her aura. It elaborated why she felt sick, but nothing about how to fix it. Grumbling, she closed the book and set it aside again, being careful not to do anything that might damage it at all. She also set it away from the remaining food and tea, just to make sure nothing happened to it. After doing that, she paused and then moved to toss it on the other bed, just for extra safety. The last thing she needed was Amelia yelling at her for damaging knowledge. Turning back to Star, she reached out to flip the towel over so the side on the top, surely cooler than the bottom side now, would be back down on Star's forehead. "I don't know how to help make your aura...not poisoned. Resonant again, instead of dissonant. She reached out to take Star's hand and squeezed it, trying to again reach out with her own. She didn't know what she was doing, but she did avoid doing the exact same thing she did last time in trying to just send energy into Star. This time, she was just trying to touch auras, intentionally mingle them, see if that helped at all. If Ellesandra's aura wasn't 'poisoned' so to speak, then perhaps she could take some of the poison or dissonance on herself instead. Or let her not dissonant aura help guide Star's aura back to normal. All of this was her just poking around, no idea what she was doing and being cautious so she didn't poke anything she wasn't supposed to or somehow hurt Star worse.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Poking around cautiously certainly would be something that had its purpose. The intention was there to seek the poison, to try to take it. Ellesandra might not have great control over their aura, but their aura remained an extension of themselves, and so too did it extend their intent. Star's aura, in turn, gave Ellesandra exactly what they were looking for. It was slow at first, subtle, hard to even notice. But then suddenly, and all at once, Ellesandra was subject to a flood of emotion shooting through the connection between her and Star. A surge of jealousy, formless and without cause or direction. But unlike other times where this bridge was established, there wasn't the clear divide between what was Ellesandra's emotion and what was Star's. It was just a surge of formless energy that shot into Ellesandra. A big, tight ball of jealousy without cause or outlet. Something that would make Ellesandra herself feel jealous. Except of...What, exactly? There was no answer. It had no direction or purpose. Instead, it was left to just exist within Ellesandra briefly. It wouldn't be able to last for longer than a handful of minutes, as it was not Ellesandra's own feelings, but for those dozen minutes or so, Ellesandra was left feeling jealous because of this spike of energy. It didn't need to belong to anything, specifically. But if there was something for Ellesandra to be jealous about, it easily reinforced that existing feeling for that brief period. Then, after it had expended its energy, the feeling faded, like it was never there, taking with it any exacerbated feelings that were shot into Ellesandra's heart because of it as well.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't expect the flood of jealousy. Not only had she been trying to actively avoid touching or peeking into what emotions Star had been feeling, but she also wasn't sure why Star would have felt jealous. Of course, her goal of finding whatever that 'poison' was, was her more focused goal, so when the jealous surged into her, she took a deep breath and reared back a little. Her eyes closed and the familiar sense of the jealousy sent a few memories through her. Of standing by and watching Marigold court different nobles for the sake of finding an appropriate partner for ruling. Of guarding Marigold while she was out on dates with them, and then being sent away and knowing damn well what was happening when she was. How it had eaten at her, but she never said anything. She'd always kept her practiced stoic face on, and unlike Star Marigold couldn't just see her emotions. The feeling subsided after a few moments and she opened her eyes. There was grief there again, the memories brought back by a feeling of jealousy bringing with it the accompanying grief and guilt. She clenched her jaw, pushing that down and again focusing on Star. "Why are you jealous?" This wasn't depression, rejection, like she'd been expecting. Ellesandra hadn't shown an ounce of interest in anyone since meeting Star, had she? She began playing memories back, thinking. No one had even come close to catching her eye, other than Star herself. There was...annoyance at Amelia, respect for Amara, comforting pity for Lissana - no interest in Morrun. Serenity had gained that type of protective desire, just like she had for Star, but there was no affection there. Maybe there had be physical attraction to a few people, was that what Star was jealous of? But she'd obviously been attracted to Star, too. Frustration now, and she looked over to Star, grumbling. "How do I fix jealousy I don't understand?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Unfortunately, Ellesandra's questions fell on deaf - or rather, unconscious - ears. The only clues Ellesandra had to work with was that the surge had caused them to rear back after only a momentary connection had formed. Could there be more to it? Or was that the whole story? Had taking that poison had any effect? Was that all of it, or just a dose? Questions without answers, entirely, as was the question of whether Star would get better on her own or not. Certainly still seemed possible, but whether inaction was the right call or risked making it worse remained impossible to discern with any certainty.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited a few moments after feeling that jealousy, watching Star, then sighed and reached out. Her hand once again placed on Star's forehead, and she began the same exact review as she did last time. Was the jealousy still there, was there more, or other feelings that were causing issues? or could she feel Star's aura to start to feel better? Either way, Ellesandra continued trying to pull any such 'poison' out of Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Some cursory examination of trying to assess how much or how little or how much had changed in terms of Star's condition revealed that despite 'taking' some of this poison emotion from Star, there was no discernable change in how much of it there was, or in Star's condition. Her condition was changing passively, though the complexity of it made it difficult to tell if it was getting better or worse. It was only...Different. The jealousy was still there, and once more would resonate into Ellesandra if she let it. But in an effort to find if there was more, not only would that jealousy intensify, it brought with it a host of connected emotion that would be harsh and draining for Ellesandra to feel. The expected depression, rejection, shame, embarrassment and associated feelings with what presumably was caused by Ellesandra saying the subject was off limits were all there, all able to surround Ellesandra's heart and grip it like razorwire. But the more Ellesandra tried to feel, the stronger each emotion became, and none of it seeming to really help Star by trying to 'take' the emotion. At the core of it all, however, was...Loneliness, and a gnawing sense of inadequacy. Being not good enough, feeling crippling loneliness, and each of the negative emotions feeding into one another. Star was shivering again, now, as Ellesandra explored these emotions, and in so doing exposed themselves to the formless tortures that shot into her own heart to seek out her own demons and force them to the surface. Of course, Ellesandra need only focus and shut out the emotion, or simply remove her hand, to make it stop and let it start to subside again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra tensed as she began to feel more of the jealousy. She wanted to just push it away, bottle it up and ignore it, but she wasn't sure if that would hurt Star even more. As much as she wanted to do that, she wasn't willing to risk Star. She was comfortable repressing her own emotions; not those of Star's. There was a very brief ping in the back of her head, worry that with this connection Star might be able to see or read the emotional and memory responses that came with these, but it was pushed away as well. Making sure Star was okay was the priority, after all. Ellesandra was her guard, and she wasn't about to let some emotional distress bring her down. While Ellesandra was only experienced with protecting against physical threats, it obviously was still her job to protect against emotional ones. The next emotions were rough, as they continued to sit in her. The depression was familiar, and because of that was easily ignored. She didn't repress it, but she could fight through that pretty easily considering how she'd essentially been depressed for years herself. The rejection was never one that she'd felt personally, not from a relationship or romantic feeling anyways, so it hit hard. She'd never asked someone, or actively pursued someone, and had them push her away. So that feeling caused her to tense and her eyes to close, having to work through that as it tightened around her heart and...hurt. She wasn't Star, she didn't have the experience 'working' through emotions. Her jaw clenched and she resisted the urge to yank her hand away or break the connection. Shame and embarrassment were old friends, ones that she recognized and could handle even if they just added to the tightness in her chest. But the loneliness, slamming into her. The inadequacy. Both of these Ellesandra was also very familiar with, but they were so close to how she felt too. The feeling was enough to make Ellesandra's eyes tear up again, the need to be held, the loneliness and knowing that she alone was the cause for that loneliness. The feeling of inadequacy that came from failing her one job, to protect Marigold. It was wrapped up in all of the guilt, as well, and all of that came damn near close to moving the mountain and letting all of that feeling pour out. Ellesandra's jaw trembled for a moment, but she refocused her attention on Star's emotions, not her own. To focus on how Star was feeling, not their similar feelings in herself. And as the loneliness began to grip onto her heart, Ellesandra lowered herself so she lay atop Star, directly against her and tight, and she whispered. "You aren't alone, Star. I'm here." She whispered, and sent that intention through their link, as much as she could while trying not to break down under the emotions herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  With the storm of emotions, it might be difficult to tell what exactly was going on, or what caused what. But for whatever was happening, when Ellesandra laid on Star and whispered, and sent their will through their aura, the desire to make clear to Star that she wasn't alone, that Ellesandra was there for them, there was...A response. A striking of a chord between the two. And though there was no initial change in Star being unconscious, there was a strength that formed in Star's aura that resonated back to Ellesandra. A small burst of...Something. Something good. And sure enough, following that, after a few minutes, Star stirred. She squirmed a little, eyes tightening. Plenty of time for Ellesandra to react before Star ultimately opened her eyes again. Hazy and unfocused, she took a moment to take in her surroundings. Consciousness again returned to her, though she was likely still a little out of it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't move, even as she heard and felt Star starting to come to. Her hands were now on the bed on either side of Star, elbows pressing in. Her head was tilted down, eyes still teary at all of the feelings and the tightness that was in her chest. She was letting herself feel Star's emotions way more than she ever let herself feel hers, and of course they were bringing up all of the emotions she didn't let herself feel. Memories she didn't let herself think about usually, from watching Marigold walk into her private library with a young noble girl on her arm and giggling together, to the shame she'd felt multiple times in disappointing Sia or the times Marigold scolded her for being out with a cute lass and too 'noticeable' about it, the inadequacy she'd felt when kneeling in front of the King and Queen and knowing she'd failed them, to the feeling of utter loneliness when she set out on her own afterwards, the first few months crying herself to sleep because she knew she couldn't go back home. She didn't move, focused on pushing what she felt down, focused on trying to keep taking in any of those feelings from Star that remained and not breaking down herself. Her teeth ground together, and her breathing trembled. Her throat felt tight and the knot around her heart didn't seem to go away, even if Star pulled away their aura or how Ellesandra was feeling Star's own feelings. They had successfully awoken those feelings within Ellesandra, as well.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Once Star was truly awake and cognizant, her initial fluster at the position they were in, being very much under Ellesandra in what could easily be a compromising way, was dismissed instantly upon seeing the woman above her in such distress. Star was still very much feverish and broken up, but that didn't stop her from being herself. Tears welled in her own eyes. She wasn't really able to stop Ellesandra from doing what they were doing, though no amount of trying to 'take' Star's emotions in this moment was diminishing them from Star herself. Star still felt all of it, even if Ellesandra was now also feeling it. Star wasn't able to use her auramancy to augment her comforting presence, but...She still could reach a shaky hand up and gently cup Ellesandra's cheek, rubbing away any tears if any should form in Ellesandra's eye with her thumb, or just rubbing their cheek with it otherwise.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra jerked a bit away from the touch at first, surprised by Star moving and touching her cheek. But she relaxed into it after a moment, taking in a deep, shaky breath. "I." She started, took another breath, and finished with an irritated breath. "Hate. This. Emotional. Shit." She took a few more deep breaths before she moved off of Star. She didn't stop contact, though. Even as she pulled away, her hand moved down to touch Star's shoulder until they were lying side by side, and their shoulders touched naturally. Star might be awake, but she was not sure if their connection needed to be maintained to ensure Star didn't go back into that state. Her eyes closed and she lay her head back, trying to once again push down her own emotions that came up in tandem to Star's emotions, to box them all up again and put them back in the mountain where they belonged.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  In a more light hearted situation, Star might have smiled at those words. Found them to be the endearing words of a woman who was learning to deal with the complexities of their heart. But no. She was ill, and Ellesandra was genuinely upset. She didn't have much ability to really do much besides let Ellesandra lay beside her and let her hand drop back down to her side. Her breaths were slow and measured. "...I don't...Feel good..." she said quietly. That much was...Probably obvious.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra wanted to just sleep now. To just pretend this all was done, even if she had just napped. Yet with Star saying she didn't feel good, Ellesandra found herself sitting back up and turning over to her. The wet rag had been pushed off in her touching Star's forehead a few times, so she grabbed it and placed it on Star's head again. "What can I do for you? There's some veggies over here if you think you can hold down some food, or I can go get you some tea or some soup?" Ellesandra wasn't sure if this was still emotional feeling unwell, or physical feeling unwell. She hoped it was the latter, as she would feel more comfortable addressing that, but it wouldn't stop her from addressing the emotional, either. At the very least, focusing on taking care of Star would give her something to focus on rather than the clenching in her chest, which still hadn't gone away. The feeling of loneliness was the biggest one, one that she was struggling and failing to lock away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently shook her head at the mention of food, looking a little queasy for it. But at the same time, she recognized that having a purpose, having something to do, helped Ellesandra. "Water.." she said softly. "Cold. Please.." she continued, her voice hoarse and weak. Something for her throat would be nice, though she was struggling far more with her own aura than any physical maladies. In a normal circumstance, she could just conjure water. But that, unlike her auramancy, was actually suppressed by the dampening field of Myst, much like her ability to access her pocket dimension of assorted things. Curiously, she wasn't looking at Ellesandra. She almost always looked at them when talking to them. But right now Star was just keeping her eyes focused on the ceiling now that the knight had rolled off her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took the option of something to do, grabbing the cup with the tea and moving to the bathroom. She'd pour the tea out and then fill the mug with cold water, rinsing it once before filling it again and then bringing the mug of cold water in. Quicker than going to get cold water herself from wherever it was Amara had gotten the food and drink from, and she didn't feel entirely comfortable leaving the room with Star so...off, still. She set the cold water next to the bed, but then sat down next to Star. She started to reach out to take Star's shoulder, but stopped, unsure if touching her would help or make things worse with how she was struggling with her own emotions right now. "Anything I can do?" She asked instead, letting Star tell her what was needed right now.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star tried to sit up, but gave up on that after about two attempts, finding her body too weak to support herself. The fever was thoroughly kicking her butt. She accepted the cup, though she had to awkwardly push her head up in an almost-sit-up to drink from it. A little struggling was evident, and after a few sips she fell back onto the pillow, setting the cup on the nightstand between the beds. She saw the plate, and how it had veggies left on it but not whatever else it was Ellesandra had eaten. That they had presumably saved them for her, if their earlier offer was anything to go on, inspired a storm of conflict in her where it normally would have just made her smile and be happy. Instead, her face twisted in all kinds of expressions from good to bad, and tears flowed freely. The microcosm of her current emotional state was that she was crying over a plate of cold, steamed vegetables. When Ellesandra asked the question, she gently shook her head, looking away from Ellesandra with an expression that could only be interpreted as 'hurt'.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star struggled to raise up to drink water, Ellesandra would offer a light hand to support her back and neck while she did so, at least until she could get some water in her. Then, there was the silence after, the light shaking of her head, the tears. And then looking away from her, obviously hurt. Ellesandra didn't know what to do, and was far out of her depth. Her first instinct was to go to what had helped Star when she was struggling before, which had been to wrap her arms around Star and hold her, but something told her that may not be entirely welcome right now. She stayed there quiet for a second, but then she decided to let Star decide. Stepping away without offering it to Star might be worse than offering and letting Star decide it wasn't what would help right now. So, Ellesandra held an arm out to Star. For her to turn into and lean into Ellesandra, should she choose to. And in addition, Ellesandra whispered softly - "I'm not going to leave you, Star. You won't be alone." She said that, knowing that that loneliness was not entirely what Star's loneliness stemmed from. It stemmed from Ellesandra shutting her emotions for Star away. But that wasn't something Ellesandra was prepared to offer right now, so she could offer her companionship for now at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a response to those words that bubbled up in Star's throat. She nearly said it, but...Couldn't. It was the poisonous, festering emotions in her that were making her want to say those things, to tell Ellesandra off and tell her that offering to not leave only after she had a meltdown but being perfectly fine to just up and run away whenever else they wanted not giving a damn for how it hurt her was just not how the world worked, and them feeling bad about it now was their own damn fault...The spite in her heart, that part of her saying to say that, and spit it, and make Ellesandra hurt, and make them suffer, and make them sad...That wasn't her. That. Was not. Star. So she sucked that bile back down, visibly tightening her face for a moment. She repeated it to herself. That was her pain talking. She didn't actually want that. The vision of Ellesandra crying as she yelled at them - even if the more likely result was that Ellesandra would just put on a scowl and it'd turn into a shouting fest - was more than enough to keep her vile emotions from getting the best of her. So she slowly leaned the other way and accepted Ellesandra's companionship, head tucked under their chin. And when she did so, a genuine flutter of relief entered her chest. Shaky hands moved to latch onto Ellesandra's shoulders, and then the tears began to fall. Misty-eyed before, she was now at the point of actually letting herself feel the emotions again, and it hurt. So came the choked sobs that only made her head pound even harder. There were things she needed from Ellesandra to actually get over any of these emotions fully but...She hadn't the emotional capacity to get into them at the moment. She just needed comfort, made obvious by the way she latched onto the knight when they offered their support. She was upset, of course. But she put aside the pain so she could reinforce to Ellesandra that no matter how much she was hurting, she wanted them here with her, just like this.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra could tell, even not being good at emotions, that Star wasn't just 'okay' now that she'd woken up. It wasn't all better. She didn't know what to say though, and just kept hat arm out until Start turned into it. And then she pulled Star into her, the choked sobs seeming to shoot a pang of guilt and her own pain through Ellesandra, yet she said nothing about it. There was an acceptance, knowing that their own actions were what caused this, knowing their own emotional unavailability had been what pushed Star this far. That she'd hurt Star by pushing her emotions down. THAT much was obvious. How to go forward from here - well, that wasn't. She instead focused on the current moment, pulling Star against her and moving her other hand to lightly run through Star's hair, offering that same comfort that Star had offered them earlier. Ellesandra had cried more in the past few days than she had in years, yet it seemed like her and Star just kept doing that. She held Star and offered what comfort she could, and something Star might notice was - she wasn't keeping her barrier up. Oh, she was doing what she could to prevent Star from feeling the extent of her guilt at the situation, but she was open to Star's aura, since that had seemed to help her come out of it. She was still trying not to feel Star's emotions, to not pry into those, but holding Star and opening herself where she could - she was trying at the very least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's aura was still discordant. The emotional walls weren't open and flowing freely like they normally were. So unless Ellesandra was specifically diving in and trying to focus on her, there would just be...Nothing. Just like holding a normal, non-auramancer woman. The evidence and emotion and all the rest was there to find, but wasn't offering itself freely. For having it be present for so long, it might be odd not being able to 'feel' Star. But whatever the case, it remained the nothing was 'okay', and the silence of Star's aura was one worrisome symptom of that fact. For now...She cried. And unless Ellesandra had more to do, or something to say, she'd just cry until she was too tired of crying. And eventually, she would pass out again if nothing else was done.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She didn't say or change anything, despite how much it made her worried with not being able to feel Star. Normally, this would have been a relief; not having to worry about Star's emotions overwhelming her or Star seeing too much of her own emotions was ideal, in usual circumstances. Right now, though, it was just even more concerning than normal, though. She held Star as she sobbed and cried, and even continued to hold Star as she passed out. Ellesandra hoped this time it had been physical exhaustion, just crying herself into sleep, but she silently kicked herself for letting Star pass out again either way. She should have asked what was going on, asked how she could help. She didn't let go of Star even afterwards, at least not at first. As Star continued to rest though, Ellesandra leaned down and, without thinking, pressed her lips to the top of Star's head. A gentle, soft kiss, reassuring and comforting, and it was quickly pulled away with Ellesandra lightly pulling out of the bed and leaving Star to rest. She stood next to the bed, looking down at her with her heart pounding and very conflicting emotions swirling through her. Her heart still ached, her chest tight with the feel of the loneliness that persisted, as well as seeing Star hurt like this. Was it better to let her hurt now, and then recover and go on as friends at most for the journey? She thought so, but she wasn't sure if Star would agree right now. Ellesandra was too scared to admit anything else. A sigh, and she looked towards the door, then back to Star, before just sitting back down on the bed. She couldn't bring herself to leave the mage right now, so at the very least she'd stay there with her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star certainly had nothing to contribute to the decision making process. However, Ellesandra would feel a spark of something when they leaned in to kiss the top of Star's head. A spark of life, of that familiar resonance with Star. It pulsed and produced a small measure of...Normalcy. That calm. That serene feeling that was familiar to Star's aura. A sign that the gesture helped. Not that kissing her was the answer, it obviously wasn't. There was layer upon layer of emotional complexity that made such romantic gestures problematic. But while Star was out cold? The little affection was reaching her, doing what words couldn't. Comforting her. It let her rest a little more calmly. Time would tell after she rested if she would wake on her own and get back towards some semblance of normal again, or if more permanent damage had been done.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wouldn't kiss more, having not been entirely sure it was the right thing to do considering she had no intention to follow up and do more with it. Still, after sitting down, having felt that literal spark from the brief kiss to the top of her head, Ellesandra couldn't just leave her. Instead, she moved to lay down next to Star again, snuggling up close so that Star could cuddle into her. She closed her eyes, but she didn't try to drift to sleep. No, she reached out once again, to try to see if Star's aura still felt so off, or if it seemed like it was doing better. Even if it wasn't being actively shared with Ellesandra anymore, if she could get some kind of reassurance this was just a physical rest now, that would make her feel a lot more comfortable just cuddling against Star for, if she were honest with herself, both of their comfort.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Star's aura was still ultimately far too complex for Ellesandra to really understand, there were reassuring signs. There were flickers of the familiar resonance. After the time and comfort that had been provided, and some time for Star to cry, her aura felt more...Whole? Whole felt right. Where it was broken before, some amount of it was mended again. It pointed more towards Star just being exhausted than being comatose, and though the comforts of cuddling were too slow, too subtle to feel in real-time, the comfort seemed to be the only thing that was doing any good. Though Star's magic was about as complex as complex could get, it seemed, truly, that the answer for this malady required no special actions beyond what one might otherwise do anyway to help someone who was ill, while also nursing a wounded and vulnerable heart in the process. Ellesandra was certainly good at...At least one of those things.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra relaxed some once she felt Star was doing...'better' at least. She was obviously not 'fixed' or 'healed' or completely okay, but it was a good step to making Ellesandra comfortable that she WOULD get better. She pulled her exploration back, uncomfortable with it now that she knew Star would be fine and it wasn't necessary to help. She didn't want to be invasive, even if Star probably wouldn't consider it such. She did just cuddle Star after that, eyes closed, but thinking to herself what the hell she was doing. Why was she cuddling someone to comfort them? She hadn't cuddled someone like this in...ever? She'd cuddled Marigold a few times, but that hadn't been the same. She enjoyed cuddling Star, even if it simultaneously made her uncomfortable with allowing the closeness. Still, allowing that closeness was so much easier when it was to comfort Star - not the other way around. Ellesandra wouldn't sleep again, but she would continue to cuddle Star. Simply laying there, holding her, and watching the room, letting her thoughts take hold and using that time to help control her emotions. To cage up that loneliness and get rid of it, to cage up that inadequacy, and all of the emotions that feeling Star's emotion had dragged up. She wanted to put them back down, act like they didn't exist once again, to prevent them from coming back up. Of course she knew Star would disagree, Ellesandra felt like she was already giving enough right now. She was stepping so far out of her comfort zone, pushing herself more out of it and letting herself truly experience those emotions wouldn't be productive right now.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Ellesandra did not sleep, Star did. And while unconscious, she moved from the position she had taken huddled up against Ellesandra to one that more fully embraced her desires. Hands shifted to slide around Ellesandra instead of resting on their shoulders. Her hold was tender and weak, but an unconscious product of her want to be close and to hold the woman before her. And if that wasn't enough, one leg pushed, trying to snake between both of Ellesandra's legs so that they would tangle up. Of course, Star wasn't consciously doing these things, and was weaker than her already delicate self due to the fever, so it wouldn't be hard for Ellesandra to control what Star was doing. But if they weren't going to stop her, Star's unconscious mind was going to try and settle them into a cuddle that was a whole lot more like how two lovers would cuddle up than how two friends might. Regardless of this, Star was sure to be out for quite a few hours unless woken, and it seemed whatever Amara wanted to talk about was taking a rain check given what had happened to Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt a bit of discomfort when Star wrapped her arms around her, but she'd frozen when Star slid her leg between Ellesandra's. That touch, that position ignited a desire, a need for more of it, along with an extreme discomfort for this with Star. This wasn't a bit of cuddling after a no strings attached romped. This was the cuddling of someone who truly cared for and wanted to be as close as possible to Ellesandra. After a moment of seeing it Star would wake or pull away, and her not doing so, Ellesandra lightly moved to reposition her own legs so that Star's was not between them. She did not push Star's embrace away, but the leg between hers wasn't something she felt comfortable allowing right now. As Star slept, Ellesandra worked through the remaining emotions that were gnawing at her. It was after a few hours that she finally felt comfortable and well enough, emotionally, to not have to be fighting the pain and loneliness around her heart actively. She glanced down at Star and took in a deep breath. Sleeping. She leaned in and pressed her lips to the top of Star's forehead, right where her head met skin, and then pulled away and began to withdraw herself from the embrace entirely. Ellesandra would never dare kiss Star's head while Star was awake, as it would beg questions and comments and hopes in Star. But while she was asleep, and just to soothe her aura? She could let herself do that. It wasn't as if the kiss wasn't meant, even if Ellesandra might be lying to herself about that. Upon pulling herself out from Star's embrace, lightly getting out of bed and trying to do so without waking star at all, she muttered. "Getting you some food." Just in case Star did wake up and notice Ellesandra pulling away or getting out of bed, she didn't jump to the wrong conclusion. It was with that, that Ellesandra slipped out of the room, closing the door softly behind her, and headed down to the guild hall to see if she could find where it was Amara had brought the food in from earlier.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star had some unconscious fussing about the loss of the warmth, closeness, and pressure of their legs being intertwined. Just a little sleepy groan of protest. But her sleepy figure didn't repeat the action. Then the kiss to her forehead evoked a happier sound as she squeezed a little closer. And of course, more sleepy protests as Ellesandra slipped away. She was too weak to stop them, but when Ellesandra did actually pull away, she made the vain attempt to pull them back before her arms fell limp on the bed. No wakefulness to be found from Star. Were she healthy, she might have noticed the departure and woke. But nope, out cold still. When Ellesandra departed, the guild hall was, perhaps unsurprisingly, fairly logical and 'square' in its layout. A grid of hallways made getting from one place to another fairly straight forward, if a bit soulless. It was meant to be efficient, not beautiful, though the decoration and adornments in the way of paintings, presumably of past important guild members, did inject some beauty to the cold grid of lodging. There was quite a lot to this place; there didn't seem to be an end to the ways Ellesandra could go deeper into the guild hall, but that didn't seem to be the right way to go. Back towards the main foyer where there had once been a small army of guild members sitting among the tables, there was now maybe a dozen people still awake and arranged into a few small groups. Most had weapons, though naturally those weapons were sheathed. Either returning from or about to head out onto some venture, perhaps. The foyer did have the bar where others had been seen eating, however, and it proved to be staffed with someone who would be able to provide Ellesandra a menu. Standard fare for a kitchen like this one, though there was an emphasis on discounted meals that were more bulk in nature. Whole chickens or turkeys with a whole feast of food to go with it were priced quite well for the amount of food that was on offer. With how many mouths there clearly were to feed, it seemed the goal was to get people to dine all together in communal meals rather than everyone get individual portions. Easier for the chefs to make bulkier servings than it would be to make individual plates for each guild member, so it stood to reason it was mutually beneficial. However, for a girl with a bird stomach like Star who was also sick and probably would struggle to keep anything down, Ellesandra was doubtlessly going to be drawn instead to the smaller fare, which while wasn't offered with such discount as the bulk meals, was a fair price. In particular, the soups were only a single copper piece per bowl. With the funds they had, if Ellesandra didn't mind soup every day they could manage to subsist off food at that price for quite a long time. Sure beat hard tack, at least. Also on the menu were salads, balanced plates like the one Amara got for Ellesandra, and a variety of desserts, some of which included ingredients that would be alien to the knight. Even some of the meats - while 'dragon steak' was obvious, just what was a 'trennabar flank'? Drinks were plentiful in choice, both alcoholic and not, with some easily recognized, others bearing strange names that had some colourful and fun descriptions that might be tempting in happy times, but water, tea, mead, milk, and various fruit juices were plentiful. Spoiled for choice in what to bring back to Star, though as delightful as it might be to bring Star a sweet blueberry crumble, she likely would need to recover from her strange illness before she could stomach solid food, even if it was her favourite berry.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra appreciated the efficiency of the place, even if part of her missed an artistic touch. It was her military mind that loved the very square, orderly designs, but beyond that? The place seemed boring and dull, architecturally, and Ellesandra would never say she actually liked the look of a building like this. They weren't asking her for her architectural opinion though, nor was she qualified to give any real feedback, so she went through and found where the bar was. A glance was given around the bar at everyone in it, apparent guild members, and silently thanked Amara and Amelia for setting them up here for the night at least, if not a few nights. She scanned the menu, eyes pausing on the desserts and then the salads. If Star was feeling well, she would have gotten her a nice chicken salad with strawberries and a blueberry dessert, but the idea of a sick Star eating a salad just didn't seem right. Salads were healthy, but not exactly comfort healing foods. So she focused on the soups section; much cheaper, but also probably the best thing for Star right now. Get her liquids in, and it wouldn't be too much on her stomach. She searched for one that had a little bit of meat in it along with mostly vegetables. Something like maybe some beef with carrots and such in it. At the very least, the beef broth of the soup would help, and she was sure to get a soup that had multiple forms of vegetables in there, not just meat, for Star. She did, however, ask to get some fruit on the side. If they had the option of asking for blueberries specifically she would; even if Star wasn't up to eating them right now, blueberries would be fine to sit out for a few hours or even overnight and would be a good snack if Star woke up later and was feeling like she could stomach some solid foods easier. She pulled out the group fund bag she'd brought out with her to pay, and then would head back up to their room, assuming she wasn't stopped or waylaid by Amara or Amelia or anyone, to place the food on the table beside Star and lightly put a hand to her arm to try to wake her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  No interruptions would be found on this night. The beef and vegetable soup was about as common as soups could be, right next to tomato and chicken soups. So it was, a healthy portion that was probably more than a sick Star was able to handle at the moment was given with the side of blueberries. The bartender had a brief pause at what he found to be a fairly non-standard combination but he didn't ask questions nor did he linger on it. Just a 'huh' moment before doing his job. He had the same fluffy ears on his head that Amelia and Amara had. That trait seemed to be somewhat common in Myst, with some of the other guild members sporting the same. Ears, but no tails. Not something that was ever really seen elsewhere. Truly, before meeting Amara and Amelia, there had only been one person Ellesandra had met with such features, but they hadn't said a word about Myst. Furry sights aside, Star was roused after a few attempts at doing so, the first touch or two didn't seem to be enough. But a gentle few nudges would get her sleepily opening her eyes and looking curiously up at Ellesandra, clearly on the verge of just...Passing back out if not compelled to wake up fully.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra would lightly push and gently shake Star until she woke. Part of her wanted to just let Star sleep, let her recover on her own, but she hadn't eaten anything since that morning before the fighting had happened, and she'd used her magic two major times that day. Ellesandra was worried that if she didn't get food in her, the mage might just waste away into magical dust. Not literally of course, but still. When Star did begin to wake, even if it was on the verge of passing back out, Ellesandra lightly tugged her over to look at the side table. "Come on, let me help you sit up and see if we can't get some food in you, Star. Try a few spoonful's of the soup at least, and there's some blueberries as a reward if you think you can stomach them right now." Ellesandra wasn't exactly a motherly instinct kinda gal; she was trying to compromise and offer, rather than ordering Star, but it wasn't coming naturally. She wanted to just tell Star to sit up and eat, as an order, but there was no world in which she thought that would actually be helpful for Star. "If you need, I can sit next to you to help you with the strength to sit up." She offered, as if that might convince Star if she was being held and actively supported by Ellesandra.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though it wasn't coming naturally to Ellesandra, the tender, gentle, kind way that the knight was bringing Star to come up and eat was proving exceptionally effective. She didn't fuss, and she gently nodded with a quiet 'uh-huh' at the offer of Ellesandra sitting next to her. There was a quiet, sleepy smile on her lips as she was cared for in this way. The soup would be helpful in restoring her strength, but, as it was with this auramancer, the emotional bond, reassurance, and kindness was perhaps even more nourishing than food ever could be. So despite still being very much feverish to the touch, Star managed to have strength enough to get the food into her. Slowly, steadily, she did as she knew she had to. It was more motions of necessity than pleasure, putting the food in her because she had to rather than to enjoy it, though the quality was certainly still good. Not a gourmet soup by any measure, but one would struggle to find a complaint about it. Rich broth, good choice of complementary vegetables. Certainly worth more than was charged for, but perhaps that was a perk of guild membership, even if Star nor Ellesandra belonged to the Followers of Myst. Special circumstance had them enjoying the benefits all the same, regardless. Star, as expected, wouldn't be able to finish it all, giving up after about three quarters were eaten. At that point, she laid her head on Ellesandra's shoulder, lightly panting through her lips. Just the simple act of eating was exhausting. Despite this, she still grabbed a blueberry between index finger and thumb and nibbled on it. Oh, how she wanted to enjoy them all. But she looked ready to pass out again while leaning on her companion. A reassuring sign, however, would come as she rest against Ellesandra. A few sparks of connection. The familiar feeling of their auras intertwining and the bond restoring. A sign that Star was healing, though it did come with the realization that the resonant connection between them wasn't permanently broken. It would be right back to fighting to separate their emotions each time they touched once Star was back to full health.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was pleased that Star agreed to sit up and eat. She did move to sit next to star, arm around Star's back to help support her up, and even to support her head if it looked like Star needed it. Ellesandra didn't go so far as to help feed Star, not unless it was absolutely necessary, but she did seem to be getting more comfortable with general touching since she was just casually holding Star up and against her, as needed. She didn't speak as Star ate, instead just watching to make sure she was eating alright and not having any issues or risking spilling the soup all over herself. As she finished, Ellesandra didn't push for her to eat more; three quarters of it was more than she'd expected Star to eat to begin with. A smile threatened when seeing that she did eat one of the blueberries, but as Star moved to lay her head against Ellesandra, she reached out for the cup of water from earlier. Bringing it up, she'd reach out and lightly tip Star's head up by the chin to ensure that Star got at least a little water in her, too. The soup was surely decent for hydration, but water was also important. She wouldn't force much, just enough to ensure Star wet her lips, before setting it back down to the side and turning back to Star. "Lay back down. I'll get a fresh rag to place on your head for the fever." She was a little worried that Star still obviously looked sick. Perhaps the poison hadn't all been brought out? Or if it had, maybe it was just a side effect? Either way, Star was awake now, so it was progress, but it still created obvious concern in her if Star looked for her feelings again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star did drink, and though she was still recovering she did drink more than Ellesandra might expect. Star was always pushing herself, even when she was sick. But for once, pushing herself to do things that would in the long run make her healthier was a good thing. She wasn't going so far as to make herself retch, but she clearly knew what she needed to do, even if it was hard. Being told to lay down had her nod and slowly do as asked. She watched Ellesandra as they moved about, not saying much but wearing an...Uncertain expression. Given this all was happening because of her emotional state, it stood to reason that she had a lot of things on her mind she was sorting through, though she wasn't about to speak up. There simply seemed to just be...A lot of things that would need to be talked about once Star was better, a future Ellesandra undoubtedly couldn't wait to see realized.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh, Ellesandra couldn't wait until Star felt better, but she very much COULD wait to have those discussions later. There was honestly a fear of them, afraid she would say or do something that would cause this to get worse. A fear that she didn't want to let things happen that felt more and more like they were going to anyways. Ellesandra set all of the food and drink to the edge of the table, so Star wouldn't accidentally knock them off, and then took the rag and moved into the bathroom to make it damp and wring it out again. She came back and then moved up to Star, lightly patting the rag across her sweat dampened forehead and face, before moving to place the rag across the forehead itself. After doing so, Ellesandra moved to lay in bed next to Star, not even needing to be asked to know that the physical comfort of cuddling was needed for Star. Whether that was just friendly cuddles or not, it would help some. So, she would immediately lay against the mage, not meeting her eyes, and saying - "You should get more rest now." As if Star needed the order.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star gently grabbed at Ellesandra's wrist before they pulled away after laying the rag on her forehead. She brought their wrist to her cheek and just...Pressed into it, eyes briefly closing. She didn't keep this held long, just long enough to have...A moment. A moment of enjoying Ellesandra's hand on her cheek. She released once she had the moment she needed, then obliged once Ellesandra set up near her again. Sleep was quick to come to her, and this time she would be asleep through the night until morning, unless woken.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had frozen when Star grabbed her wrist, holding it to her cheek. She didn't know how to respond to this, just let Star hold it there with an awkward, unsure air about her as it happened. When it was released, and then they proceeded to cuddle again and Ellesandra heard Star properly drift off into sleep, She tried to do so herself. Between all of the naps though, she wasn't tired. Ellesandra lay with Star for a while, giving her the comfort of the physical touch while there, but after about an hour or so of doing that Ellesandra was getting restless. She didn't want to keep moving around on the bed and unintentionally wake Star, even if Star would have preferred the cuddling, so she turned and slid out of bed softly. Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable leaving the room so instead she moved over to the corner, taking her rapier off of her waist and laying it on what was supposed to have been Star's bed, but was apparently turning into her own bed - or the 'spare bed' since they'd been cuddling most of the time. Ellesandra went through stretches, working out the stiffness that she'd gotten from all of the laying down that day, and feeling the minor strain she'd had from the very brief haste spell she'd cast before. Then, Ellesandra began workouts. Push ups, crunches, stretches, everything really except cardio because she didn't know of a way to do that without potentially waking Star. She kept herself busy, finishing basic work outs and then going through slow motion rapier practice - something she hadn't done in a longer period of time than she'd care to admit. It was a way to focus on her physical body, to feel all of herself, and to help push the emotions out of the way. When doing this, she was a physical creature, one without emotions, one which followed the orders of her brain and maintained slow, steady motions to practice control that was second nature. She did eventually come back to bed to sleep again, after a brief shower to rinse the sweat off and replacing the rag once again on Star's forehead. She'd originally looked between the empty bed and Star's, but had chosen to sleep cuddled against start considering how much that had been helping her before. And once again, in her sleep, she would completely unconsciously cuddle much closer and more intimately than she might have while awake, her unconscious body emulating the exact same type of cuddling that Star had tried to do earlier.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Just as the night before, it was once more proven that the influence of things on Ellesandra's dreams to pull her into lucidity had now power or sway here in Myst. More natural dreams were theirs to have, though cuddled up against Star naturally ensured that Star's influence was still present. It was not visions of Star in peril this time, but rather dreams that emulated reality. Star in need of care. Star in need of Ellesandra in many ways. Ways that began with simple acts of service, moving to cuddles and emotional comforts, to some moments of romantic tension as dream logic dictated the only way to properly heal Star was to kiss her, and depending on how Ellesandra's unconscious mind might react, a bit more than kiss - though as Ellesandra had never actually seen Star in a state of undress, the dream would fail to emulate such visions. The dreams remained under the command of Ellesandra's whims and desires and unconscious processes, so whatever happened remained a reflection of their own heart. And Star remained none the wiser to whatever it may evolve into. However, Star was unconsciously receptive to the intimate cuddles, so when Ellesandra would again wake in the morning, assuming nothing stirred them out of sleep prior, the two were a tangle of bodies that befit strongly bound lovers. Her smooth, shapely legs entangled with the knight's. Her arms around them. The softness of her chest against theirs, and her head tucked under their chin where she felt oh so very safe. And naturally, Star was unlikely to wake before Ellesandra. But come morning, Star would feel decidedly less feverish. A bit warm now, but the worst had passed, and her recovery was now all but guaranteed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's dreams started out...'normal'. They started out with her taking care of Star, typical from what she'd been doing that day during waking hours. They moved into hugs, cuddles, and then there was a kiss. In her dream, Star had initiated the kiss - but Ellesandra had not pulled away. She'd frozen, then returned it. Yet, when she opened her eyes and pulled away from the kiss, it wasn't Star she was seeing. It was Marigold's face, blood trickling down from her hairline, ghost-dead eyes staring at Ellesandra, and whispering - "Are you going to let yourself love a charge again, Ellie?" The fear that was holding her back, that despite the desire and affection there was, Ellesandra was terrified of the potential outcome. Needlessly to say, Ellesandra jerked awake. She even made a soft cry as she did, the formless noise coming from her throat more one of alarm than it was of any substance. She froze as the real world came back around her, looking around. She found herself pressed up against Star, leg raised and allowing Star's between her own, arms snaked around Star's body entirely and Star pressed right up against Ellesandra's chest. The type of protective hold to comfort, with no barriers for what was 'appropriate'. She stayed very still to see if she had woken Star in her rude awakening, and if there was no stirring or waking, she would slowly begin to slip back, out of her embrace. Enough to sit up, then move away, leaning against the door and breathing heavily, eyes closed with the memory of the dream - how nice it was, and then how it ended.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Star was quite dead to the world for the past while, the sudden shock and then jerking awake with the noise was enough to rouse Star. She took notice of the posture the two had assumed during the night, though said nothing to comment about it. Her fever was broken, the time was just before sunrise, not that either could really know that given the windowless room they were in that was illuminated by magical lanterns that were turned on and off with small metal dials, but also were programmed to slowly brighten at sunrise and naturally dim at night to simulate the cycle of a day passing. So it was, the room was on the passage to lightening again, slowly over the next hour or so. Star wouldn't stop Ellesandra from retreating, though she did sit up and rub at one eye sleepily once they did. Concern was writ on her face, though she didn't immediately speak up.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra didn't say anything at first, just leaning her back against the door and keeping her eyes closed, doing her best to push Marigold's dead face out of her mind. That had been a rather rude awakening compared to what had been a very pleasant dream. She'd remember her hands on Star's waist, sliding up beneath her shirt - and then that. Her breathing was still heavy, and when she finally opened her eyes and looked to Star, obviously concerned, Ellesandra shook her head. "Bad...dream." It was, though Ellesandra also had no desire to explain what was bad about it. That she'd been kissing Star in her dream, that she'd been well on the way to doing more with Star, and not just from lust either. She cleared her throat and grumbled under her breath, then focused her attention back on Star. Taking care of Star, that would distract her right? "How are you feeling? Up to breakfast, if I go get you anything?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to the answer. It explained things, and she didn't see the need to press them on it. Everyone had bad dreams. She would want to know about it, sure, but she reserved her desire to push Ellesandra on things to things she considered important, while trying to respect their boundaries on all other things. A conflicting desire to grow closer, while also respecting Ellesandra's want for privacy. She nodded again to the notion of breakfast. "Mmn. I think I am okay to stomach solid food again," she said, looking over at the table for the blueberries. She reached over and grabbed a handful, which was most of them, and began to munch on them, but not before she added another comment: "...Thank you, Ellesandra. For taking care of me." A notion punctuated by her popping some of the blueberries into her mouth, one at a time.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, relief coming through her that Star was saying full sentences again, and seemed to be doing much better. She took a deep breath again, shaking her head to shake the memory of Marigolds face out of her mind, then shoved off of the door and made her way over to the plates and cup from the night before. She ensured that Star had gotten any and all of the blueberries she'd wanted before picking them all up to take them downstairs with her when she went. "Do you want something like eggs and hash, or would you be interested in something like pancakes with berries? I'm not sure what all you're ready for, food wise. And do you prefer orange juice or some other juice?" She'd seen Star drink orange juice at Morrun's, but that was the only juice she'd had the opportunity to see Star drink, so it was best to ask and see what she actually preferred.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	All of the blueberries Star wanted was ALL of them, so, they were all taken and held in her open palm before allowing the precious berries be taken away. Being asked about her preferences was nice. "I've gotten my blueberries so probably best I have something more hardy, so I don't gorge on sweets. Orange juice is fine. It goes well with most things. But any berry or fruit juice or lemonade or tea is fine, really. I'm not picky." A smile was given. Though her life didn't revolve around food, it was still nice to be able to talk about this stuff with Ellesandra. "What about you? I know you like meats so, if you get something with meat for us, you can most of mine." She didn't want to go holding Ellesandra up to have a whole lengthy conversation about this while they were just trying to get an order together, but she figured maybe they could talk about it more when the knight got back. A less heavy topic to start the day felt right, something to keep her mind away from the poison emotions festering in her chest.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	That was exactly why she'd made sure Star got what she wanted before taking them away. She knew the woman loved her blueberries. A nod was given in regards to the order, shrugging at the return question. "I like some meats. I'm not against other foods, Star. Meat is just easiest." Unlike salads and things that you had to work to make it taste good, meats just...tasted. And they were relatively healthy for a working body. Having an idea of what to get, she'd take their dishes downstairs and find wherever it was best to place them, whether there was a section to the side for them or if she would just bring them up to the bar. She'd only glance briefly around the guild hall again before moving up to the bar to place an order for whatever standard breakfast platter they had. She would get a side of fruits for Star despite her mentioning needing more; always best for her to have the extra option and it wasn't like they were hurting for coin considering the price of the stew yesterday. And orange juice for them both. Assuming she wasn't stopped at all on her way back up, she'd balance the plates and drinks up like a...pro, honestly. She carried them like a waitress would, the only difference being a concern about putting too much of the balance or weight on her right arm. She walked upstairs gracefully despite this, and would lightly tap her foot on their bedroom door for Star to come open it for her. easier than setting anything down to open it herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star considered this new information about how Ellesandra thought about food while pensively chewing on a blueberry. She would discover the secrets of Ellesandra's culinary preferences yet. But for now, she waited. There was a bustle of activity, and a bit of a line forming for breakfast in the guild hall. But it seemed this was common, as in place of one person to take orders, there were four behind the spacious wooden counter. Orderly shuffling as people got their orders in, and a few people coming out with orders and calling out names to get people to pick up their plates progressed, and as time passed, more of a flood of breakfast-wanters came out of their dorms. The kitchen was unseen behind a set of large doors, but peeking in when it was opened would reveal the kitchen behind to be quite large, with brass appliances, knobs, and flashes of magic to be seen as the work to feed the legions of hungry bellies was underway. Efficiency was the name of this place in many respects, and this was no different. A careful eye for the food coming out would reveal it came out exactly the same each time. Each breakfast platter, assuming no custom orders were put in, came out looking identical to the last, save for minor amounts of shuffling of ingredients in transit, and minor differences in the sear marks on cooked foods. They also came out with almost disturbingly identical intervals. So each breakfast platter that was prepared arrived exactly two minutes eighteen seconds from the last one. The chefs working the kitchen were certainly human, but the truth of the matter was that a magical automation system was at their command to process this all with such mechanical precision. It didn't affect the taste of the food at all, of course. But for one unaccustomed to this, it might be a touch strange. No familiar faces showed themselves, with Amara and Amelia either being earlier risers or later sleepers than the knight was this morning. So when they got back to the room, Star moved with only a minor languid hamper to her gait to open the door and help take some of the things from Ellesandra so they needn't struggle to place things down. She certainly took note of their posture, though she had assumed Ellesandra was trained in court etiquette, being a knight. Star was not. But she still had nice table manners, at least. When there was a table, anyway. Sitting on a bed with her plate left less room to be prim and proper. She began into her food once they were all set up, flashing a smile seeing that Ellesandra had brought some fruit along as well, but saw fit to make a little conversation. "So. Do you have favourite foods? Things you really like? I get the sense a lot of what you do is driven by just what is easiest and most effective, but now I'm wondering if you secretly have a sweet tooth."

Ellesandra nodded in thanks when Star opened the door for her, bringing the food in and setting it all up properly before sitting on the bed across from Star. For the first time since yesterday, creating some distance between them really. She moved the book that had been borrowed to again ensure it didn't get damaged at all, before starting on her food with silent contentment. She'd eyed Star for a moment to ensure Star had the strength to eat fine and didn't need her assistance like she had last night, but confirming she was fine Ellesandra began eating. At the question, she shrugged. "I do, I guess." Things she hadn't really had in years, because she'd have to seek them out. Things you didn't exactly get just at taverns here and there or while cooking for yourself on the road. After a moment, knowing that Star wouldn't leave it at Ellesandra agreeing that she did, she added. "There's a plum flavored ale I enjoy, though I don't drink much ale anymore. And food wise, I enjoy roast with carrots, or a nice poached duck." An odd combination of basic hearty food, and something that was obviously more fancy. Even the ale was something that was fancy compared to some base taverns. She could probably find something similar ale wise here, but she was also on duty; she wasn't about to let herself get drunk on ale while in a strange land with her charge. "Not that I dislike meat, it's easy to cook and good to eat. So if you prefer fruits and veggies still, I'm happy to split that down the middle like we have been."

	<!--

Star Lumina	Star enjoyed the discussion. She knew Ellesandra hated small talk, but this felt more personal. She liked the feeling of bonding with Ellesandra, or with anyone in general really - but Ellesandra specifically. So this was a nice thing to keep her feeling like the two were able to just talk and enjoy one another's company, even if there was nothing wrong with comfortable silence, without annoying the other. "I'm not supposed to drink ale," she said, but still thought about the answer. "I'm sure we could find that drink for you sometime, if we have somewhere safe to be for a while." She knew from her earlier comment about Ellesandra and her splitting up that they didn't feel that way about Myst, so she left it at some vague 'maybe sometime if we feel like it probably' proposition. She did nod to the notion of splitting the food. "Like you it's not that I dislike meat, but sometimes those sit heavy in my stomach and make me feel lazy." She paused, looking over at the book Ellesandra had on what was the bed she was using before. Was that one of the tomes about her home? She didn't ask, but did seem curious about it. "I don't think I've ever had duck."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra tilted her head at the idea of Star drinking ale. She raised her eyebrows, but didn't ask why. It was likely to do with something about emotions getting wild. perhaps Wine would do the same thing? She wasn't sure, but she couldn't imagine a drunk Star. Someone who could literally see emotions having low inhibitions sounded...like a bad idea. And who knew how it would effect Star's emotions themselves. She considered the idea of finding the ale and shook her head. "No need." Star was just trying to be helpful, to do something that might be nice for Ellesandra, but she shrugged off the attempt. It was ale, and ale was ale. She didn't need Star going out of her way to try to find a specific kind of ale. Not to mention she rarely drank it anymore. "It doesn't sit in the stomach if you are moving around and being active. It processes into more energy for you." Ellesandra commented, though that wasn't entirely true. It still sat in her stomach like lead sometimes, but for the most part it didn't bother her. The idea of not having duck made Ellesandra shake her head. "If we happen to travel somewhere that I can find them and hunt them, I'll make you some. I'm not the best cook when it comes to something so fancy. There was some duck that was served to me when I was younger and it had this honey glaze they put over it. I had to force myself to be polite and not just devour the whole thing myself." Ellesandra was trying to give Star something to latch onto. To think about her eating duck as a teen, rather than to push on any of the emotional comments from the day before, or to ask about her nightmare. Ellesandra wasn't good at small talk, but she'd take small talk over hard emotional talk.
Star Lumina	Star gave a mild pout at the notion of there being no need. There might not be a NEED but she'd do it anyway. She didn't just stop being stubbornly kind-hearted overnight. Star did latch onto the idea of Ellesandra having to be polite at the notion of the honey glazed duck, but it was less a cute image of Ellesandra as a teen - though that was cute in itself - and more Ellesandra admitting they liked something a lot. So of course Star was going to find a way to make THAT happen, now. A little people skills could carry someone a long way to getting unique requests fulfilled, and Star had more than a little skill with people. But, she said nothing. She just flashed a genuine and bright smile, and let a little silence come back over them. Something comfortable. She didn't wan to push it on the small talk front. She still wanted to talk about...A lot. But that would wait until they were done eating, at least. And she still had to decide how she would even...Talk about any of it. She still wasn't back to her normal self. She still felt...Wrong.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra let the silence stretch as they ate after that. Unfortunately, Star hadn't taken the bait to be distracted by her comment, so she just let the silence build comfortably while eating. She was pretty hungry, but surely not as hungry as Star had been based on her finally feeling better after a bad fever. As she finished, she put the plate to the side with some hash remaining and a piece of toast, which she'd motion Star towards. "If you're still hungry." Turning to take the book, she also held it up. "There was also this, delivered by Serenity. Amara and Amelia were...particularly concerned at the surge of magic yesterday, and Amara helped to expedite the search for magic like yours to help understand what happened. It did help, a little I guess, but something you might be interested in. I think they mentioned that story you told me too, of the 'angel' coming from heaven." She took the book and moved to set it on Star's pillow. An attempt to focus their conversation again on the purpose of their business, Ellesandra being an expert at trying to avoid emotional conversations. If Star let her, of course.
Star Lumina	Star gently shook her head at the motion of food. She was full now. She had gone a long while without, so she ate more than usual, but even when healthy she didn't have a huge appetite. She maintained a healthy figure, not one that was overly thin and boney of course, but she was also on the lighter side. She drew in a deep breath, then exhaled slowly. When the book was held up, she tilted her head, then followed it with her gaze when it was set on the pillow. "I'll read it later," she said rather flatly. "The story of Faust's war is fairly common in Gurhal. I'm sure it'll come up a lot. Even if it is ancient history, it's something most everyone knows about; hard not to with the memorials and statues in the major cities." But she didn't want to get too lost in talking about her home. Instead, she focused on Ellesandra. "Ellesandra, we..." She sighed through her nose. "We have to talk about this. I know you hate talking about things like this but...I need to. It's been a long time since I've gotten aura sickness, and as much as I want to just get over it and move on for YOUR sake...That just isn't gonna happen."
Ellesandra	The mention of Faust's war got her attention. The same cult of Faust that had allied themselves with Black Diamond? Had she missed that name before when Star explained it? It was possible, she hadn't been paying too much attention to the people in it, more the story. Still, she was pulled from asking about that as Star went to the topic that Ellesandra very much did not want to talk about. Trepidation and concern mixed, eyeing Star and worried about her, but also preferring to walk through flames of hell rather than have a conversation like this. Still, she didn't back down with Star plowing right into the conversation. She just sighed and lowered her head, clasping her hands in front of her and staring at them. "I saw some of it, when trying to help yesterday. I'm sorry for that." Sorry, for doing what Ellesandra considered was invasive. Even if it had been absolutely the right thing to do, and necessary to help Star, she still felt like it had been wrong to do. She considered bringing up the jealousy, to ask why she felt that way or what she was jealous of, but she held back. Instead, she just stayed silent, letting Star lead the conversation wherever she felt it needed to go.
Star Lumina	Star wore a mildly confused expression. "Sorry? I don't understand what you have to be sorry for. My emotions have never been a secret to you. I...Understand your feelings on the matter, and respect them as much as I'm able to. But to me it's only fair that if ever you want to know what I'm feeling, that option is yours to have. So that it's a two way street and it's equal, if you want it to be. I don't have anything to hide, not that that really matters or anything just...I don't want you to apologize for something you're welcome to." She paused, allowing those words to sink in again. "...What do you make of what you saw?"
Ellesandra	"I don't feel comfortable with it, even if you're giving me permission. That's why I'm sorry." She shrugged. Star was giving her permission, which honestly should make her feel better about the invasion thing, but it still felt...wrong to just experience someone else's emotions. Ellesandra was an extremely private person, so even with that permission something felt off about it. She'd never interacted with people who so readily shared their emotions like Star did. After a moment considering the question of what she made of them, she took a deep breath and then stood. She moved to the front of the room, just moving to pace some. movement helped her think, at least, and gave her something to do rather than look at Star. "I get that you're attracted to me. And have feelings. And felt rejected by me rejecting my own emotions. All understandable, I guess. I'm emotionally unavailable though, Star. I'm not good for you. You'd do better not to have those feelings, or ignore them like I'm trying to." A pause, and then. "And I don't understand who or what you're jealous of. I understand your loneliness, but I can help make that better without being romantic. You've helped make mine better without romance, right?"
Star Lumina	Star blushed a little and shifted in place as Ellesandra asserted that she was attracted to them. It was true, but hearing it aloud made her heart skip a beat still. She wasn't uncomfortable, but a little nervous about the subject. Her heart was not used to the feelings she was feeling, even if for the moment they were just beginning to blossom in her heart. "I can't tell you what I'm jealous of. It would involve sharing someone else's feelings." She figured that would be enough to put that point to rest, and Ellesandra would just have to know Star was jealous but not about what. "It's not all that simple, though," she said, looking at her own lap. "It hurts me. Constantly, it hurts to see you take emotions and just decide to not feel them, to just shove it all down like they don't matter. It's not like you're the first person I've met who deals with emotions by repressing them, or should I say just...DOESN'T deal with them, by repressing them. But what caused this all to boil over is that you're..." She bit her lip a moment. This was a difficult thing to admit, but she needed to be honest about it, even if it fed into her feelings of inadequacy. "You're the first person to ever actually, genuinely have any spark of feelings for me. Something that isn't just...Lust, I mean. I've seen plenty of lust directed at me." She shook her head. "But I don't want that on its own. I don't want it when it means nothing. I've never even kissed someone romantically, because of this. So...I was so happy when we were cuddling, and you were sharing yourself with me, and it felt like we finally...Finally were able to just bond with one another. I didn't intend on it nor specifically hope for it to spark romantic feelings, but at the same time if genuine feelings like that came to be, well...I never want to deny even the worst emotions from their chance to be felt, I've even less cause to want to deny that sort of feeling." She wasn't calling it love, because it wasn't love, it was just...The feeling that could turn into love, maybe. "And unlike you I know there's no point in trying to deny what I feel. I might actually get sick from doing that, but what you've done to yourself in doing it is no better. It just is more likely to not show the warning signs until it's too late with those who aren't auramancers." She huffed, keeping herself calm as she could and speaking to Ellesandra with concern in her voice, but there was some measure of anger. Not AT Ellesandra, but a general frustration with the notion of repressing emotions in the first place. "I'm not telling you that we have to act on any of those feelings. We don't have to indulge romance. We can just stay friends. I just can't stand constantly seeing you take every positive emotion I see in you and just...Discard it as fast as you possibly can. With a little time and meditation I'll be able to come to peace with these poison feelings I have...This jealousy and anger and pain I feel." She then looked up at Ellesandra, misty-eyed. "But you have to understand that every time you discard your excitement, your happiness, the good things in your heart, it. HURTS. Me," she said, pressing both her hands over her heart. Her lips trembled, putting her on the verge of tears again. "I know you're scared, Ellesandra...Of course I know you're scared...I'm scared, too...But whenever I'm with you, I feel like no matter how scared I am, everything is going to be all right. Even if it's painful, and dark, we'll walk together in the sun again soon."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra continued pacing, not looking over at Ellesandra even as she spoke about how it hurt to see Ellesandra repress her emotions. Guilt bubbled up when she felt it, but she pushed that down - doing literally what Star said was hurting her, and thus causing more guilt, which was a little bit of a vicious cycle honestly. She didn't answer, letting Star continue and explain everything, how Ellesandra was supposedly the first person to have actual romantic feelings towards her. There was definite surprise, and a little indignation at that, the first thought going through her mind being 'what the fuck is wrong with other people?' A few more 'laps' pacing back and forth in the room, teeth clenching at the idea of how much it apparently hurt Star. Part of her wanted to tell Star to suck it up, that it was her way of dealing with things and she could either find another bodyguard or learn to deal with it. Ellesandra didn't, of course. She wasn't going to give an ultimatum like that to Star when it would potentially lead to her leaving without Ellesandra, and then getting herself killed. Ellesandra wasn't going to be the cause of that. But she also didn't know how to...not repress those things. Finally, she answered - "I don't know that I agree that particular feeling is a positive one for me, Star. It terrifies me, and I am not capable or ready of letting myself feel it for anyone. Let alone someone I'm guarding. It's too..." She paused, taking a deep breath, then adding. "Risky."
Star Lumina	Star, perhaps to the surprise of the knight, gently nodded to the explanation given. "It's not like I can't put two and two together, Ellesandra. The fear that you have, the time you told me you let someone in your care die...I'm confident I've put together at least the very basic idea of what happened to make you feel this way. I have guesses about how you felt about them, but I'd never dare assume I could define such a thing with anything more than broad speculation, and the memory of that person deserves far, far more than that sort of reduction." She gently shook her head. "I'd only ever accept 'knowing' that if you told me yourself. But I also won't press you to do that." She then paused again, looking down at her lap. "...It's a positive emotion, Ellesandra. Even if it's risky. Even if it's dangerous. Even if it hurts. It's always a positive emotion in itself. It's just the...Other factors that have to be accounted for. It can make people do stupid things, it can make people do terrible things...But that feeling itself, is always good. And in a perfect world, it would never cause the pain it does, nor the consequences of that pain. The anger that it inspires in people avenging a slain lover or family member, the...pain of loss that can lead another to take their own life, the fear that comes from how it could hurt you again." She drew in a slow, calming breath. "It can feel like it'd be better having never felt it in the first place, so you could be spared the pain. But that isn't right. It's always better to have loved, in whatever forms that may take, small or large, romantic or not. Even if it hurts...And it almost certainly will hurt us all...It's the most important emotion there is. I believe that with all my heart." She let that linger for a little while, closing her eyes as a few drops fell from her eyes. "So please don't believe it's a bad thing. Even if you can't let yourself indulge it...Just let it live. Even if you're not the person I'm meant to have my first kiss with, or the one who will let me finally feel romantic love blossom in my heart...Just please...Please let that part of you live."
Ellesandra	That mountain stirred. Ellesandra's pacing became more frantic, and with not much space it became more heavy steps than anything. Star didn't have to say what happened for Ellesandra's mind to go to Marigold, and that was even easier considering the recent end to her dream. But the assertion that love was a positive emotion? Anger, mixed with grief and pain. She eventually came to a stop, that pain having only been building as Star continued to talk about the 'good' it could do. About how it could inspire anger, and pain, but it was an overall good emotion. 'even if it hurts' made Ellesandra snort, and she turned to glare at Star. "Nothing." She said in a low, angry voice. "That makes you feel this way is a GOOD thing, Star." Her voice trembled, a combination of the grief and anger that was filling her right now. She was holding herself together, but barely. The mountain was frayed between everything that had happened the past few days, how Star seemed to just tear down every wall and barrier Ellesandra had. How Ellesandra, deep deep down, wanted to be able to feel that emotion with Star, but was absolutely terrified of it creating a second mountain. She knew Star could see the conflict in her, the anger, the grief that just kept getting worse as this conversation had gone on. She stepped up to Star, taking Star's hand and placing it to her chest, right over where that figurative mountain rested. She stared into Star's eyes, in her anger lashing out and trying to MAKE Star feel that grief. The enormity of it, how even now when Ellesandra let herself feel it, didn't distract herself from it or repress it, it was enough to make her want to do very, very rash things to herself to escape it. The guilt that was circled around it, the main thing Ellesandra had felt in Star's presence in regards to this, was but a portion of the mountain that Ellesandra was finally recognizing. Finally acknowledging and feeling. "I. Can't." She whispered, tears having sprouted up, the whisper choked through a tightening throat. "Do that. Again."
Star Lumina	Star could see the height of emotion in Ellesandra. She knew it was dangerous to prod such powerful emotions, but she believed that she and Ellesandra had become close enough that she could do so without Ellesandra thinking she was just prying, or something. She was doing this out of genuine concern. She cared so much about Ellesandra that it was physically paining her to watch the other woman torture themselves like this. She didn't need to be in love with them for it to hurt...But it certainly had come to hurt much more over the time she had known the knight. It only steadily grew worse. When Ellesandra walked up to her and placed her hand upon their heart, she didn't resist. She let the emotion in. And it hurt. It inspired her own grief and her own pains. Those poison emotions that already were within her festered, tearing her apart from the inside as they were fed more of their ilk from Ellesandra. But even as it began to make Star cry, made her wince at the pain of it all, made her need to brace against the waves of torment that threatened to just break her down into tears, she stood firm. These were emotions. These were her domain. There was no easy answers to any of this...But if Ellesandra could stand and fight an enemy that could take a dagger to the brain and keep on fighting without losing their resolve, then Star could stand tall even as a mountain was falling down on her, threatening to crush her. "It's not love that makes you feel this way, Ellesandra," she said, her voice barely a whisper. Hand shaking. Voice trembling. Tears falling. "It's...Loss...It's having lost what once made you so happy. And by all that is good in the world, nothing makes me so...Sad, and angry, and filled with despair as knowing that happiness was lost to you." She then summoned the courage to look Ellesandra in the eyes, her fingers curling into the fabric of Ellesandra's top above their heart, as if wanting to reach in and cradle their heart directly. "But it is not love that makes you hurt. It's the void of what was once there. And I would never make you feel that a second time, Ellesandra. I can't ask you t-to..." She choked through another sob, briefly looking down again before turning her watery eyes back up. "To act on it...But a heart as big and kind as yours deserves to feel that feeling again, if that is what blossoms within it. Even if it is never indulged...It doesn't belong in a cage."
Ellesandra	The sight of how it made Star cry, how she began to shake and tremble in response to the emotions immediately sent more guilt through Ellesandra. That had been harsh, to forced Star to feel the same pain that she felt. She'd felt that pain for years, in small amounts. It had been incredibly cruel to force it on Star. Yet even as she considered pulling away, Star curled her fingers into the fabric and held on. "It does." She disagreed, shaking her head. "If it doesn't get felt, it can't do THIS again." Her head dropped and she stared down at the ground between them, her own tears again falling down her cheeks and dripping onto the floor between the two. She tried to put the pain away, to lock it back up, to close that mountain and send it back to it's invisible path in her but...she couldn't. She'd opened it up, and this time she had someone there, offering comfort. Offering to help her through it. And even though in her mind she wanted to close it down, to push it away and prevent it from hurting her anymore, from hurting Star from their connection, she couldn't put it back in it's box. As soon as she realized that too much had come out, that the grief was becoming overwhelming, that she couldn't just push it away, she collapsed into Star. Her head dropped into Star's neck and a wail of grief and pain like no one would have ever expected to hear from the stoic knight came out. The mountain began to crumble and the years of repressed feelings began pouring out. The nights of crying right after Marigold died, and not being able to handle it so she had begun slowly to bundle it up and push it down. The nights of loneliness, the feeling of being utterly alone in the world, abandoned by the only remaining family she'd had afterwards. The supreme guilt for not stopping Mari, for letting her go through with the plan, for not fighting harder against it. For not being there sooner, doing things differently. And more than anything, the grief of losing Marigold - the only person who had been a true friend her entire life. The woman she'd fallen in love with as a teen, and that love had grown only over time. It had never been returned, not in the same way, and there was always some pain in that, but it was nothing compared to the absolute loss of Marigold. She gripped onto Star, hands finding their way to dig into Stars shirt and pull her close even while she moved onto the bed with Star, her legs fully giving out as she literally collapsed, both emotionally and physically.
Star Lumina	Star felt the weight of Ellesandra's emotions before she felt the weight of their body. But she felt both. And she knew it was going to hurt. But she didn't fight it. She opened her arms just as she opened her heart, accepting Ellesandra onto her as the woman collapsed onto her. She held them as she fell backwards, keeping Ellesandra atop her as everything came crumbling down. Star's heart beat a powerful thud in her chest, and it seemed all at once that the poison in her was banished. It was the rejection of it all that had hurt her so, and the moment of acceptance, of Ellesandra letting themselves feel it all, was enough to have Star gasping as if she had come up from a thousand feet underwater. The resonance of her aura sung out again, and in doing so did it allow hers and Ellesandra's auras to mingle as they once did, which of course meant the outpouring of Ellesandra's grief was felt in equal measure by Star, as it was too overwhelming a force of emotion for even her, the mystic of emotion, to close off. So she held Ellesandra, clutching onto them, holding them for dear life as the mystic empathy carried her into Ellesandra's heart and allowed her to truly connect with the other woman, no matter how painful that was. Tears streamed for her eyes and choked sobs left her...But even through the pain, one trembling hand held onto the small of Ellesandra's back, while the other stroked through the knight's hair. She kept the other woman's head tucked under hers, cradling them close. There were no words for this moment. Nothing that could give any measure of comfort against this onslaught of grief and pain...There was only comfort in one another. The constant, ever-present reminder to Ellesandra that they were not alone. That through this pain, no matter how intense it was, Star was right there with them.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't have much awareness of what was happening, physically. The only thing she knew was she was curling into Stars body, hands grasping her shirt like somehow holding onto her shirt would prevent Ellesandra from drowning in these emotions. It didn't. She didn't notice being pulled onto the bed, she didn't notice the touch on her back and the comforting pets to her hair. Oh part of her took comfort in the touch, but it was so far beyond and behind the feeling of grief and pain that it wasn't an active thought. She sobbed, holding onto Star in the wettest, loudest sobs she'd ever truly had. She'd cried plenty right after the incident, but this had been in her bedroll alone, keeping it quiet and trying to fight it down. She wasn't fighting it anymore though - she felt every bit of it. She didn't even realize that Star was sobbing as well, was feeling and experiencing this grief with her. It would be thirty minutes before her sobbing even began to calm, but even then she still had her head hidden, tears fallen, and large, almost hyperventilating breaths. Unlike Star, she didn't know how to handle this large influx of pain. It was more than pain, but that was so much of it that it's all she could actually feel. It overwhelmed every emotional sense she had, and even as the sobbing stopped it was more because of her physical exhaustion from crying so hard than there not being the pain to sob over.
Star Lumina	Star could handle the pain where Ellesandra could not. It was her greatest strength to be able to face even the darkest emotions, and though they might wound her, she could recover from them. Her purity of self had found itself within her once more, and so came the soothing presence she exuded. It was but a drop in a bucket against a tide of grief as soul-crushing as Ellesandra's, but it would remain there. Time was something of an illusion while they sobbed together, throats becoming hoarse and eyes turning puffy and red. There had been...A lot of crying when they were together. And Star was fine with that. She cried when she had to cry, so that when it came time to laugh or to smile or to love or to feel whatever it is her heart needed to feel, she was able to feel it to its fullest. And though she knew this would not be the end of pain for Ellesandra, truly just the beginning of a long and hard road ahead, it was the first step. The hardest step. And even if it resulted in Ellesandra falling flat on top of Star in how hard it made them stumble, it still was a step that was now behind them. So she cried. She cried as long as she could until her head pounded and her face was a mess. And she kept holding Ellesandra through it, still comforting them, and having only the presence of mind to make a little adjustment so they were both fully on the bed. Otherwise...Little changed in the time they cried. Time, and comfort, were all they had for the moment. There would be much to talk about, much for Star to do to help Ellesandra slowly relinquish this crippling fear. And the desire to face it through every tear and every sob and every wail burned in every fiber of Star's being. Ellesandra's heart had reached out to her. It looked upon Star and allowed a spark of something long buried to live again. Star would guard that with all that she had, though she also knew that part of guarding that fragile heart meant she, herself, had to stay strong, and relinquish many of her own fears and insecurities that could lead to only another tragedy. Star knew in her heart that Ellesandra could survive this. But nobody...Nobody could survive this twice.
Ellesandra	She didn't know how much time had passed before she was able to finally draw in breath without crying. Her body had been trembling, shaking, and she hadn't even noticed it. Her eyes hurt, exhausted from crying, red and puffy and upset. Her throat was raw, and still tight. Her body ached from the shaking, her chest felt like there was an elephant sitting on it, and god she hurt, emotionally. Even though she was done crying, it was still painful. It was still so much that she couldn't speak, though she opened her mouth to apologize once she realized she'd been laying on top of Star and sobbing on her, and Star had been sobbing as well. She wanted to apologize, to pull back within herself, to spend time bundling the rest of the emotion that was still hurting back up and pushing it back down. But she couldn't. She couldn't bring herself to do anything. So now she moved to just lay against the bed, rather than on top of Star, and curled up. The depression was hitting, more than the active pain now. The question of why she was even there, why she should bother doing anything when it just hurt this much. But it was progress, really. The mountain was still there, but it was actively there, not being ignored. She closed her eyes, unable to hold back the memories that came with it. She tried to not let them come in, to focus on the present, but she couldn't. And each memory seemed to just make the pain worse, to the point she'd cuddled back up into a fetal position next to Star.
Star Lumina	Star didn't have the source of the pain in her heart, so it was naturally much easier for her to recuperate from the pain. But even without the source of Ellesandra's grief, she had her own: someone she cared about dearly was in pain. That was enough to keep the weight heavy on her heart, but that sort of pain, that sort of weight was something that inspired action, rather than defeat. So when Ellesandra curled up into the fetal position, Star was right there behind them. She was more than happy to have kept the other woman on top of her - something that in happier circumstances would make her blush up a storm - but she could sympathize with Ellesandra's need to curl up like that. Star wouldn't have wanted an apology, to the point that such a thing might make her mad. Even if she didn't say it, she did hate the idea of Ellesandra apologizing for being in so much pain. She equated it to her bleeding, on death's door, and apologizing to Ellesandra for getting blood on their clothes. All of that was pushed away though, for in the moment, Ellesandra needed her. And she wouldn't be going anywhere. She turned to face their back and slid her arms around them. She pulled their bodies close again, and just as Ellesandra had spent so much time comforting Star the past day or however long it had been at this point since her heart released that vitriolic poison into her, she would care for the other woman now. Her nose buried in Ellesandra's hair. One arm around their abdomen, snaked in between Ellesandra's thighs and middle, and the other around their shoulders, above their arms. "I'm right here, Ellesandra. I'm right here, I always will be. I promise I'll fight with everything that I have to stay right here, by your side. So long as you'll have me, I'm right here."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra felt Star move to be the big spoon and cuddle against her. Feeling Star's arm around her abdomen, and the other around her shoulders, while she heard Star's comforting words just behind her - it helped. She didn't respond, only curled up onto herself more, but it wasn't a matter of pulling away from Star more than Star's touch, while healing, also reminded her of the loneliness. How she hadn't had this, how she'd not let anyone touch her and how much she needed this type of affectionate comfort. How she'd been all alone after leaving, and no one was there to hold her while she cried. She wasn't sobbing anymore. Oh, there were still tears, but it was as if her body was telling her it was too tired to keep that up. The depression weighed on her and when she considered getting up, trying to go about their day and mission, the motivation to move at all was just...not there. The only motivation she had was to not exist, which wasn't to say she was actively considering acting on that right now - just that in the back of her mind, the desire to not be there anymore was certainly there. Finally, after some time just laying there, having gotten control and grounded about some of her thoughts and beginning to push the memories away, she began to pull move a bit. An adjustment, and then slow pulling away from Star. "I-" Her voice came out raspy, and as she slipped out of Star's arms she would glance back at her, then away quickly. Shame, at what she'd just done. Absolutely breaking down in front of someone - in front of Star - was a shameful thing, in her mind. She'd been raised to be stoic and strong, to stand firm when things went south; and here she was sobbing. Her jaw clenched and unclenched, puffy eyes looking towards the door, then the bathroom. The sadness was still there, the grief. But Ellesandra had finally been able to build up another wall between her and it. It wasn't a mountain, like it was last time; the wall was absolutely transparent. But for a brief break, to maintain her sanity rather than cry for the next few days straight, she'd been able to pull away from the onslaught of feeling, at least a little bit. "Shower." She muttered, feeling gross and icky from all the crying and surely from some of their combined sweat the night before.
Star Lumina	It was natural that Ellesandra would need time. This was a process, not a transaction. It was not as simple as comfort in, happiness out. There were tangled knots of feelings, often conflicting, that needed to be loosened and unwound again. Star was certainly concerned with the suicidal acceptance she felt. It was...Understandable. A weight as heavy as the knight's left its scars, its poisonous, infectious mark. It deeply, deeply troubled Star, but she didn't enter crisis mode upon feeling them only because she knew it was...Subdued. Passive. Dangerous, still, yes, but not active ideation. So when Ellesandra began to pull away, she allowed them to do so, but not without a gentle grasp of their hand before they fully separated. She squeezed their hand, looking at them with deep concern in her eyes. She trusted they were just needing to shower, find their center again. But even if she wasn't going to say it aloud, she was going to be focused on them the whole time to make sure the temperature wasn't scalding them. She also passively made certain that the woman wasn't carrying their weapon with them. "There's nothing to be ashamed about, Ellesandra," she said quietly. She wasn't trying to hold them back from showering of course; she released their hand after the squeeze, signaling them to go on and shower and get comfy. There was a tiny part in the back of her mind that envisioned her joining Ellesandra. Not in a lurid way, but the idea of her being there with the knight, bodies bare and pressed together as the hot water cascaded over them both. A tight hold, a tender washing and cleansing. The sensation of their heartbeats beating against one another. A moment where the rest of the world didn't matter. She hadn't said aloud to Ellesandra how she felt about them; as obvious as it might have been - to her at least - that those budding feelings were mutual, she was waiting for a moment to say them explicitly. A time where Ellesandra wasn't wholly rejecting the idea. But even then, there were...Other things that came before she could even begin to entertain the idea of suggesting such intimate things. So for now, she just let them go, mindful to keep her focus on their aura all the while.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra stopped when Star grabbed her hand. She didn't look at Star, knowing Star could see the shame that was unspoken. Her reassuring her there was nothing to be ashamed of did absolutely nothing to reduce the shame she felt, though. When Star finally released her, she moved to the door of the shower and entered. While, if Ellesandra weren't currently so depressed, she might have invited Star in in other circumstances, the thought didn't even cross her mind right now. She removed her clothes in a robotic like fashion and did any of the prep needed. As they'd just been sleeping recently, her rapier was still beside the bed, so she'd been unarmed - not that she would actually act on the suicide ideation right now. That was the thing about duty. She cared for duty more than herself, in reality, and right now her duty was to protect Star and see her back home to her mother, safely. There would be no attempts at killing herself prior to that duty being completed; despite herself wanting to just not exist anymore, to have died instead of Marigold, and a hundred other ways to look at it, she would substain at least until their mission was through. After that is when the thought was more dangerous. And it was part of this duty that Ellesandra kept the water...not scalding. In fact, it wasn't hot at all. It was freezing cold. This wasn't an attempt to hurt herself in any way - cold water didn't hurt, even if it was uncomfortable. What cold water DID do was shock the system. Ellesandra was trying to get her mind out of the state it was in, to focus her back on their task, to stop wallowing in the shame and guilt and grief that had been following her around for the past three years. There was a moment when her hand reached up to her scar on her right shoulder, pressing in lightly. A tinge of pain came from the sore and weak muscle - though that wasn't the purpose of the press. It was a reminder, as that was the scar that she got as she struck the man who killed Marigold down. Revenge didn't mean anything, really, but there was part of her that took pleasure knowing he didn't still exist, after what he did. The thought almost made her burst into tears again, but she held it back this time. Still not mountain like, but more a barrier so she didn't get overwhelmed again. It would be important that she not let it build back up; she could recognize that, and she doubted Star would let her. Her shower wasn't too long, working to wash her face well and try to ease her puffy, swollen eyes. When she came back out, she was wrapped in a towel that started just over her chest, and went down to mid-thigh. It didn't cover 'much', but covered enough, with another wrapped around her head, and moving to her pack to find new clothes. She didn't look in Star's direction, just moving to grab her clothes. The scars on her back and shoulder were partially visible, and as she grabbed her clothes she reached to drop her towel and put clothes on, then stopped. A moment passed, and then she walked back into the bathroom and closed the door to change. She was personally comfortable changing in front of people, but there was concern for - and an attempt to respect - Star's inexperience in regards to the matter.
Star Lumina	Though the two of them were women and thus had no real surprises waiting for each other for their nudity, Star didn't want their first time being exposed to each other to be anything less than an intimate experience if it was to happen. The future was uncertain in that regard. It might be different if neither of them were romantically interested in other women, but that potential for intimacy certainly changed things in Star's mind, and made her appreciative of Ellesandra taking their privacy. Star had been cautious about the things she felt from Ellesandra while they showered, nearly giving into the desire to check on them when she sensed the pain. But it was fleeting, so she trusted it was caused by some random muscle contraction or lingering pain, not self-inflicted. Minor, all the same. So she stayed put, lost in her own thoughts. When Ellesandra emerged, she smiled at them, and again when they emerged the second time in their change of clothes. Star then quietly took her turn. She needed a shower, too. And assuming Ellesandra had no objections, she would take it and be out again before long with little of consequence to note during. Of course, while she did this, she was still keeping her focus on Ellesandra's presence. Ready to react to an emergency, even if it meant bursting out in the nude to do so. But if all was well, Star emerged with her long, long white hair left to air-dry after removing most of the water from it with her towel. For once, however, she was no longer in that same dress she had been wearing for the entirety of their adventures together. The dress had been sweat on, stained with blood, and sullied with dirt. Yet none of the stains had ever stayed on, it never held any strong scent of body oils accumulated on it, it always looked freshly pressed and sparkling. Though now, it seemed whatever was keeping it as such no longer applied, for Star to be changed out of it. She also didn't carry a pack, and as had been discussed prior, her arcane pocket wasn't available at the moment, so she carefully laid her dress out on top of the dresser, looking uneasy and uncertain for a moment before stepping away from it and letting it be there, flat with gentle inward folds on the skirt to keep it flat on the top of the dresser. The guest clothing was simple, perhaps a little too big. A white button-up, modest top and white pants. Cotton, comfy, but not nearly as brilliant or beautiful as the dress. For the first time, Star looked just...Plain. Though with her pale complexion, white cotton clothes, and long white hair, there was a bit of blending of her hair with the clothing. When it was wet, her hair descended down to her lower calves, a handful of inches from touching the floor with the tips. All the self care handled, Star looked at Ellesandra, uncertain whether to join them on their bed, or move to her own. The desire was naturally to climb into bed with them, cuddle up some more...But she looked to Ellesandra to see how they felt, not wanting to make them uncomfortable with either her presence or absence.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was perfectly okay with Star going to shower - with how she'd sweat while feverish, she was sure that Star needed one to feel clean again. She sat on the corner of the bed, staring at the door to the shower for a moment. There was a bit of appreciation for Star, mixed with the shame, as well as uncertainty. One thing that resulted from all of this was she felt closer to Star, those feelings - even if they had been caged away so they weren't actively being felt - were still there. And they still grew. Having Star just hold her while she sobbed had been a fan to them, that Ellesandra had accepted that and let herself be held by Star like that again. Along with that recognition was fear, trepidation. If she let herself get too close to Star, and if Star died under her watch, Ellesandra wouldn't be able to get past that. Hell, even if she didn't get close to Star and she died, she wasn't sure she could get past it. So with that in mind, did it matter that she grew feelings? Metaphorically, the bars of that cage became a little wider, letting out a little more light - but the cage was still there. Ellesandra wasn't fully accepting them yet. She busied herself around the room, getting her armor back on and strapping her rapier to her waist, the dagger beneath her skirt and the coin pouch to it. Her hair was put back up in it's high ponytail. She was trying to get into work mode, to push down all the feelings from before, but no matter how good a shower it was it couldn't get rid of the red eyes and slight swelling around them. That would just have to go down on it's own. When Star came out in the guest clothes, it made Ellesandra tilt her head to the side and a very small spark of amusement show. "Those clothes look out of place on you, Star. Are you comfortable in them, or should we find a clothing store nearby?"
Star Lumina	Star blushed a tiny bit and looked away, scratching at her cheek. "It is...Entirely possible I forgot to consider the clothing implications when we came here. Though this place doesn't seem to affect my aura or auramancy abilities, well...The magical space I use to store things is pure, typical arcana...Which...Doesn't work here. Or rather, I can't make it work, like they said would happen. S-So, erm...Yes I'm...Not really comfortable in these clothes for anything besides just lounging in the room here." She shuffled a bit in place, embarrassment clearly on her face. "...I don't suppose we might find someone who could clean my dress, as well as find that clothing shop? This dress is er...It's important to me."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched Star, the embarrassment bringing about a need to protect. She almost wanted to hug the auramancer just to protect from the embarrassment. And it was a good distraction from the depression still in the background of her mind. Something to do, to focus on. With a deep breath she moved to stand up, clapping her hands and wiping them as if wiping the entire situation from earlier this morning off of them. Focus on work, time. "Well, why don't we go check with the bartender if they offer a cleaning service, or if we can find one nearby? Along with a clothes shop. I'd go for you and just do all of that but I'm quite certain you don't want me picking out your clothes or you'll be in more of..." She paused, then motioned to her own dirty clothes. Comfortable, but utilitarian. And the day you caught Ellesandra in a dress of any kind was the day you knew you found yourself an imposter.
Star Lumina	Star gave a soft smile. She could see Ellesandra's protectiveness rise up of course. That in itself had been part of what sparked the romantic attraction in her. One thing among many, certainly, but Star could hardly deny how Ellesandra's strong personality and protective nature inspired...Thoughts. The natural consequence of relying on someone else for protection meant a greater ease and comfort with feeling vulnerable. And allowing herself to feel vulnerable around Ellesandra was one of those feelings that fed on itself, wanting to let herself be more vulnerable, open up more to the knight, let herself fall into their arms more, where it was safe. Indeed, she had a moment while listening and looking at Ellesandra that, now that the heavy emotions were at least for the moment behind them both, the more positive emotions were allowed to flutter up in her chest like a swarm of butterflies. Despite the heavy thud in her chest and spreading warmth that came from it, she kept her cool on the outside as much as she could. She wouldn't be able to hide the blush, but that would possibly just get lumped in with the embarrassment. Still...The way Star looked at Ellesandra in that moment was...Different. A look that was indulging some...Thoughts. Some...fantasies. Now wasn't the time, but Star remained a direct foil to Ellesandra in that she still let herself feel it all, rather than lock it away. She giggled at the insinuation. "I ought to get myself some more typical clothes. I'm sure it'll surprise you to hear that I have a tendency to stand out in a crowd and...I probably should try and break that habit. So we can start there, sure. If not them, I'm sure Amelia knows where we'd need to go or who to talk to." Surely Amelia was the go-to because they had a direct line with the coin, and for no other reasons.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't notice the look Star was giving her. Instead she nodded, eyeing Star's clothes again. "Agreed, something to blend in would be great. And something to blend in when we get to your home plain, too. No need for you to stand out and make it easy for Black Diamond or Faust followers to find you." She shook her head though, at the suggestion of going to Amelia. There was a...defensiveness there. Ellesandra didn't actively dislike Amelia, and there was some respect for her skill with magic, but even if Amelia's attitude was a front, Ellesandra wasn't a fan of that. And for someone who had an attitude that didn't exactly make them approachable to request help, and Ellesandra being someone who didn't feel comfortable feeling indebted to someone, it made Ellesandra's desire to ask Amelia for help below zero outside of potentially major circumstances - like what happened with Star passing out. "Well, we'll start with the bartender first. Surely he'll have an idea of local places. Most of them I've met are local experts." It was kind of a bartender's job to know stuff about the local area these days, anyways. She did a mental check to confirm she had everything - including the sending coin, just in case - before she motioned to the door. "Are you ready?"
Star Lumina	Star noticed the small defensiveness at the mention of Amelia. She mentally sighed. The friction there was what had her doing what she did upon their arrival to this place, trying to smooth over the friction before it could be a thing. She understood that wasn't the right way to do it, but she still had mild frustration about it all. Strong heads often butt against one another, even if both of them were total sweethearts at the core. She let the frustration have its moment in her heart, then it quietly dissipated and went on its merry way. She then nodded to Ellesandra's question. "Something tells me I could hide under the biggest rock I could find and it wouldn't stop those villains from finding us if they wanted to," she said with a mild exasperation behind her words. It was rather obvious their foes were powerful beings, at least at the top. Stealth didn't feel like it was going to be the most effective option, but perhaps she would be surprised. The two did leave the room, with Star holding her dress neatly folded over one arm before her. She kept close to Ellesandra, not quite touching but nearly so, shoulder almost brushing against shoulder. A short trip to the bar had Star taking the lead on conversation as she knew Ellesandra preferred. A quick conversation saw the bartender redirecting them to a guild services area that was a bit deeper into the guild hall. Beyond the gathering and mess hall and through some clearly labeled hallways did they reach the services room, which was enough to get them laundry. Star left her dress with them, and the simple price of five copper pieces for the dress was needed from Ellesandra who guarded the money. Normal clothes ran from one to two copper, but luxury items that required special care clearly had a higher maintenance cost. At least, for those who weren't like Star and had some mystic ability to keep the garment looking freshly sewn every day. Laundry was taken care of there, but the guild hall didn't have actual clothes for sale. They had...Armor, certainly. From splint and scale to halfplate to full plate, to shields and weapons and all manner of adventuring equipment, there was quite a bit they could find if they went looking through the wares in the connected shops, but while a full set of plate mail would technically cover Star, it was...A little absurd to imagine the mystic woman in any sort of armor. Comical, even. There certainly were things on offer that would outshine Ellesandra's own equipment - masterworks of armor that would make the knight all the more tenacious in battle, or a new rapier forged of stronger, enchanted metal. The skill in the creation of this equipment was peerless. But with that came an associated price tag - hundreds to thousands of gold pieces at the low end, tens of thousands at the higher end, and surely even more that wasn't for sale en masse. Far outside their budget, though if Ellesandra needed other cheap and common equipment like rope, pitons, a whetstone for their blade, or anything of the sort, it was all available and for better than usual prices. Perks of guild membership, perhaps, though whether they would be permitted to return to this guild hall after they left was anyone's guess. They weren't members, after all, though it seemed that as guests they still had access to its discounted services for now. That all said, actual civilian clothing - that is, not the enchanted robes that were intended for magi that certainly would be fitting for Star - was not really the focus of what the guild offered. Enchanted clothing meant for battle would certainly be more protective for Star, but it was similarly in the realm of hundreds of gold pieces that would, even if they could afford it, would drain nearly all they had to work with for funds, whereas civilian clothes might cost in the range of...Ten or so gold at the higher end, one or two at the lower. But for that, they would have to leave the athenaeum and return to the markets that surrounded it in Myst. But it was Amelia who let them in here - would they be able to return without a member of the guild to let them in? Difficult to say for certain, so Star once more looked to Ellesandra for guidance on what they thought was the best way forward.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was appreciative of Star stepping forward to do the talking again. It meant that Star was feeling better, for one, to take on her role as the 'face' of their little group. It also meant that Ellesandra didn't have to do all the interacting, and she instead took the time to look around the guild hall, taking it in fully again. The times she had been down before to get food and stuff for Star and her while Star recovered, she'd been focused on her task. As they went to pay to get the dress cleaned and stopped by the guild store, Ellesandra did give an appreciative glance at the craftsmanship of the equipment around her. It was obvious whoever did this was particularly skilled, and they had some form of enchanter on staff most likely as well. Though Ellesandra had that stoic look on her face while looking at the weapons and armor, Star would be able to see the appreciation there. In a way, Ellesandra enjoyed window shopping when it came to things like this. No intention of buying anything, but being able to peruse and see quality items was nice. Being faced with the fact that there were no clothes there for Star though, Ellesandra sighed. "Just a moment." Pulling out the sending coin, she'd consider what to say for a second before sending a message to Amelia. Ellesandra spoke out loud, even though she knew she didn't need to, so that Star could at least be part of her side of the conversation. "Apologies for bothering. Star is recovered, looking for a place to get mundane clothes and supplies. If we leave, can we return?"
Star Lumina	The mental message received was clear and concise, only for Ellesandra to hear: 'Not into this hall without someone from the guild to let you in. You are guests. Want me, or Amara?'
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded, considering. She glanced over to Star, remembering how Star had specified reaching out to Amelia - not Amara. She hadn't noticed it before, but being given the option now made her realize the specificity of Star's request. After a moment of consideration, she responded. "Whoever's available, I have no desire to take either of you away from something important. If it's equal, you, and we can wait." Despite her own preference being for Amara, Star hadn't asked to have Amara take them; she'd asked to have Amelia take them. So Ellesandra would relent towards that.
Star Lumina	'Better to not bother the captain, yes. Wait for me in the foyer' was the reply. Star didn't have any real reaction to the conversation, but did smile at Ellesandra for making the conscious effort to include her as best they could. She knew how the Sending spell worked, so could recognize it as a conscious choice on the knight's part. Just another tiny appreciation for their thoughtful efforts.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra took in a deep breath to prepare for interacting with Amelia, but nodded to Star. "Amelia is on her way. She said to meet her in the foyer." It made sense that Amelia wouldn't want to bother the captain, too. Ellesandra should have considered that anyways. Amara was probably busy - not that Amelia wasn't busy too but, either way. She would put the coin back and then begin heading towards the foyer, ensuring that Star was following and didn't stay behind for whatever reason.
Star Lumina	Star kept pace, keeping close to Ellesandra as she had before. Off to the foyer they went, and did indeed have to wait about ten minutes for Amelia to show up. Once they did, greetings were exchanged and the group was able to head off. Back through the portal which appeared to be the only way into this hall, at least from this entrance. Though this time, they appeared near the entrance of the athenaeum, rather than the previously used portal from the library services area. Naturally, they were portals, and this place had been built with freedom for the portals to go to specific places, depending on who it was opening the portal. It made getting around much faster, certainly, as walking from point to point in this place might take hours. Convenient, yes, but more so seemed...Necessary. It would be too much to traverse otherwise. Either way, Amelia seemed to be in a different mood. From her body language to her tone, a lot of her attitude seemed to vanish while around Star. There was some guardedness around Ellesandra still, but it looked more like nervousness. Something was different, as the group headed out to the markets under Amelia's guidance. Some brief talk was had about what sort of clothes Star was looking for, to which she clarified it needn't be anything fancy, but still hopeful for something...Pretty, an admission made with a little flush on her cheeks. They then got into a back and forth talking about specifics to help narrow things down. Naturally, Ellesandra wasn't being ignored, but if the knight was going to remain quiet, then it seemed these two had enough friendly chemistry between them forming to keep the conversation going and leave the knight to their silence.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't notice Amelia's change in mood majorly, or rather that it was specifically around Star that it seemed to vanish. She did seem less prickly, but Ellesandra didn't comment on that. Nor did she really speak much at all, other than greeting Amelia and thanking her for leading them out. Part of her felt bad that they needed to have a guide to come and go, and didn't like the idea of being dependent on Amelia or Amara in that way. Then again, Star seemed to be enjoying herself during the conversation about clothes. Ellesandra didn't interrupt, following through the portal and looking around to keep an eye on their surroundings. While Star had been following close to Ellesandra before, now Ellesandra was doing the same to Star. She followed closer than she had been before, concern with her safety being higher considering how recently she'd been sick. Unless spoken to, she didn't add anything to the conversation though, content to listen and keep an eye out on things, and follow around while they went about finding a good clothes shop for Star. She might pick out a new pair of leggings or two while they were out, considering she'd been struck in the legs a few times in recent fights and they had been torn, but that was all she'd look for for herself, and it would only be if it happened to be convenient where they went - she wouldn't go out of her way for it or bring it up to ask about.
Star Lumina	The quiet from the knight didn't mean Star was ignoring them, certainly. She didn't pressure Ellesandra to get involved in the conversation, but she still made sure to give them a smile in the quiet moments, along with the occasionally touch on their arm. A simple reminder that she was thinking of them. She specifically watched for any discomfort, though assuming she didn't see any she was sure to just keep up the occasional reminder that she wasn't ignoring them. Not that she assumed Ellesandra thought that, but even if the knight was just a friend she'd want to ensure they didn't feel out of place. And as it stood, Ellesandra was now in this weird place where they weren't just a friend, but they also weren't anything more than a friend, in her heart. And not that Ellesandra ever focused on Star's emotions enough to notice, but if today proved to be opposite day for them, there was a matched feeling in Star's heart to what Ellesandra felt and then caged up. Star of course never caged her feelings like that, but it was also too subtle to push through that barrier between emotions the two maintained when things were calm. So unless Ellesandra flipped their own script, it was a normal, mundane couple hours of shopping. A few different shops were visited on different discs of settlement, with the occasional sight of one of the towering automatons just doing their patrols. It was peaceful and boring, but that was exactly what made for a safe place. Safe enough that shop owners could abandon their shops for lunch and leave things unattended - a thief wasn't above the watchful gaze of the scrying eyes of Myst, after all. It seemed the people of Myst knew quite well how bad of an idea it was to try and get away with even petty crime just because nobody was actively looking at them. A more thorough trek through the city revealed more variation in the species of people. Some had tails, some had horns, some scales, some had bright midnight-toned skin, others a pallid white, and even a few greenskinned half-orcs here and there. It was a melting pot of cultures and people from human to dragonborn to halfling to tiefling to tabaxi to all other sorts. There was even an aarakocra flying briefly overhead at one point, and the purveyor of the shop that ultimately had a nice set of blue clothes that caught Star's eye was an air genasi woman who moved about the shop by briefly turning to a gust of air that shot over to where she wanted to be and then reformed in her mostly human-like figure, though the curvy leylines of cerulean mana on her face made her elemental heritage clear even without the whole turning-into-air thing. The shop owner was proud of her work, as was typical of genasi folk, though it wasn't without merit. Even the less flamboyant outfits were made with care and precision that did well to accent the feminine form. The shop owner talked up their dresses, which were flashy and opulent with gems and filigree, though the prices for those were quite a bit more than what Star and Ellesandra were looking to spend. And were also contrary to the goal of being LESS standout. Star naturally handled the situation well, mixing in praise for the garment while redirecting seamlessly to her actual desired purchase. The leggings that Ellesandra had been keeping an eye out for were also proudly on display here, though the leggings for sale here were very much less utilitarian and more feminine, with accent on the lace at the rim of the leggings and made of a shapely fabric that hugged and ever so gently pinched the thighs. And alongside those leggings were, well...Night wear of the intimate persuasion, from sheer negligee tops to flirty and evocative panties. The leggings were tight, so they would serve the purpose, and they came in either black or white, but it then came to Ellesandra to decide if they wanted - or could tolerate - something more flashy, or if it was better to find a way to repair the ones they already had.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra offered Star a smile here and there when she reached back to touch her and remind her of her being accepted into the conversation, should she have wanted it. She still remained quiet, certainly not digging into Star's emotions at all, and using the time to both keep an eye out and familiarize herself with some of moving about Myst. It would take a while before she felt comfortable travelling here but after practice she was sure she'd be able to; the only issue being that she'd still have to rely on Amelia or Amara in order to get back into the guild hall. Perhaps they could find somewhere else to stay? If needed they could, but she doubted Star would want to potentially insult the two by making the request. Being on guard duty helped her push her feelings from this morning down. To properly build that wall again, not just translucent. Oh, it wasn't the mountain it was before; the grief and loneliness and guilt were all still there, but they were acknowledged then ignored. Before, Ellesandra was simply pretending they didn't exist, forcing them down so far she could go about life without them interacting with her at all. Now, they were always there, in the background. She'd see a dress while following along for the shopping that would send a jolt of pain through her, reminding her of Marigold, or she'd glance someone travelling by with red hair and her attention would snag on it for a moment before disappointment bubbling up. Small things, natural things when healing from a loss. Things she hadn't let herself do before. Naturally, she knew Star would see these. If Star ever looked about to ask or comment on anything that bubbled up, Ellesandra would shake her head silently and offer her a brief smile to reassure her that everything was alright. Well, 'alright'. When she did find the leggings that she'd been looking for, she very quickly passed them up. Sure, they would work, but she was not about to wear something that would draw more attention to herself either. They weren't her style, nor did she desire to have to deal with the comments from Star or Amelia, or even Amara, at seeing her in them. The lingerie was completely ignored; if she had a place to call home, a place to settle down and someone to do that with, she would have given those pieces more attention. However, she wasn't about to carry lingerie around in her pack when the only romps she had were with random women and nonbinary people around a tavern when between jobs. And she was still in denial in regards to her and Star, even if things kept growing between them.
Star Lumina	Star did a bit more talking with the genasi owner of the shop before settling on some plain clothes. But a little more discussion went on, and whether it was something about Star herself, or the way she had been speaking to the genasi and playing into their natural pride of their work with her praise and general sweetness, it came to be that the owner of the shop began to insist on Star taking a flashier garment with them as well. Not for free of course, but a good deal was offered for the common clothes and what was not a full on gown like Star's other dress, but was still pretty, still dressy, with a flared skirt and an exposed back. A garment that was, according to the shop keeper, enchanted with air magic that allowed the wearer to be fleet of foot and be carried by the winds. Something that certainly was worth a few hundred gold pieces for its magic alone, but offered to be bought along with the common clothes for just fifty gold. Amelia, who had been vaguely involved in the conversation, looked a little jealous about the offer, but kept a lid on her frumpy body language. Star wasn't expecting to part with that much, so she looked at Ellesandra with a bit of a blush on her cheeks. The tactical use was obvious: either to get to Ellesandra in a moment of need, or perhaps more importantly to the knight, the ability for Star to get away from danger with that burst of speed the garment promised. The difficult matter was that their money was not infinite, and though they were spared lodging costs, the food costs were taking little by little from their savings. Any purchases they made would have to potentially require the two of them do work somewhere to make up the cost and keep them afloat as they progressed towards their goal. Star wasn't going to make the decision alone however, so, she asked plainly: "What do you think, Ellesandra?"
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched the air genasi and Star converse, seeing the interest in Star even as they began talking about the magical skirt. Once Star looked at her, before even speaking up, Ellesandra was reaching for the coin pouch and pulling it out. She set it in Star's hand to count out the coin and pay; Ellesandra considered it Star's money in all honesty, and they'd been given a good amount of it by Morrun. Plenty enough to get a splurge item and be mindful of food spending and such. Her answer was unspoken, but she did add verbally - "A good deal on an item that will help to keep you safe, Star. I see no harm in that." Plus, there was a small bit inside of her that wanted to see Star happy and get something for herself she enjoyed. Ellesandra would never admit to that, but there had been no mistaking a certain...enjoyment of watching Star shop, being able to just forget about her stresses for a little, chat with Amelia and find something nice to wear other than the one dress she had. Ellesandra was careful with money and planning, but they'd been given enough that their padding would be alright as long as they didn't splurge on anything else, and were mindful not to get the most expensive foods and drinks.
Star Lumina	In total the expenditures between food and lodging thus far, plus the fifty gold they had just spent, left just over four-hundred gold pieces left in their coffers. That, plus whatever Ellesandra and Star had prior to their payday. Still more than enough to keep them going for a long time if they were mindful of costs. Star did light up in the eyes when the go-ahead was given. Not that either one of them made the decision alone, at least in Star's mind, but it also was that she wouldn't do so without confirming with her companion. And if the two ever got playfully up in arms about whose gold it was, Star was sure to remind Ellesandra how it was technically the knight's gold, just 'donated' to the mutual adventure fund, which was, as far as Star was concerned, a bunch of nonsense. The semantics didn't truly matter to her though, only that she and Ellesandra were on the same page. So with that all done, what followed was an insistence from the proprietor of the shop that Star try it on, mostly so the shop keep could see their creation on the new owner. Once more, a satisfaction of genasi artisanal pride. Something Star couldn't really refuse, so she was ushered into a change room after leaving her new common clothes with Ellesandra to hold. The fitting room was just a small side room in the shop, Ellesandra would be able to see it was just one way in and out, which was the door they were all near, and had just a bench and a mirror and a hook to hang the clothes. Star was obviously going in alone, but any strange noises would be able to have Ellesandra rip the door open and spring into action easily enough. Still, Star imagined there'd be a little paranoia from her dutiful protector, so she was certain to give them a reassuring look before going in. A short minute or two passed before she emerged again, having put her hair up into a long ponytail while in the change room as the garment came with a decorative hair ornament that would be wasted otherwise. When she stepped back out, she did a little twirl, then immediately blushed for having done so, and looked most specifically at Ellesandra for their reaction to her new outfit. Not really the step down in flash they had been looking for, but it was at least...slightly less so than her poofy, feathery dress. "S-So uhm...How do I look?"
Ellesandra	They could probably argue and butt heads over the coin every day during meals and never come to being on entirely the same page of it. Ellesandra didn't mind though, as Star paid and began moving to try it on. Ellesandra would take the coin purse back after the payment was complete to place back where it was, then eyed the changing room. Star was absolutely right that Ellesandra was paranoid, and she almost insisted on going inside with Star, but held back that bit. Instead she watched it and considered where it would let out to on the outside if it did, as well as how long she would give Star. She listened intently while Star was inside, the more common clothes thrown over one arm and glancing over at Amelia briefly, though she didn't speak up to her. When Star came back out and asked how she looked - well. Ellesandra's face remained mostly stoic, only her eyebrows raising as she looked Star over. To the outside, she looked amused at Star's nervousness at asking. Star would be able to see attraction though, firmly behind the motivation of Ellesandra's gaze up and down her. She took a moment to answer, working to not make that so obvious in her voice and wet her lips before she answered - "Like you'll stand out in a crowd from a mile away. But it fits you, and as you said our enemies are likely to find us anyways." A reassuring smile was given before she nodded. She knew Star would have been able to see the attraction, and knew that part of it need not be said. Was she beginning to rely on Star seeing her emotions to not say the hard things, or the awkward things? That thought surprised her, but she pushed it away for now. No need to worry about that right now, anyways.
Star Lumina	Star naturally saw the attraction. If she wasn't who she was, didn't have the power she had, she might have found Ellesandra's response to be a little disappointing. On the surface, it was. She was nervous, wanting reassurance about how she looked, and 'you stand out' and 'it fits' were not really the words she wanted to hear. But that wasn't the story. Ellesandra knew what Star could see, and Ellesandra didn't seem to be actively trying to hide that feeling. It said to her that they wanted her to see it. And she saw it. And it deepend her blush significantly. Her hands folded behind her and she had a...Moment. A moment of looking at Ellesandra. Their attraction was felt, and it made her want to...Be prettier in their eyes. Strike a cute pose. Indulge their attraction and fan that flame. Her heart wanted Ellesandra to...want her. Her chest fluttered and one leg twisted just slightly to push her knee into the other knee, then gently tapped the tip of her toe against the floor a few times. A nervous little gesture that told the tale of where her mind was going. But not only were they in public, they also were in an uncertain place together. She couldn't help how she felt, she wouldn't want to repress her emotions regardless. But she at least was kept from that feeling becoming anything more than just a feeling by the other factors. Her heart was just going to...Be a little quicker for a bit. The genasi owner was beside themselves, swelling with pride at the beauty of it all. Amelia looked...Genuinely happy for Star, and made heart-hands at Star to show her thoughts on the matter. Ellesandra would get their wish. A little moment for Star to just...Be happy. Forget her troubles. Have a little spotlight for a moment and truly uplift her. With business concluded, the group was clear to head out again, though Star was still a little dazed, and Amelia was more or less just following the other two around until it was time to head back.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched as Star looked nervous, shy, and...happy. The little motions, the leg twisting, the knees - it was enough that Ellesandra couldn't actually stop the small smile that tugged at the corner of her lips. Through the stoicness, the smile broke out, though Star could see the...well, it wasn't so much 'joy' as happiness and excitement at seeing Star happy like that. Part of her wanted to step up and hug Star, to spin her around and make the skirt go spinny like they were dancing or something. She did not, though. While Star let her feelings for Ellesandra be felt, Ellesandra did not. They existed, right on the edge of her periphery, caged and growing within it, but not felt. Attraction was entirely separate from those romantic feelings, and one that Ellesandra let herself feel. Attraction was something she experienced for many people occasionally, and it had nothing to do with emotions. And Ellesandra was not going to admit how those emotions she had for Star only fueled and flamed the attraction; how the same outfit on Amelia wouldn't have drawn nearly the same reaction. So, she just smiled softly while Star received the attention and applause for looking great in the skirt, and followed out as they finished their shopping. She stopped, turning to look between Amelia and Star. She was torn between wanting to see Star out and about and happy, not wanting to inconvenience Amelia any more, and also wanting to go on with their mission to get information on Star's home plane and how to access it. They'd already wasted essentially two days with the combination of Star's sickness and Ellesandra's emotional mess of a self. "Where to, or back to the guild? I'd at least like to stop by the library and ask Serenity for any updates, if that would be okay Amelia." She could leave it open, let Star choose if there was somewhere else she wanted to go before then.
Star Lumina	Star couldn't deny her own desire to get back to the mission. As much as she enjoyed this moment of being allowed to feel pretty and cute, how she found a tasteful appreciation in the asymmetry of one leg having a legging and the other not, and generally just feeling happy for having a new, pretty outfit that was enough to get even Ellesandra to look at her amorously, she couldn't let all of that distract from the reality that her mother was still trapped, still possibly suffering. She had the guest clothes folded over one arm, having briefly stepped back to retrieve them before exiting. She wouldn't stop Ellesandra from taking them if they pushed to do so, but also wouldn't foist it upon them. Something to return to the guild hall. But aside from having to wait until her dress was done being laundered, the only thing stopping them from going ahead was the actual process of finding how to get back to Gurhal. Given this was the city of gates, or so was its reputation, Star didn't imagine it would be too hard. And there was no reason she needed to just pause everything to focus on Ellesandra's needs, too. Whether they were in the safety of Myst or out in the wilds together, she could still...Talk to Ellesandra. And there was much to talk about, though it would probably be easier to get them to feel comfortable enough to cry when in a safe room like they had been, not having to worry about making excess noise and attracting attention. All that in mind, Star nodded. "I'd like to pick up the materials and get to studying them, then head back to our room." Amelia nodded. "No trouble, I'm still on rest. I'm fine again, plenty recovered from expending my mana, but captain is paranoid like that. There's no pressing mission for the First Crusaders right now, so that's code for captain to tell us all to sit around and rest while we can," said Amelia with a casual shrug. "So right now I'd just be reading. Getting a little time in the sun and stretching my legs isn't so bad, and you got a total steal out of it. Just make sure to test its effect once you actually leave Myst, yeah? Not that it happens often, but some merchants have tried to swindle people by claiming something is magic, but you can't test it here because of the dampening field - which is true - only for them to leave and find it's just mundane. That genasi has been here for a while so I trust they're being honest, and they're magical enough to do what they say, but still worth it even if just to know how it works," explained Amelia, showing some good pragmatism that was mostly free of her typical attitude. Maybe the rest had been good for her? She had certainly been more mellow. Aside from maybe finding Amara a little overly cautious, the bratty girl Ellesandra knew was nowhere to be found. "If you want another set of eyes, o-or something, I might as well do something useful and help you, i-if, like, you want that, or...something. Might be a lot of books to sort through.." And now Amelia was...blushing? Arms folded, looking away from her companions at some interesting patch of wall on the building to her side. Star smiled a big, knowing smile. Obviously she could see right through Amelia's nervous little show and could see how much they wanted to keep the company - it didn't take an auramancer's eyes to see as much - but Star still looked at Ellesandra. They were the one who had friction with the other woman, so Star let them answer. Help was nice, but she didn't want Ellesandra to feel annoyed at all for it.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded to what Star said, then looked over at Amelia as she suggested caution. Ellesandra would have considered that normally, but she had begun to feel accustomed to Star's power. She hadn't even questioned if the woman had been lying; Star had trusted her, and therefore she likely wasn't lying. When she brought up potentially helping, or offering to help anyways, and then....blushing? She paused, watching Amelia, then looking over at Star. Suspicion and a very, very small spark of jealousy. It was small because she never pretended to lay claim on Star in any way, and Ellesandra didn't even recognize it as jealousy, but there was just something that felt off about the idea of if Amelia liked Star. Of course, Ellesandra wasn't certain that was the cause, either. It could very well be that Amelia was just trying to learn more about Star and her magic; she had been quite interested in it when Ellesandra had explained some of it. And perhaps the blushing was just admitting her ignorance? She seemed to enjoy knowing things other's didn't, and priding herself on that. When Star looked at her to confirm, she nodded. "I see no issue as long as Star is comfortable with it. I certainly won't be much help; words on paper tend to scramble together in my brain a lot. One of the reasons I never really spent much time in studies as a child." She'd quickly found her niche with Sia, and her foster 'parents' had forced her to do just enough learning that she wouldn't embarrass them, but that was it.
Star Lumina	Star tilted her head gently at Ellesandra's admission of dyslexia. "Oh? Hm," Star said, taking that and keeping it neatly tucked in memory. She would be sure to do any sort of study that was needed. Amelia gave a more direct look at Ellesandra, recognizing the symptom but...Not feeling it was her place to say 'hey, you probably are dyslexic', not least of all because...What would it change? Putting a label on it didn't change Ellesandra's experience of it. Star was more committed to ensuring that she support Ellesandra in it, naturally. "Of course I have no issue with you joining. You're welcome among us, Amelia," said Star, smiling. With that decided, their path forward was clear. If this was a case of Amelia having attraction to Star, Star certainly wasn't reacting to it the same way she did when Ellesandra's interest sparked. Star did say nobody before Ellesandra had shown actual, genuine romantic interest in her, which was the truth, which also meant if it was just a physical attraction that was seen, it likely meant nothing to Star. Or maybe Star was just doing well to hide what she saw? Maybe she was trying to make herself less 'readable' in that regard so Ellesandra wouldn't inadvertently breach consent of another sharing information through such intuition? It was a complicated situation, one leaving more questions than answered about the emotions in play. But, it seemed the night ahead of them would be one spent in study while Ellesandra did...Whatever Ellesandra would do while they studied. "Oh, though if you don't really feel like studying with us, I'm sure captain still wants to talk to you about...Whatever it was they wanted to talk about." Annnd there came the jealous glance away from Star, clearly trying not to let it show...
Ellesandra	Ellesandra wasn't ashamed of her inability to read well, even if she didn't know the cause. She could read, and that was more than some people. She also never claimed to be well studied. It didn't mean she wasn't intelligent, either. She was good in class, about averagely anyways, when it was simply spoken lesson. It was only when she had to write or read that she struggled in them. She would begin to follow along, shaking her head at Amelia's offer. She, still, didn't seem to notice the jealousy from Star regarding Amara, and didn't put her odd look together with the jealousy she'd felt during the aura cleansing that had been done. "I don't think so, not unless the captain decides she wants to take a trip down to the archives with us. I don't mind standing around while you two study; it was part of my training how to entertain myself while keeping guard, so don't mind me. At the very least, the architecture and design of the building is interesting and will keep me distracted for a bit, but I'm not unused to extremely boring guard duties." Unspoken was that she wasn't going to leave Star alone there, even if she was alone with Amelia. Amara was welcome to join them and they could sit away so they didn't disturb Star or Amelia, but Ellesandra wasn't about to go off and have a chat with Amara while Star was in a different place studying.
Star Lumina	Amelia rose a brow at the answer, but ultimately just shrugged. Star tilted her head. "Oh. I thought we were going to bring the materials to our room?" She asked aloud, thoughtfully tapping the corner of her mouth with an extended index finger. "As long as you remain on athenaeum grounds the books can be brought anywhere. The guild services desk accepts book returns," explained Amelia as she began walking back to the athenaeum. They could figure out the logistics while heading back. "I wouldn't want you to be bored, Ellesandra. Not without just cause anyway," said Star. It being normal for the knight didn't mean she enjoyed it, and she still had a lot more trust in Myst in general than Ellesandra did. She understood that it was a source of comfort for them to remain near her of course, and she certainly wasn't going to deny them that, nor the chance to be close to them regardless. The thought of laying on Ellesandra, cuddling up while she studied the material crossed her mind. It made her heart flutter again. Not a thing she could do with Amelia in the room as well, however. "Could always pick a spot to study in the training grounds if you wanted to watch some sparring or magic duels. Always good entertainment that can teach a thing or two by observation. Can be a tad noisy though," suggested Amelia. Decisions, decisions..
Ellesandra	Oh. Ellesandra had assumed they would find some secluded table in this library and just do their work there. Realizing they would be bringing the books back to the room, she considered. She could theoretically spend time in the main guild area, but there was always a risk someone would come to the room without her there. It wasn't like she was going to post up at the door or anything, but she still didn't know that she felt comfortable leaving Star alone like that. The comment about studying in the training grounds did elicit interest in Ellesandra, just like it had when Amara had mentioned potentially finding someone to spar with there when they'd first entered. A small modicum of excitement and interest, but after a moment of consideration Ellesandra shook her head to the idea. "That would be too distracting, I'm sure." Not just distracting noise wise, but distracting for Star having to see all of the different aura's while trying to focus on the books. She wasn't sure what it was like in public places, but since it wasn't something she could just turn off, Ellesandra was almost sure that it would be distracting if there were people around like that. "Don't worry, though. I've brought some wood in my pack, and can spend the time whittling away. I'll be fine." This was added mostly for Star's benefit, as she was the one who indicated that she didn't want Ellesandra to be bored unnecessarily. "And if it gets too bad, I can help with the books." It would just take longer, and make her head hurt. But she could help.
Star Lumina	There was only so much Star could bear to watch Ellesandra get excited and then just...Throw it all away. That tolerance grew samller by the day, in part because it itself wore upon her heart to see such consistently abandoned excitement or positive feelings, and in part because her budding romantic feelings for Ellesandra made every negative thing that much more unbearable to watch. So came a resurgence of a more...Stubborn look on Star's face. "It would hardly be distracting. And depending on what sort of things there are to see, I might learn something useful in watching such displays," said Star with a crossing of her arms. She spoke true, but it was absolutely correct to assume a large part of her decision was based on seeing Ellesandra excited. And after Ellesandra had lifted her up so much just minutes ago, there was a definite air that Star was ready to fight about this seemingly mundane topic. It was about so much more than just where to study. "I'm sure Amelia and I can more than handle this study project, not that you aren't welcome to help too if you want. But best pick a place that enriches us all, no?" asked Star. Amelia smirked. "I think I'll uh, just let you two figure out the 'where', then." Amelia didn't say it, but she could see a lover's quarrel for what she believed it to be.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra frowned at Star, unsure why she was suddenly suggesting that. She seemed ready to fight on this topic. It took her a moment to realize that Star probably saw the interest Ellesandra had felt in that and she took a deep breath, closing her eyes. Was that going to happen everytime she was interested in something, but put it to the side for the betterment of their mission? She thought back to when she'd felt it before and remembered Star blowing her cheeks out - frustration? There was real consideration whether she should argue against this, but eventually she shrugged. "Training pitch it is, then. To be clear though, I'm not going to be partaking. Can't really guard you when I'm distracted by an opponent or training exercises." And a training pitch was arguably more dangerous than a library, considering it was possible some form of attack got off track and could go in their direction without it even being hostile intent. That seemed like a good compromise for Star, yeah?
Star Lumina	Compromise wasn't so much how it seemed to be received. Star smiled. Her arms stayed crossed but there was an immediate lightening to her posture. No longer rigid, she visibly relaxed. Seemed like she got everything she wanted. In truth, she still wanted Ellesandra next to her, so them going and practicing wasn't her desire. That was more something she would happily watch them do, but more felt that was their choice. "Glad we're in agreement. I won't complain if you change your mind and want to partake, but I'm happy keeping you sitting with me." Not quite as bold of an admission as she wanted to make but...There were better times to flat out say she was halfway to thinking about all this as a date. It wasn't, not least of all because of the furry-eared third wheel, but that didn't stop her hopelessly romantic heart from enjoying the idea anyway. With that settled, they would still have to go to the library service desk first to speak to Serenity. A trip that would be uneventful unless Ellesandra had more on the subject.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had expected Star to push for her to stay busy, or do something on the training grounds. Her mind went back to Star suggesting training as a way of processing emotions, but the comment of her being happy to keep Ellesandra sitting with her made her tilt her head in confusion. That...kind of came off as flirtatious, even if it wasn't actively flirting. She glanced over to Amelia, as if trying to get confirmation of how she'd interpreted that, before back to Star. "I...okay." She was unsure how to proceed with this. She was still firmly in the 'nothing can happen between us' camp, even if those feelings were growing. They were still locked away for a reason; just because Ellesandra had cried her heart out onto Star earlier that day did not mean she was ready to let Star into her heart. There was still healing that needed to be done, and Ellesandra still needed to admit to herself how much those feelings were growing. Either way, she would nod and agree to this, and was mostly quiet and thoughtful while they were speaking to Serenity to get the books. The only thing Ellesandra added as to thank Serenity for her bringing the book the previous night, as it had, in fact, given her a lead on how to help. Beyond that, she was in typical guard, following quietly duty.
Star Lumina	Star certainly wasn't flirting. She wasn't pushing what she knew would take time. She WANTED to flirt. She want to do a lot more. She had building, exciting feelings in her heart that filled her head with fantasies of her and Ellesandra, things that made her heart race and her breath feel like it was being sucked from her chest. She did not reject these feelings. She let herself feel it all, let herself desire Ellesandra. But she did not let those emotions blind her to the very real and present need for Ellesandra to heal, before anything else. Her feelings might lead nowhere. Her feelings might lead to later disappointment and loneliness. But no amount of pain that might come from later rejection would make her deny what she felt. And ultimately, her desire in the moment, the stubbornness on insisting they study where they were to study, was largely unrelated to her romantic interest. No, that was just a giant pouty face that crossed its arms in her heart and said to Ellesandra: 'be happy, damnit'. Amelia met Ellesandra's glance, but Amelia's face revealed nothing. A little stone faced on the matter. Not even an acknowledging shrug. The group detoured to the guest lodging in the guild hall first to deposit Star's extra clothes so they needn't be carried everywhere. The group arrived at Serenity's office swiftly after their detour, finding there was a pile of a dozen books that had been set aside for them. The thanks were met with a warm and tender smile from the librarian, and general happiness that she had been of help and service. Truly, that was what gave her vocation purpose and meaning. Enrichment of others and helping all those who came to Myst have a better life, through the power of the written word. The books were naturally split around the group, four for each to carry. Most of them seemed to be journals, first-hand accounts, transcribed again onto identically bound books that could only be told apart by their strictly logical titles, though one was titled 'The War of the Dark Curtain', which if studied proved to be a retelling of many details of that same war Ellesandra had heard about being significant to Gurhal. Amelia looked quite surprised that there was so little material on the subject, though remarked that it was surely natural that some planes eluded the mission of the Followers of Myst to gather information. There were only so many guild members, after all. Perhaps in another thousand years, the archives would come to encompass every civilized plane. Regardless of future prospects, the current moment saw the group arriving at the training grounds. And while Ellesandra might be expecting a muddy pit with straw dummies, what they instead came to find would be a series of academic lecture halls, at least in terms of the initial impressions. Certainly, there were more open-air training grounds that were more free-form, but for the purpose of them simply observing and studying at the same time, these were where Amelia led them. The halls had wooden seats behind wooden desks that one would expect of a lecture hall, though they overlooked a wider staging area. Instead of slate and chalk and a podium, there were racks of weapons, magical tools and assorted things, and an open area. There was a magical barrier between the observation stands and the training ground proper, something Ellesandra might notice by the faint magical sparkles that rest in the corners where the supporting wooden pillars met the overhanging ceiling, clearly dividing the observing area and the staging grounds for whatever training was going to happen. There were others present in this chamber, and the hallway they walked through that had the door which entered into this space was one of many, suggesting there were quite a few more training rooms just like this one that people could move between if they wanted to see what else was going on in the different spaces. The one they walked into was chosen mostly by way of it being closest to them. The clash of metal on metal could be heard as soon as they walked in; two men in full plate practiced with dulled swords that had flat points on them, but were still very much made of metal. Longsword fighting, it seemed. The two armored men were overseen by another man with a scruff beard in more ornate plate mail who stood in gruff observation. Just swords, no shields. There was a gallery of eight other figures without helmets but still in plate mail that stood in the lower arena off to the side, observing what were presumably fellow students. Star and Amelia shuffled through the wooden stands to find a seat that allowed the three of them to sit together, Amelia on one end, Star in the middle, Ellesandra on the other. Whether it was chance or something Amelia did intentionally, the group was positioned such that to Ellesandra's left was one of the intersecting vertical stairs that allowed observers to ascend and descend the lines of wooden seats. Something that ensured nobody
Star Lumina	could sit beside Ellesandra, and gave Ellesandra quick exit and ability to pull Star with them if needed. Not that it'd be needed, but Amelia may or may not have picked up on the knight's paranoid behaviours. Once they were seated, the two girls picked a book each and began into their studies. The swordfight practice continued until one egregious error was made by the man on the left. An over-committed overhand that telegraphed far too heavily when the other was still on guard. This earned the man on the left a swift pommel strike into the front face of his helm, which knocked him off balance and onto his ass with an expected grunt of pain. The observing master then stepped in. "Ahh, Bathus, what in Bahamut's name was that, eh?" he asked, moving to grab the man, Balthus, by the arm and yank him back up to his feet. "Been reading too many fiction books on heroes who go in for final blows before earning them, 'ave you?" He then roughly shoved Balthus back towards the group of other students. "Do me a favour, you lot, take yourselves back to the pits and don't let Balthus here have his dinner until he's practiced the regiment of guard breaks a thousand times. And the next time I catch any of you tryin' to pull any heroic shit as that, it's a hundred pushups and twenty laps in full plate, and double that the next time. An' if I hear a word of bitching, you're all doing drills in yer' skivvies for a week. These blades'r dull, yeah, but they're still leave ya' more purple than an eggplant fer it, so get outta my sight!" he barked, earning attention from the students, who then moved off as commanded. There was then a pause, as it seemed there was a changing of who would be using the space, with some more people moving in and out to make adjustments to what equipment was available.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra followed along, dropping off the bought clothes nicely on one of the bed and then following along to the library, tucking the books she was given beneath her left arm without really looking at them much. She followed along to the training area next, focused on mapping out the direction and location in her mind so that if she ever needed to navigate these halls without Amelia or Amara, she might be able to - at least a little. When they got there, her eyes were peeled for any potential trouble, taking in what might be natural risks, but seeing that there was some sort of magical barrier between them and the actual training ground was a little reassuring. Sure, that didn't mean something couldn't still hurt them from there, but that there was something there for protection was nice. Whether it was intentional or unintentional, Ellesandra did appreciate Amelia leaving her on the end, and even more so that it was her left side. She assumed that bit was unintentional, though maybe Amelia had noticed her fighting with mostly her left hand, or had done that because of Ellesandra's injury to her right arm during the fight. Either way, she would sit the books down nearby lightly and ensure that both Amelia and Star were comfortable, one hand coming out to lightly brush Star's shoulder in a gentle comforting motion. She wasn't sure how Star's emotions might be with actively continuing their mission right now, but if she was feeling nervous or anxious or anything about her mother with the refocus on this, Ellesandra wanted to reassure her. The touch didn't last long, simply a fleeting reassurance before Ellesandra took in their surroundings again, and then turned her focus down onto the training pitch. This was just in time to see one of the knights overextend, which resulted in the expected punishment of that. Her eyes flicked between both knights, then the others down in the training ground, listening as their trainer or commander - she wasn't sure the relation there - scolded them. It set up in her a feeling of...nostalgia. Positive nostalgia, a feeling like this was something close to 'home' for her. Obviously she'd never been to Myst, but no matter where you were you had places like this, and the training yard was where she had spent so much of her time growing up. So needless to say, she was quite comfortable to just sit, appreciate and enjoy the ambience while watching for whoever would be coming in for the next training. She did keep glancing around up in the stands, just a casual sweep of her gaze, to not forget that she was on guard duty, but otherwise she watched the grounds.
Star Lumina	Star smiled at the reassurance, letting her eyes linger on Ellesandra for a moment just to give them the warmth of her smile and appreciation for their thoughtfulness. Perhaps even more so now that there had been the spark of romance between them, Star had nothing but positivity to pour into her companion's presence when they were being kind and thoughtful towards her, shared with smiles and sweetness behind those sparkling blue eyes of hers. She did have work to focus on, and she did so, but every so often she might just gently lean her head on Ellesandra's armored shoulder for a few minutes, or lean against them a little, or just turn to look and make sure the knight was still content. She could see the nostalgia in them. The positive emotion. The familiarity of it all. It reaffirmed to her that she made the right choice in insisting on this. It wasn't for her. She could only imagine herself on the receiving end of such scolding and just turning into a blubbering, sobbing mess for disappointing her trainer like that. She was too sensitive for that life. But Ellesandra liked being here, and being near Ellesandra while they had a chance to just be happy for a while did a lot for Star, too. It helped her find her center. It helped her breathe easy. Some chatter came about while Star and Amelia studied, the two idly discussing some things they found in the books that were notable. Early conjecture, nothing of particular substance, but affirmation that accepting Amelia's help was a boon. Star and Amelia were clearly able to commiserate on arcana, though listening close it would be clear that Amelia did know more than Star about the subject. Still, Amelia didn't speak with superiority on it. In fact, Amelia looked delighted to be talking about it, and in helping Star in general. A sweetness to Amelia that had been hiding under the bratty exterior showed itself around Star. As the two did their study, the next occupants moved in. A group of staffers using magic floated in what was clearly a piste, though it had more than the typical fencing markings on it. The fencing markers were there of course, identifiable in white lines across the piste, but there were also red marker lines, and blue marker lines. A multi-purpose platform for duels of various sorts, it seemed. A host of figures poured into the training area. The group was led by one man, one woman. The man had black hair and a long, black coat, leather gloves, and carried a golden staff etched with runes in his right hand, which was long enough to tap the butt on the ground with each step. The woman had wavy brown hair and wore a set of feminine robes with a dark, sleek, silk cloak that draped over her shoulders. There was a gathering of students falling in line behind them. Amelia's eyes widened when she looked up. "Wow...Professor Yami, and professor Chamberlain?" she mumbled to herself. Teachers, it seemed, though that seemed obvious enough. "Right," began the man, tapping his staff twice on the wooden floor. "Reiterating for all of you students, and for our esteemed observants," he said, briefly looking up at the stands and making a motion with one gloved hand at the audience before lowering it again to address the students more directly. "Today we'll be doing practice examinations. These won't count for marks, but you should be treating this as though they do. Professor Chamberlain is here to observe and officiate, and will be giving you a mock grade. Once you've all had a turn at the mock exam for spell dueling, there'll be some recreational fencing if you wish to partake with whatever time we have left," explained the man. The woman professor then shot a hand up, sporting a wholesome and adorable smile. "I'll be fencing, but I suck, so now's your chance to get revenge on big bad teach for all the alchemy homework she assigned you!" said the woman, evoking a round of chuckles from the students and the male professor. The man pat the woman on the back a few times. "Ah, don't be modest, I'm sure you've improved. You're certainly better than me at it, yes?" he asked, earning a sarcastic quip from the woman in turn: "Professor Yami, I'm still not convinced you've worked out which end of the rapier goes towards the enemy. In fact, I'm certain you took one look at the thing, said 'this blasted hunk of metal can't cast spells'," she said with a mocking impression of the man. "And then cast it into your magical forge to melt it down for its base metal to form back into a necklace of fireballs or something," she said, sporting a cheeky smile. "So beating you hardly counts." Another few chuckles. Professor Yami included. "All right, all right, enough joking, professor Chamberlain," he responded, moving to step onto the piste on one end. "Let's not waste time. Come, first up, let's see what you've learned." Professor Yami stood casually behind one of the blue markers on the piste, with one of the students, who sported an oak staff with a purple crystal
Star Lumina	sphere at the top, moving up to take position opposite him on the opposing blue marker. "When you're ready, Sevra," said professor Yami. Sevra, the woman who stood opposite him, took a moment to concentrate, then thrust her staff forward, hurling a purple bolt of mana at professor Yami, who responded by thrusting his hand that held his staff forward, keeping the staff vertical, to produce a magical wall of force that impacted the bolt and dissipated it. He then twisted his wrist and flung the tip of his golden staff in a downward arc that produced a series of eight blue bolts that shot back at thrice the speed of the student, catching them off guard as they attempted to mimic his action in producing something to stop the bolts, but failing as the bolts hit her across her shoulder, torso, and hip. Her body jolted, suggesting the bolts had an unpleasant sensation associated with hitting her, but it was obvious they were otherwise harmless. "Do not overcommit to offense, Sevra. Be ready with your shield spell. It won't always be harmless bolts flying at you, and your shield spell may be the only thing that stops you from being skewered. Now, do it again, but this time, ready your offense while keeping your arcane shield on a hair trigger in your mind," he said, then readied for another round. Professor Chamberlain was idly making notes on some parchment that she produced from seemingly nowhere. A quill in hand was matched with an inkwell floating next to her. Probably not good marks. Star seemed interested in the goings on, though Amelia was very much enthralled, enough to be distracted from her studies to some degree.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra noticed the brushes on her arm, or how Star sometimes leaned into her. She didn't comment on them or encourage them, though she also didn't pull away from them either. She had been silent through the newcomers entering, even when Amelia made a surprised comment about who it was. She watched the arena change with interest, eyeing the obviously magical students. Was this place an exception to the no magic rule, or did these students somehow have permission that escaped the basic enchantments that disallowed arcane usage? She didn't ask, considering this while listening to the back and forth between the supposed professors. They were putting on a good show for the students, at least. Likely making a few chuckle, or easing tension and nerves for some of them. A good display to do that, and to get them into the best possible fighting mind. Fighting when overly nervous was never going to result in stellar scores. She leaned forward, elbows on knees and watching with rapt interest when the magical fight began. Her eyes traced the bolts that were blocked, and then returned. The corner of her mouth lifted in a small smirk when the returning bolts hit the student and had some for of impact - though obviously not deadly or fatal. The reminder to balance offence and defense was a good one, and she glanced over to Professor Chamberlain where she was making notes. Were those shared with the students, to give more detailed feedback, or just a grade? After a moment, she pulled herself back and did another glance around the viewing area, ensuring nothing had changed from a danger perspective, before looking towards Star and Amelia. Amelia was obviously also just as enthralled with the training as Ellesandra was. "Is this a rare occurrence?" She asked softly, so as to not interrupt Star if she was still successfully studying at all.
Star Lumina	"Huh?" asked Amelia, drawn away by the question. "Oh, well, it's more...To have direct instruction from either of them alone is extremely fortunate. Professor Chamberlain is a peerless alchemist. She has a lot of published works in the archives, as does Professor Yami. Professor Chamberlain is known to be a little eccentric, but the alchemical elixirs she's able to make would make your jaw drop. She could make an elixir to alter just about anything you could think of, make you grow extra arms, make you thirty feet tall, all sorts of restoratives and curatives, toxins, potions that make you fly, make you able to speak to animals, turn you invisible...Obviously to some degree people will embellish, but she and Professor Yami also a members of the Closed Circuit. Anyone who is a part of that has the sort of knowledge in their respective field to be considered an elite. Amara is also a part of it, though that is less on merit and more because of her position. Don't get me wrong, the captain is an incredible fighter who I've seen do some amazing things. It's just...Those two professors are on another level I guess. Professor Yami is an artificer. He's an exceptional wizard whose brain I'd love to be able to pick some time, but to him I'd just be a fledgling student of the arcane. You'd have to find something of exceptional rarity or power, legendary books or wonderous items to evoke his interest. Stuff like the Book of Exalted Deeds, or a Deck of Many Things or something." Amelia sighed longingly, clearly looking at both of these professors with admiration. Star smiled, watching how Amelia was possessed by such admiration, but kept her thoughts to herself and kept at least most of her focus on her books. As impressive as it all sounded, she couldn't let it distract her from the quest to save her mother. As Amelia spoke, the duel went on. Professor Yami went on to instruct his student, showing such a divide in mastery of the arcane that bordered on boredom, but there was a clear focus on his student. Every motion was studied, every incantation, every subtlety was scrutinized, and firm but focused corrections were issued. Of course, the students went up one by one, and none of them were able to so much as come close to catching the professor off guard. To be in a fight against this man was surely a death sentence, though thankfully he seemed to be a wise teacher concerned entirely with bettering his students, rather than showing off. They couldn't touch him, no. There was no chance of them scoring a hit. But he instructed them to refine their form regardless, like a drill instructor having a swordsman practice on a straw dummy. It wasn't about doing any damage, it was entirely about refinement of form. There were a fair few students to go through, and each time a student had completed, the student had praise given for the things they did right by Professor Yami, and they then were ushered over to speak to Professor Chamberlain, who spoke privately to them, presumably about what they needed to work on, as one might discern from the gestures and demonstrated stances and motions that were done a few times in repetition to cement them into the student's mind. Certainly, professor Yami had plenty to critique in the moment, but it seemed anything that didn't benefit the class at large was taken to be addressed privately. The students seemed in good spirits through it all, though there was some clear fatigue after they went through the motions. The bolts might be harmless, but they still needed mana. Nothing a handful of minutes of rest wouldn't fix. Yet even as professor Yami went on, hurling ten times the amount of bolts as each student, he seemed nowhere near breaking a sweat.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded at Amelia's answer. So they were both essentially experts in their fields. It made her even more interested in watching how they fought and taught. Obviously it wasn't a good example of them going all out and fighting, but it would still be a good example of how they handled themselves against students, as well as how their students were doing. If all of the students were performing poorly, it was a good indication that they weren't ready for what was being taught - and that was on the professor, not the student, when it might be the whole class like that. Ellesandra wasn't an expert at fighting. Oh she trained a lot, and she was more skilled than your average soldier was, maybe even up there with a few elites, but to be on the level of absolute expert? She knew and fully accepted there were people better in swordsmanship than she, not only because of her limitation with her right arm but also in just pure skill. Hell, Amara was probably better in physical combat than she was, based on what Ellesandra had seen when they fought against the black knight. Yet, she wasn't the type of prideful person who wished to be that; instead she was the type of person who sought out the people who were best in their field to learn from. For them to teach her where she was messing up, not for the goal of being the best but for the pure enjoyment of improving and being better at her job. And so, despite this being a magical duel and not one in swordsplay, she watched. It wasn't like she didn't have her own magic, even if it didn't take the form of the magic she was watching. Ellesandra's magic all focused around improving something about herself or her weapons and armor. She could enhance her magical defenses, make herself faster, improve the sharpness of a blade to cut through the hardest of materials - but she couldn't randomly send out magic missiles at a target like some of the bolts she saw below. The shield spell was one she'd tried to learn, but her magic just didn't do it right - for whatever reason. She'd made her defensive spell from it, but it wasn't the same as the shield being used to deflect the bolts below. No, if the bolts were coming at her she'd likely take a few of them directly at a reduced impact and throw them back. That or use terrain as cover. She mostly watched the students, and specifically listened to what the professors called out as things to improve on. These were what Ellesandra could learn from. So, other than glancing around occasionally, her focus was mostly entirely on the training in front of her.
Star Lumina	It was clear that this exam was meant to push the students, who were able to handle spellcraft well but had plenty of room to improve. The students were clearly competent. A few looked disappointed when they were clearly humbled before Professor Yami, as to some it was dispiriting to see just how much farther there was to go when one believed they had already come so far. Others took the instruction with determined acceptance, something that Ellesandra could liken to how they might take it. An understanding they were facing a superior, but the whole point was not to win but to lose and find out how to improve in the face of that. The students collectively performed well, and though professor Yami was clearly looking for things to call out in his students, it was balanced by equal praise, even if they were just short shouts of 'Good!' and 'Again, like that!'. Reinforcement of the positive was just as important. When all was said and done, Star had worked through one of the books entirely and moved onto the next. They weren't particularly meaty books, and much could be skimmed, but it was a good hour or two before the students had finished. There were subtle motions in the magic that Ellesandra could interpret, certain incantations, that might allow experimentation with their own magic, but it truly was a different style that would require focus to adapt to their own methods, and might offer minor refinement to existing techniques as it reinforced the importance of deliberate somatic gestures and purposeful and powerful verbal command to evoke magic properly. With that done, about ten minutes were taken in rest and review, before a staff member arrived with a rolling wooden cart that had fine wood cases for training rapiers. Professor Chamberlain moved to take one, shedding her cloak as she did so, and replaced professor Yami on the piste after a moment to put her hair up in a ponytail. "All right! Now that official class business is over, I challenge any and all who would daaaaare take on their teacher in a duel! For those of you who aspire to be spellblades, your participation is mandatory!" she declared, her tone playful. Professor Yami interjected: "No it isn't." This had professor Chamberlain putting one hand on her hip and throwing a pout at the man. "Hey. Hey. Shut up, okay? I'm the one with the stabby thing right now, don't test me," she said gesturing to the blunted rapier in her right hand. The man chuckled, clearly meeting her playful tone with equal light-heartedness. "You're still about as threatening as a pile of kittens even with a blade, you know." A comment that had the woman rolling her eyes and scoffing. "You're not helping. This is serious! Now just stand there and officiate for me, would you?" she fired back, giggling as even her attempt to sound annoyed failed her. The professors clearly had a strong rapport, and the positive energy had smiles and small laughs from the students, one of whom took up the challenge to step and stand across the piste against professor Chamberlain. Professor Yami wore a smirk and folded his arms, standing in the proper position to officiate as the two duelists approached with the traditional ceremony of vertical blades raised as they approached in lockstep, meeting one the white en garde lines. Then, professor Chamberlain took her offhand and weaved a spell that had a burst of blue energy push down onto both participants, causing their limbs and heads to briefly be surrounded with a shimmering blue light that dissipated soon after. Only their torsos did not light up, the only valid place to strike an opponent in such duels, of course. The tips of each rapier then shone with a soft red energy as the two readied themselves. Professor Yami called out the expected calls, beginning their duel of rapiers in earnest. Professor Chamberlain proved to be the superior swordswoman against this student, but Ellesandra would easily be able to see the errors pile up. The student was too much of an amateur to capitalize, but professor Chamberlain was also clearly not an accomplished swordswoman. An enthusiast, certainly. She knew what she was doing. But if Sia was present and coaching professor Chamberlain, it wouldn't be pretty. They did say it was only for recreation, after all. Something professor Chamberlain was trying to learn, and naturally shared that process with her students. It still made for a good show, with neither of them being so obviously superior to the other that it was one-sided, but either of them against Ellesandra would need some serious luck to score a hit.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra continued to watch, appreciating how Yami went through the students and gave them criticism. The positive comments were kind of shrugged off - honestly felt too hand holdy to her, but she was trained by Sia. A compliment from her meant you did really, really well, and that meant a compliment from her meant so much more to Ellesandra. Then again, she understood that type of training didn't work for everyone; some people didn't enjoy the learning as much as she did, and needed that more consistent positive feedback to keep them motivated. She glanced over to Star once as she switched books, just a brief check in to make sure she was doing alright still with the studying, before turning her attention back to the fights. As the magical training finished and the cart of training rapiers came in, Ellesandra sat even further forward. She was looking forward to potentially seeing instruction in a weapon, though as she watched Professor Chamberlain take a rapier and trade wit with Professor Yami. There was a spark of attraction - interest in this woman as she wielded a blade. Her eyes scanned the Professor, respectfully and not quite lewdly like some might in trying to undress with her eyes, but more an appreciation and interest. If Star noticed this, though, there was a...difference from the attraction Ellesandra felt for this professor, and the attraction she felt for Star earlier. This was very focused on the physicality of the woman, appreciating the way she looked and being interested in that way only. With the attraction she'd felt for Star, it wasn't just physical appreciation. It was interest in Star as a person, being attracted to her overall and even more when she was wearing her current cute outfit. And as the training began, there was a brief spark of disappointment. It became very evident immediately that Professor Chamberlain wasn't exactly 'skilled' with the blade. This didn't dim the attraction, and the disappointment left quickly. It wasn't like she would have gotten an opportunity to spar the Professor anyways, so it wasn't like she was missing out on the chance to learn from a supposed expert. It was still interesting to watch as they more...play trained, considering the Professor wasn't experienced enough to offer a full training session to the students and made multiple mistakes herself. A soft "T'ch" came from her, shaking her head. They were going to learn more bad habits that way than they would good; beyond simply getting used to the Rapier as a weapon and extension of their arm, being trained by someone who was still this early in their learning career just meant they were being taught the teacher's own bad habits.
Star Lumina	There certainly was no actual instruction happening in this bout. Professor Chamberlain was not a master of this and she knew it. It was, as had been said, recreation. Practice, rather than training. The professor wasn't using this chance to instruct or discipline, as she herself wasn't a proper mentor for it. Though regardless, Star certainly did notice the attraction. It was just physical attraction, naturally. She had seen plenty of that. But there was still something that...Stung about it. Enough to sour her mood and leave her grumpy. It wasn't like she had any security in her heart that Ellesandra wouldn't be motivated to pursue this attraction. Ellesandra wasn't...Hers. And while the logical brain might be fine to believe that it was surely the more likely scenario that pursuit of such attraction would lead to, at most, meaningless sex, that neither had any bearing on Star's shot of jealous pains nor did it particularly help even if it did occur to her. No, she didn't have any claim on the knight. But that didn't mean she could be emotionless as she saw them fawn over another woman, nor did it mean she wanted to think about them having sex with someone else. It just meant that, even as this jealousy festered in her and made her do all she could to focus on the book instead, she just...Said nothing about it. There was nothing TO say. Star had been smiling when Ellesandra had checked on her prior to the swordsmanship being displayed. But the next time Ellesandra checked on Star, there wouldn't be any smiles to be seen. No explanations for it, of course. But she wouldn't even return the looks if any were given, not as any form of punishment or anything of the sort for Ellesandra, but only because her own feelings for the knight made the whole thing messy. She was still glad they came here of course. She could see how attentive Ellesandra was. She could tell they were having a good time. She just needed some time to sort through this emotion, like any other. Amelia looked over at the 't'ch' and rose a brow, then smirked. "...Kinda makes you feel like stepping in and showing everyone how it's done when you see people less skilled than you at it, huh?"
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't notice the change in Star, not at first anyways. It wasn't until after she turned to look at Amelia when Amelia spoke that she looked to Star and saw the change in demeanor. No smile, not meeting Ellesandra's eyes, and seeming...down. Ellesandra wasn't reading her aura, but something had definitely changed. She wasn't sure what, and glanced back up to Amelia to answer her. "No, I'm not a teacher and would not be the one to show them 'how it's done', per say. I've no pride about my skill, only in the intention to learn. What they're doing is.." She waved a hand, unable to find the right word. Play and recreation like this was harmful to learning of the art, in Ellesandra's mind. Even if the Professor wasn't actively teaching, this type of practice, without a goal and more for fun, served little purpose. "Harmful at worst, useless at best." She finished. After explaining this, she turned to look at Star fully though. "Star, have you found something?" Ellesandra didn't even think about how her attraction to Professor Chamberlain was likely noticed. If she had considered that, she'd have realized that it probably bothered Star since Star had obviously implied feelings for Ellesandra, but she'd been too focused on the training and what was going on to think about Star recognizing that. Instead, she assumed the change in mood was that she'd found something in the books that spelled bad news for them.
Star Lumina	Amelia giggled. "Sheesh. And here I thought I was stuffy about my art," she said, playfully chiding to Ellesandra. There was an implied respect for Ellesandra's dedication to it all, though she didn't seem to agree with Ellesandra's characterization of it all. Professor Chamberlain did come out as the victor of the bout, taking one hit while the student was struck the rest of the times. Proper respect was shown for the ceremony of it, playing out otherwise as a bout should. The two then stepped down, with professor Chamberlain allowing students to face each other for a few bouts. The students had potential, and the practice was allowing them to refine what they did know to some small degree. Meanwhile, Ellesandra's question to Star evoked a small shake of her head and a soft "No." and nothing more. For someone who certainly could be as talkative as Star, a single word response was...not unheard of, but a bit unusual. Certainly wasn't what was bothering her, it seemed. Amelia looked at Star, then at Ellesandra, then back to Star, then out at the training grounds, as if trying to figure out what was up herself, though said nothing on the matter.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra frowned and concern flared up when Star just gave a brief 'no' to it. Her eyebrows scrunched up while watching Star, though she didn't say anything. The thing with Star was, she was typically more talkative about things that bothered her and her emotions. If she wasn't sharing something right now, it probably meant she didn't want to talk about it here. So Ellesandra reached out and lightly squeezed her shoulder, to give some encouragement and reminder that she was there to help if needed, before turning her attention back to the training. The difference, though, is that she didn't remove her hand, keeping it there as a supportive gesture for as long as Star would allow it to be there. Ellesandra also, by habit and also intention, kept the barrier up between their emotions. Which meant unless the jealousy was so overwhelming Star couldn't hold it back while touching, she still wouldn't recognize it for what it was. She was instead watching as the training bout wrapped up with the Professor having won the most hits, though she'd taken one herself. Despite her criticism for how the bouts were being held, she still watched with relative interest, and didn't verbalize criticism again.
Star Lumina	Star didn't resist the hand, and the emotional wall did mean there was no leaking of her jealous feelings. There was part of her that appreciated it, part of her that wanted to squirm her shoulder out from under Ellesandra's hand. That was the jealous part. The part of her that wanted to emotionally lash out and storm off, telling the knight to go fuck the teacher already. But not only was Star able to recognize just how...Utterly out of proportion that all was, she also knew that it was all just a knee-jerk reaction. All just a perversion of her ACTUAL desire to be the one Ellesandra couldn't take their eyes off of. And with the time to process it, the time to let it feel and ride out its natural conclusions in her heart, she was able to take a slow, calming breath that then exhaled. And with it, some of the jealousy faded away, fluttering free and away from her. It was all new to her. This...Jealousy, this side effect of romantic attraction. She was able to deal with it. She just needed time and a little exposure to it. She still felt its bitter claws tear at her, but she stood calm in the storm. It was unfortunately rather distracting from her attempts to study. Time passed, and the recreational swordfights concluded. The professors dismissed the class for the day, and then went off together after professor Chamberlain retrieved her cloak. Some of the people in the stands had come and gone as the time and subject had passed. People were polite and quiet as they moved about. Occasional conversations were ongoing, but quiet and kept to the small groups, just as Ellesandra, Star, and Amelia had done. The training grounds were quiet for a time, and it was about twenty minutes before the next group arrived. This group was led by a dragonborn instructor who had bright golden scales and wore a heavy set of plate mail with a red cape. A tower shield in one hand, a longsword in the other. The students that joined along with this instructor were donning armor, varied from half-plate to full plate. Each one had a shield and their choice of martial weapon, each of the shields bearing a holy symbol. Straw dummies were set up for them, and the instructor began a brief lecture to remind the students about how to properly harness divine magic, as would prove to be the subject of the practical lesson, though for the immediate it was just talk of how one embraced the power from their oaths. More than a few of the students had the same symbol, however, which was the same one seen all around the athenaeum - the symbol of the Followers of Myst. There was no god or goddess associated with that symbol, so it was curious to see it being used as a holy symbol, and in divine magics instruction.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't just fuck everyone she was attracted to, and probably would have been a little insulted at Star saying that if she had. Not that she would have been against having sex with the Professor, other than knowing that Star had feelings for her and being concerned about how that would play out. Either way, she kept the comforting hand on Star's shoulder and gave a light squeeze. Eventually she pulled it off just for the comfort of not keeping her right hand held up like that, but she kept their shoulders touching. A constant reminder that, for whatever was bothering Star, Ellesandra was there. She watched as the class ended and then left, letting the silence of no current training wash over them. Even with that, Ellesandra felt more comfortable here than she had in recent history with Star. It wasn't that she was less comfortable with Star herself, but more just the area. It was fancier than what Ellesandra was used to, with the magical barrier and the stands and the obvious use as training grounds, but it's overall purpose was the same. She relaxed here, though still with her guard up for anyone who came close or might be watching them. During that 20 minutes, Ellesandra would have reached for one of the smaller books that hadn't been touched by the two magic users yet, more idly flipping through it and doing what scanning - as inefficiently as it was - she could. Whether or not she found anything interesting - she didn't expect to, and was more doing it out of a small bit of guilt at letting Star and Amelia do all the research while she just sat there - she paused and looked up when she heard people heading into the training area again. Her eyes fell on the obvious plate armor and the symbols they had, it taking not long at all to see that it was either a cleric or paladin training session. She kept an ear on it and watched them use their magic and the explanations given, but her interest in this was obviously less than the interest in the previous bouts. Whether that had been from being attracted to the professor or topic might be unknown to Star, though in reality it was mostly the topic. Divine magic always escaped Ellesandra, and as none of them seemed to be of a deity she personally related to or followed - or some didn't even look to be of a deity - her interest was more a casual observer here.
Star Lumina	Star was going through a lot, not because her feelings were particularly intense - she longed to be the one in the center of Ellesandra's eyes, but she also knew she had no claim on them - but because it was, by Star's own admission, the first time she'd ever been in a situation where there was the prospect of mutual attraction. The new territory had the raw feelings burning through her and making her think things she didn't truly mean. Things she would regret saying aloud the moment she said them. It was only by the grace of her already strong command of her own emotional state that she was able to keep a clear head about it. After the storm of emotion had passed, she took emotional stock of herself, and realized that this whole time, Ellesandra was making small motions to keep a comforting presence on her. She knew it was there, but the other emotions distracted from it. Focusing on that small, thoughtful action was enough to be the icy bucket of water splashing over her head. She audibly sighed, briefly closing her eyes. She was being...So stupid. And though it might have been a little forward, she slid her left hand down between them to find Ellesandra's right hand. She gently took their hand in hers and gave it a squeeze as she opened her eyes and looked over at Ellesandra. A warm smile was given for their thoughtful support for an inner battle that they might not even realize Star had been fighting. She knew that hand holding was a bit forward, however, so she planned to release if she felt discomfort from the knight at the touch.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had noticed that Star was off, but had no idea why and had just assumed that she didn't want to talk about it while in public. Which was odd in and of itself for Star, but would have been perfectly normal for Ellesandra if she'd found something odd in the readings and she didn't want to share too much about her origin or magic with Amelia. So, Ellesandra hadn't questioned it, just tried to offer support while watching the paladins - or clerics? - train below. When she felt Star sigh, there was just a glance over to make sure she was okay, a glance at Amelia to see if she knew any reason why Star was upset, but assuming there was no indication she just went back to her observation. When Star reached down and took her hand, though? There were multiple things that happened at once. Confusion, surprise, and - and her heart skipped a beat. Those feelings, locked away, flared up. Butterflies happened. Nervous anxiety, unsure what to do from that. All of this happened in just a moment or two after Star took her hand, and Ellesandra had stared down at their fingers linked in the obvious surprise. Her eyebrows had scrunched up, unsure what to make of this, and then she looked over at Star with...concern. Was whatever was bothering Star so bad she felt the need to hold Ellesandra's hand? Because Star's feelings for Ellesandra, though they'd been implied previously, weren't the first things to come to her mind. Instead, Ellesandra assumed that whatever had upset Star had done so so much that she needed to hold onto Ellesandra for the support, similar to how she needed a hug when finding out about her mother. "Star." Ellesandra muttered quietly. She didn't take her hand away, and squeezed Star's in what was intended as a supportive option. "Do you want to go back and finish studying in the guild hall? Or chat about something?" With Ellesandra actively deciding to focus on there being a potential problem, the feelings that had flared up slowly died back down. Not forgotten, and still there. But kept in their cage to not be focused on, like Ellesandra was so good at doing.
Star Lumina	Amelia was very much doing her own thing, offering only a brief side-glance when looked at that quietly said none of this was any of her business. Though there seemed to be something lingering on her. Something unsaid. Something that also briefly caught Star's attention as she looked vaguely to the side as if trying to look at Amelia while her head was actively facing Ellesandra. A lot of things seemed to be being left unsaid in the moment. Star focused on Ellesandra, though, and their muttered words evoked a small amount of surprise. She considered the words for a moment. Her heart throbbed briefly as the amorous emotions in her heart made the impressive leap from what Ellesandra actually said to the interpretation of 'studying' being more cuddling and kissing and a lot of other things that Star ought not to be thinking about in public. But that was briefly shoved aside. No. Bad Star. Down, girl. Ultimately she gently shook her head. "We can chat later, if you still want to," she said softly, with the gentle warmth to her tone restored. But seeing that Ellesandra wasn't fighting the hand-hold, she was slightly emboldened to just...Let that gesture linger. Armored gauntlets on the knight's hands meant it wasn't quite the touch she truly desired, but it was good enough. She then returned her attention to her book, not shutting off from Ellesandra but simply trying to refocus. If they had more to say, she was happy to talk. She just was going to need to resist the urge to lay her head on their shoulder while reading now. While this all happened, the paladins below set about doing their drills. This group seemed capable, a bit more advanced than previous groups. The dragonborn leader addressed them strongly, but not like a drill instructor would new recruits. It started with exercises to get limber, then became a show live weapon fighting. These were not training weapons. They were very much lethal blades, maces, warhammers, axes, and the like, all well-cared for with edges sharp and blunt faces, well, shiny and blunt. The instructor briefly addressed the audience by clarifying that these fights were in preparation for final examination, and that injuries were going to happen, and blood would be spilled. There was an offer for any who felt they could not view such things to leave. One person in the audience did indeed get up and depart at the warning. Star looked briefly uncomfortable, but not enough to say anything. The instructor went on to explain that this training was as much about martial ability as it was training defensive and curative powers, and that there were extra healers on standby to ensure nobody would suffer permanent injury or death, clarifying further that all the students had on them the magic of a Death Ward, which would trigger should they sustain lethal injury and place them in a safe, stable condition that prevented death so they could be healed. Seemed that the show that was about to play out was one where nobody was holding back.
Ellesandra	She wasn't quite sure what to make of all of this. And though there was something inside her that really enjoyed holding Star's hand, she wasn't let the hold continue for that reason. She was concerned about Star, and assuming that Star needed that type of physical touch to feel better, since Star was a much more tactile person. Or at least, that's what she told herself. It was partially true, to be fair. As they continued on for some basic drills, and then the instructor gave warning that they would be live duels, with magic to protect eachother but that there would be bloodshed during the duels, Ellesandra leaned forward. Her interest was peaked much more, and though she glanced around to see the one person leaving and doing another visual sweep of the room to check for threats, her focus quickly returned to the fights. While Star might feel uncomfortable at this, Ellesandra looked and felt excited for these fights. Oh, she wasn't excited for bloodshed, specifically. No, she was excited for seeing real fights where people weren't holding back. To watch people give it their all, knowing that their opponent wouldn't suffer any fatal injuries. Sure, there was an aspect that knowing you yourself couldn't suffer a fatal injury would lead to you being a little more reckless, but overall this was the closest she'd get to watching real fights here. And so, her eyes stayed on the combatants, looking more interested than she had even when the hot professor was using a rapier - poorly.
Star Lumina	Star's discomfort was only momentary. Yes, she disliked violence. That was where the knee-jerk reaction came. But with a bit more careful consideration, thinking that it was all under supervision, that these people were comrades fighting not to hurt each other, but to better defend themselves when it was truly an enemy that was trying to kill them. Necessary violence to prevent tragedy later. It comforted her, though she still didn't particularly want to watch it, even knowing how necessary it was. All the more focus on her studies as the first bout began. A human male wielding a warhammer versus an elven male wielding a longsword. Both had kite shields. They moved into the center of the room, everyone else stood far away to give them a wide berth of room to engage one another without interference. The two shook hands, nodding to each other with smiles, then took a few paces away from one another. The smiles gave way to serious expressions as each donned their helmets then drew their weapons, and an unseen crash of cymbals announced the start of the fight. The human man took an initial offensive, charging forward while the elven man rose his longsword up in the air as golden shields of light shot out from around him with the magic of Shield of Faith. So it was that when warhammer met the readied shield of the elven man, it bounced off with a golden flash of light and made the human reel back. The elf moved to capitalize, only to be met with a staunch shield bash from the human, forcing the elf to defend and miss the chance to land a punishing strike. A series of full-on, traded blows ensued, with each strike being met with practiced, refined blocks, parries, and movements to balance offense and defense. All the combatants were of the same fighting style - frontline combatants who were intended to lead the charge and hold the line, combatants tenacious enough to stand tall in even protracted engagements and keep fighting, so it would be that these bouts would each take quite some time. After a series of traded blows, with neither side gaining much ground on the other, the human managed a solid parry with his shield that opened up his opponent, and rather than go for a typical strike, he leapt up and raised his warhammer high as it began to shine with bright golden light, so that when it came back down to meet the swiftly produced shield of his opponent, it resonated with a powerful BOOM of magical force that knocked the elven man back with force enough that there was visible fatigue in the elven man's shield arm. Something might have broken from that strike. The human pushed his advantage by going for a second strike, but the elven man stepped forward and was enveloped by silvery mist that saw him stepping through his opponent with a Misty Step and appearing again behind the human to swing with a circular horizontal strike as he pivoted on one foot, slashing at one of the gaps in the human's plate to bite into their skin as his sword, too, glowed with golden magical force to produce a similar boom of magic. Smites. The hallmark attack of a paladin, expended eagerly in this fight to make the strikes they did manage to land that much stronger. The blade ripped through the chain shirt the human wore and earned a loud cry of pain from the human as blood was sprayed onto the wooden floor. The human responded by straightening his posture swiftly and pulling his arms against himself, surging with mana that caused an explosive wave of force to burst from his chest, which forced the elven man onto his backfoot as the explosive force knocked him off balance. When the human turned, he gave a quick nod at his opponent while both caught their bearings again. A respectful gesture to acknowledge a good hit. The elven man returned in kind, his shield arm clearly weaker as it failed to assume as firm a stance as it had at the start. The human took a few tentative steps back, putting some distance between them. The elven man allowed the distance, not because of mercy or friendship, but because it was clearly mutually advantageous; each man used their magical healing to restore themselves in that moment. While there was a chance to keep pressure, the choice to restore themselves was more suited for their combat role of sustained fighting. It also meant that the two were able to go right back into a series of blows and counterblows that showed just how much stamina they had trained in themselves. Ten minutes of fighting, and neither seemed to be tiring significantly. It was similarly clear they weren't holding back; Ellesandra would be able to see the weight and intention behind each thrust, each swing of their weapon, and how hastily they had to interpose their shields against incoming attacks at times. They were certainly trying to kill each other, but each had greater defense than offense, and they were still, ultimately, trainees. Mistakes were subtle, and few and far between. They had refined their craft and learned from masters. They knew what they were doing, and were going all-out. Rage-fueled shouts were plentiful as each gave all their muscles could sustain into each strike, and each were undoubtedly sweating buckets under their armor. But they fought on, trading strike for strike, smite for smite, with some attacks sending the other off their feet, and one incident in particular saw the elven man hitting the human with a smite that had the human burst into flames under his armor, which evoked the expected cries of pain as flames shot out from every gap in his plate. Yet even that wasn't enough to stop him, and the fighting continued with occasional intentional backsteps to heal themselves as best they could. Blow for blow, strike for strike, spatter of blood for broken bone, block for block again and again and again, until ultimately, the elven man tripped the human and went in for a diving, plunging strike with his longsword that looked sure to hit square in the chest, only for the human to roll just enough to take the sword in his shield-arm's shoulder, crying in pain but having the perfect chance to swing his warhammer up and loudly CLANG against the elven man's helmet. A moment of pause happened, then, before the elven man slowly just...Toppled over to his side, blood trickling out from under his helm. A blow to the head that, without the death ward, would have caved in the elven man's skull. The human man lay there, sword jutting out of his shoulder, panting, and fell limp, totally spent. There were no applause or celebrations. Instead, the healing staff mentioned previously ran in, separated the two men, and magically began tending to the wounds of each. Motion in the elven man after some healing showed they were still alive, and a few minutes of tending to each would see them able to at least sit up, stable. But each of them was definitely going to need to rest, and were sure to get some feedback about what they did well and poorly in due time. Then, it was a matter of cleaning up the significantly bloodied arena before the next bout would begin.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched with rapt attention as the two men really went at it. There were a few times she winced, including when the smite on the shield obviously damaged the mans arm. She could imagine the pain from some of those blows and silently commended them for fighting through it. These weren't brand new trainees, or people inexperienced in their particular craft. These were, while still in training, decent fighters and knew enough that it wouldn't be a 'quick' bout for either side. At least, not unless one really stood out amongst the class. She winced again when the blow to the head happened, almost as if it rang out and she knew that there was going to be a victory there. Even if the other didn't collapse from that, it'd certainly disorient them enough to be finished off. Still, as he collapsed and the healers ran out, she also leaned forward to watch them heal and make sure the men were okay. There was a minor bit of envy at this. Ellesandra had never been able to practice bout like this, considering her resistance to healing magic. There was always too much of a risk that someone would give her a truly fatal blow that wouldn't be able to be properly healed due to her unique...magical limitations. Oh she'd gotten injured plenty while training and sparring, but it was always something that was planned to be less serious of blows than not. A broken arm here and there, breaking a finger or bruising something badly. She'd even had a bad fall once that popped her shoulder out of socket, but nothing like what the two men were experiencing below. Being set on fire with a searing smite, a full on blow to the head, stabbing through the other's shoulder - none of those were fun experiences that your average person would want to experience, but for Ellesandra it meant you were really giving it your all, and thus able to learn more from it. This was why she was envious of the opportunity. Either way, as the two were getting healed up and the next bout was preparing to begin, she looked over to check in on Amelia and Star again. Star, to see if anything had changed about her being upset about something, and also to see if she was feeling comfortable with the direction these training bouts had taken. She surely hadn't expected them to be suddenly trying to mock-kill one another below, and she'd said before she wasn't great with killing. "We don't have to stay here if this makes you uncomfortable." She offered to both of them, since she wasn't sure how Amelia felt about it.
Star Lumina	Amelia gave another typical side-eye with a raised brow, as if not even understanding what could be so bad about what was going on that she could be uncomfortable. The instructor said it all. There was no real danger, outside of some freak accident nobody could predict. But living in Myst had taught Amelia that, within these walls, within the athenaeum, everything had been accounted for when it came to training. There were no accidents. At least not ones that didn't have proper intervention ready to go. But looking at Star, Amelia seemed to pick up on things a bit more. Star wasn't visibly uncomfortable, no. She looked fine. But Amelia put two and two together. Must be something that Star didn't like, so she added: "No big deal either way, I'm fine to stay or move elsewhere." A small signal of solidarity with Ellesandra's efforts to ensure Star was comfortable, if nothing else. But Star had seen the envy in Ellesandra, the excitement at watching. She didn't personally 'get' it. But she didn't have to. Ellesandra was enjoying it, and that was enough for her. So Star just smiled at Ellesandra and shook her head. "Honestly it's...Better they have such support around when learning these things. It's a bit too much for me to watch directly...Makes me a little queasy, really...But I can tell they don't want to hurt each other." She could see a lot of good in the hearts of the trainees, too, but she refrained from sharing that. It didn't take a magical sense to see they were all vaguely friends or at least had mutual respect for each other enough to not actually enjoy hurting one another, however. "Besides. I can tell you're enjoying it. I'm glad you agreed to come here. Much more enjoyable for you than just whittling or trying your very best to stave off relentless boredom, don't you think?" Star said with a smile. "Tell me about what you like about this. I like hearing about the things you like."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra shook her head. She wanted to say that it didn't matter if she enjoyed it, the fact it was making Star queasy was enough to go back to the guild hall instead. But then Star asked her a question, and she sighed, knowing that it was a distraction tactic. Even if it wasn't intentionally one, it worked as one. "I never got to train like that. They're passionate about this, take it seriously, and are able to go all out. I'm sure there's a bit of factor in that they know they can't actually die during the fight due to the magic on them, so they might be a little more reckless than they would be in a real world scenario, but they aren't afraid to completely give it their all and fight as if it were a real world scenario. Because of how magic works on me, that type of training just...wasn't possible. There was always a chance someone would injure me in a way I couldn't truly be healed from." She shrugged, turning her attention back down to the pit. "So it's nice, being able to see them giving it their all. Fun to watch, anyways. It can be an art, fighting. Both in posh, well orchestrated ruled show bouts, but also this type of fighting. This is the fighting that you can see applicable skill, see how someone would handle themselves in the situation. That's exactly what needs to be trained into a lot of fighters. Just add in some elements of surprise now, to keep them on their toes and their awareness up, and you can simulate most of what you'd experience in the real world." She glanced over to Amelia. "It's like appreciating the art of another magic user, I'd think. Everyone does it differently, but gets to the same result. And some people are just, better at it. To learn from people who are much better at something than you are is nice, really."
Star Lumina	Star smiled. She truly was fine to be present here, though she was honest to a fault in admitting how violence was hard to watch. But she placed Ellesandra having a good time over any discomfort she might feel. There was a warmth to her that blossomed out from her heart, showing on her face as she listened to Ellesandra explain. These were things that her powers could not intuitively tell her. She could understand some amount of baser reasoning behind an emotion, but nothing as detailed as this. Nothing that truly explained why someone felt a certain way on complex matters. At least, if it was possible, she wasn't good enough with her powers to yet discern such things intuitively. But even then, people tended to be happier when they spoke about things they liked. "You don't have to tell me what it's like want to learn from someone better than you," said Star with a smile and a pleasant giggle. Star wasn't without her own barriers to getting better at her art, after all. There was exactly one person who Star could learn from, and they happened to be looking for just that person. And oh, did Star have such beautiful memories of when she was able to learn from her mother. Those good memories were all that kept her from feeling sorrow in thinking about the fact that her mother was still lost to her. "Maybe someday I'll figure out a way to heal you that would let you do that sort of thing. I think that'd be nice, even if it'd be a little hard to watch you get hurt, even knowing it was controlled like this," said Star, thinking aloud. Naturally it seemed she wasn't considering her sympathetic healing to be an appropriate tool for such things, as she knew Ellesandra would never approve of her taking on the agony of Ellesandra's wounds for anything short of an emergency. Meanwhile, Amelia gave another sidelong glance. "What're you looking at me for?" she grumbled, blushing just a bit as she averted her gaze. Not sure what to make of the glance, Amelia just defaulted to her huffy, pouty self that had thus far been absent. Star giggled. "Your dedication to the arcane really is worthy of praise, Amelia," said Star. "I'm sure there's people who would love to learn from you. I'm sure there's a lot you could teach me, too." An earnest, heartfelt set of words that hardly would be surprising coming from Star, but it still seemed to strike an arrow in the right place in Amelia's heart, causing them to blush up a storm and clam up, bringing the book they were studying right up to their face to cover their cheeks while grumbling something unintelligible. Star just smiled, then looked at Ellesandra with a knowing smile. "Was there anyone besides Sia you would say you ever found you could learn from, or look up to in terms of martial skill, Ellesandra? I imagine most knights you knew preferred a longsword or something. I'm...Really not sure how transferable the skill is between a rapier and other weapons like that. I mean. Obviously. I don't think I've ever even wielded a weapon before, eheh.." She was still holding Ellesandra's hand through all this, of course. If they weren't going to let go, neither was she.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched Amelia's reaction to the compliments and smirked to herself. There was amusement, as well as a familiar sense of protectiveness over Amelia - not that she'd ever actually let Amelia know that, because she'd likely be offended at this bit. There wasn't any of the attraction though, so Star's senses would hopefully not pick up anything jealous worthy. Amelia was cute, but didn't seem to be her type. At the redirection back to her, though, Ellesandra tilted her head to the side, looking at Star curiously. "You saw the memory in which I was using a longsword and shield, Star. I didn't always fight with a rapier. I believe I mentioned my default weapon before I came into my magic was a spear and shield, and then just a spear once I did with a shield on my back for optional use. In fact, it wasn't until my right arm was injured that I really used a rapier as my main choice of weapon. I was trained in it previously of course, I've gone through extensive training in most common weapons." She then turned her head to look back at the training field. "And there were plenty better than me. I mentioned Aeras before, he certainly was better than me at hammer and shield. Because I'm a spellblade and because of my ability to absorb and redirect magic, my focus was never really on fighting soldiers one on one. I was trained as a counter against magic users, initially. Until I enlisted myself as a guard, I was being setup for a special force to specifically go against magic users in the field, if they were encountered." She glanced between Amelia and Star again at commenting on that, not wanting to make either of them uncomfortable with that knowledge. "Once I changed that path, I started focusing on more personal ability, but anyone who is truly skilled or good at their art can beat me in a martial fight, no magic included. I'm sure Amara would wipe the floor with me, magic or not."
Star Lumina	Star saw nothing that would trigger any jealousy. In fact, that protectiveness over Amelia was something that made Star smile even more. Knowing they would get along rather than have friction around one another was calming. Comforting. Star always preferred when people got along, after all. Star looked a little flustered when being told about the memory she already had seen, and yes she did recall it, but she hadn't known specifically if Ellesandra preferred the rapier or what the cause was for choosing it, or if Ellesandra had preferences for other weapons. So rather than just think about it aimlessly, she asked: "I see. Well, if you could fight with any weapon, if your arm was healed, what would you fight with?" she asked, tilting her head. "I mean, I'm sure you remember that I do want to heal your arm. I think I can do it. It just might, well...Take a bit, is all." And might result in Star having some anguish in her own right shoulder for a while, but she wasn't going to draw attention to that. Neither of the two seemed uncomfortable with Ellesandra being a mage slayer. Seemed that Ellesandra being their ally made any worries about it vanish. If anything, the little flick from Amelia's ear might indicate that she saw it as a compliment. Someone needing to be dedicated specifically to kill her because she was so dangerous? Yeah, she could take that as a bonus to her ego, sure. Star just simply could not envision a scenario where Ellesandra would ever want to hurt her, so it never could make her uncomfortable. "Probably important that we remember to let captain know that, in the event we do get into a fight again," said Amelia offhandedly. "The whole...Mage-killer thing. Magic users are probably captain's greatest weakness, after all." All comments said from behind the safety of her book, naturally. Still hiding her face.
Ellesandra	She took some time to consider the question about what weapon she'd prefer to use. She hadn't answered or come up with an answer by the time Amelia offhandedly mentioned they should tell the captain that. She looked over, tilting her head. "You two plan on fighting with us again?" Were they hoping, or planning, to come with them to Gurhal? There had been mention about sending scouting parties there, but she wasn't sure if Star had felt comfortable with that or would agree to it. And even if others came, whether it would be Amelia and Amara hadn't been confirmed. Either way though, she turned to add to Star. "I'm best with Spear and shield, martially. Though I'm a bit out of practice with it, seeing as it's been about three years since I really wielded either. I'm...fond of the rapier though." She didn't specify why, and honestly Star wouldn't really need to ask why. There was a mixture of grief and...emotional attachment to it. Marigold had used one, and Ellesandra had trained her in it. The rapier would have a nostalgic place for her, always, and she doubted she'd ever entirely stop using one. Maybe not as her main weapon if her right shoulder was healed - which was a big if since Ellesandra would entirely resist the sympathetic healing for it, or really any healing - but still available and a comfort on her hip.
Star Lumina	"No I think next time one of your six trillion enemies show up I'd just stand off to the side and place bets with the captain instead," said Amelia, lowering her book to give a playfully sarcastic look at Ellesandra. "But to seriously answer your question," she hastily continued, obviously knowing the point wasn't whether they would stand shoulder to shoulder with the knight but more whether their paths would diverge in Myst. "Whether you want captain and I to come along with you directly or not, I'm finding it pretty likely that Serenity will dispatch us to Gurhal, once we figure out how to get there. It's not a very good first impression for the archives to turn up so few books on a plane like this," she said, motioning to what they had before them. "Because you'll just have to trust me when I say it's typical that if you wanted to pull all the information there was in the archives on a single plane, it'd be thousands of books. Maybe tens or hundreds of thousands if it's a place as well traveled as Faerun or as magically significant as the Feywilds or something. So you can bet that it's in the interest of the admins of Myst that SOMEBODY bring back knowledge from Gurhal." She gently shrugged. "Just seems like the natural conclusion that, if you two are in want for company and a bit more security on the road, that we join you. There'll just be some terms to figure out, I guess, if it plays out that way." That all explained, Amelia focused back on her book. Star had a few things to consider between the two topics. The next bout had begun down below while they were talking. A silver dragonborn woman with a shield and longsword against a dwarven man with a two handed maul. Just as the last, these two gave each other no quarter, and the sound of metal on metal served as the backdrop to the conversation. "Hmm. I guess shield and rapier is kinda a weird combination?" Star asked, innocently. "I can't say I'm against you having a little more in the way of defense, with how hard it is to heal you. But you're right that I can't really imagine you never using your rapier. It just seems to...Fit you, I guess."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra considered what Amelia said. More security on the road would certainly be nice, in all honesty. Especially knowing that they were actively walking into what would probably be multiple traps between wherever they came out at, and Star's mother. She turned her attention back over to Star though, as she commented on rapier and shield. "I've seen it done before, but it's awkward. Rapier's are designed for one handed use with your other hand being a balance to your movements. Having a heavy shield in the offhand would throw off a lot of typical fighting maneuvers. They're designed to parry and slip under guards, not go head to head against a longsword for long bouts." She shrugged again, turning her attention back down to fight, more watching it mindlessly while talking now. "It does add protection, but keep in mind I need a hand free in order to use my magic. There are shields that strap to your arm as well that would still allow that, but they're not usually designed for the ease of movement a rapier demands. Even my armor gets in the way sometimes. I've grown accustomed to instead using the rapier as a way to redirect weapons and then sliding into their guard instead." There was no comment about Star saying the rapier fit her. But it was something that tugged at one of those locked up again grief emotions. One that caused her to momentarily have to clench her teeth and push back down, before continuing on with her explanation. "A rapier works well with spellblades in general because they're light, easy to use, and can be done smoothly with a lot of magical abilities. They make the most of my haste spell, for example, because they're based on being quick and flighty. If I were using my normal spear, it's slower overall. A haste spell, while still beneficial, won't have as much of an impact when using that versus a weapon like the rapier."
Star Lumina	"You've certainly put a lot of thought into this, not that that's really surprising," said Star with a smile. She felt the grief, and while it wasn't something she intended, she also felt it was important that Ellesandra be able to feel it. Now wasn't the time to process it, but she thought perhaps she might be able to talk that out with them another time, if she could discern more of the root of that feeling. "Then maybe there's a way instead to empower your defensive magic. You having a natural resistance to magic has been helpful so far, but maybe there is armor that can have a similar effect to these clothes, something to further your speed..." Star thoughtfully pursed her lips to the side for a moment. "I couldn't help but notice all the stock they had in the guild shop. Price was a bit beyond us but...If we could find a way to make a bunch of money, or come across it in our travels, I'd say it'd be a good investment to get you something better, if anything caught your eye. Really I...Have been meaning to talk to you about combat related stuff for a while, honestly. Even if it's just tactics...There's undoubtedly going to be a lot of fighting ahead of us. So I think it'd be important for us to have these kinds of conversations. If all it takes is a little discussion to prevent future injuries, then it's silly not to, right? I might not be so good at offensive magic, but my magic can be used for a lot of things that would help give you the upper hand. Not that I could practice anything here, but...There's a few things I never really brought up in the past about our resonance that could help us be more effective together." Naturally, as Star explained, Amelia's attention was drawn in, to the point that the term 'resonance' had one brow raising. Star's magic was still a mystery to her, after all.
Ellesandra	She frowned at the idea of them spending any more of their money on armor for her. She'd of course seen the guild stores, and how much of it looked certainly better than her current armor, but she hadn't even considered getting anything there. Not only did she not consider the 'party fund' hers to use, she also knew that even if she did, they didn't exactly have enough funds to do that while also surviving on their remaining funds for their journey. "I appreciate the thought, Star.." She said, releasing Star's hand but only because she was turning fully in her seat, readjusting how she was sitting so she could face Star full on. The comment about their resonance and using magic to help one another had her glancing at Amelia briefly before back to Star and refocusing on the topic. She wasn't sure how she felt about other people knowing they had resonance, since it felt...personal somehow. But she also wasn't focusing on that right now, anyways. "We don't have the funds for that, and the type of money that would be needed to buy such a thing isn't something we could just make easily panhandling on the street. I tend to make a few gold per guard job, just taking one merchant caravan to the next city and such. I could potentially get more if I hire myself out as an adventurer to go slay some beast, but not only would that potentially be putting our main mission on hold, it would involve danger for you if you went and that's directly against what I'm here to do. And don't pretend you'd be comfortable with me going on a mission like that alone." She added the last bit quickly, knowing Star well enough by now that she knew Star wouldn't like that idea. "I'm quite fine as I am I think, though I agree when we have time, we should discuss your capabilities in more measure and how we can work together on the battlefield. As long as doing so isn't putting you in danger."
Star Lumina	Star was a little sad to let the handhold go, but she didn't fight it. It was longer than she had expected it would last, so she could be okay with that at least. She was a bit surprised to see Ellesandra turn to face her directly, but she shifted slightly to turn diagonally towards them in respectful matching of their body language. She smiled at her companion of course. "I'm not looking to put either of us in danger, Ellesandra. And I certainly won't be panhandling, nor have I ever saw fit to purchase a shiny new set of clothes if it would leave me destitute," she said, pulling attention to her...Shiny new set of clothes, implying she knew they were fine to purchase it with their funds available. "I'm not saying we try to get it immediately. I did say the price was beyond us right now, didn't I? I'm not going to do anything reckless, but I think it would be equally reckless to not put some of the funds towards protecting the frontline fighter." Star was electing to use more tactical language to make it make more sense to Ellesandra. Of course, she didn't care if Ellesandra was a frontline or backline or no-line or squiggly upside-down line fighter. She wanted them safe. She didn't want to see them hurt. But if it took talking tactics to achieve it, so be it. "Not that it's a competition, but how do you think I've survived on my own? People are more than willing to pay for magical healing services, particularly in places where magic is scarce. There'd be steady work for me in Hotenz if I needed something to do, though I admit that's based on my understanding of it rather than actually having ever been there. Much as I am eager to move forward, we have to prepare for what we both know we're up against." She paused, giving Ellesandra a more serious look. "It's more than likely that armor would have killed us both if we were alone. And that doesn't even begin to compare against the magic I felt resonating from the jerk who summoned it. This isn't just me being sentimental. This is me wanting to keep us both alive. I need you by my side, Ellesandra...And the better equipped you are, the better you'll be able to keep me safe, too." She gently smiled. "We're going to make it through this, together. And I think we both know that we'll have to both get stronger to face the perils that are waiting for us. I might have gone head-first against the pirates, knowing I could make it out alive. But I'd never be so reckless unless I knew I was coming out the other side okay. And after what happened to us just before coming to Myst, well...I'm feeling a lot more cautious as we get ready to head to Gurhal." Star already did have a healthy preservation instinct of course but...Knowing how important her safety was to Ellesandra, particularly in relation to their mountain of grief and trauma? Star might just end up half as paranoid as the knight by the time they were to head to Gurhal.
Ellesandra	She...sighed. The thing was, Star made good points. She had to admit it to herself, even if she wanted to disagree with the idea of them going out of their way to do this in order to get her armor. "We can improve by fighting together, using your magic to cover me. If we find an opportunity to get money while we're going and then have the option, sure. But I don't want to delay what we're doing just to get me armor." She didn't want to say why she didn't want to delay for that reason, either. Maybe Star would get it, but the idea that they'd arrive a day or two late because they decided to go off and do some healing jobs for money in order to buy Ellesandra better armor or equipment would - well, that would haunt her. There was real fear that doing something like that would result in something bad happening as a result, and the memory with Sia came back. She already had the death of a charge on her mind, she really didn't want the death of Star's mother on her mind as well. She pursed her lips for a moment, then nodded. "But I'll relent, if we have time and get the money anyways, then sure. I'll look to find something that works for me in one of the shops around town, or the guild hall if that's still open to us at that time." She didn't want to assume so. She did look at Amelia as she said this though, knowing that they were guests of the guild for now and not wanting to assume or be ungrateful about being able to remain such.
Star Lumina	Star gave a soft smile, though she wasn't entirely satisfied by the answer. "...I know, Ellesandra. I know what you're thinking. At least...Part of it. It hurts me just as much to delay. But there are thousands of delays I've already allowed that could be just as much to blame if the worst comes to pass and we find ourselves just barely too late. I'm focused. I'm driven. There's nothing I want more than to charge straight to my goal. But rushing out and dying isn't the answer just as much as sitting around working for years to make sure we have the absolute best possible things money can buy before we set out. There's a balance. Reasonable times to pause, short term goals that benefit the long term objective and may result in saving more time than they cost. A week of work early enough that saves a month of resting off injuries that you end up not sustaining from the better equipment pays for itself in time and in ensuring you have to deal with me fussing over you that much less," she said with a sweet, playful smile. "All I'm asking is that we be smart about this. It'll take more than just us fighting together and good tactics if the enemy ahead of us is so much more powerful. Trust me it's...Always been hard for me to accept money from people in excess of me being able to afford what I needed. Knowing what I know now, I would have gravely regret it if things played out differently and I had returned the money to Morrun. It's...An adjustment for sure, knowing I'll have to take all I can get. But it's for the best. Preparedness is one major part of keeping ourselves safe." She then looked more directly at Ellesandra. Directly in the eyes. Words then followed that meant more than she was saying: "I'm not going to die on you. And you're not going to die on me, either." Both her hands came to take one of Ellesandra's. She knew she was riding dangerously close to a point of grief for the knight, so she was hopeful that her encouraging tone, her firm stance on prioritizing safety, would offer some comfort to Ellesandra. No recklessness. No martyring herself. They would do this intelligently. They would do it together. That's how they would stay alive. Amelia, not wanting to interrupt, kept to herself. But she was half-listening to anything that didn't seem personal. And at the look, she gave a little nod. They'd figure something out, one way or another. Amelia might have an attitude, but she seemed...Happy. Not that she was actively showing it, but...Her insistence to keep close to Star and Ellesandra, if one read into her actions, suggested that she was finding friendship in the two of them, so it was the natural consequence that she'd want to support them if she could, which included leveraging her guild membership.
Ellesandra	She hated that Star was right, and that she agreed with her. It made sense, even if she hated admitting that. Shaking her head, she tried to find a logical reason not to do any of this, but she didn't have one. And then Star reached out and took her hand, and there was a gut wrenching pull on her stomach at those words. Ellesandra did an amazing job, all being said, of keeping a stoic face at the grief that was pulled out again at those words. At the acceptance and guilt that was there because, in all honesty, Ellesandra was fully prepared to be a martyr, to die for Star. She'd do it without blinking an eye, with zero regrets as long as she knew she was setting Star up for a successful mission, or to not die herself. The only real sign that there was emotional turmoil, on the outside anyways, was her jaw muscles flexing when she clenched and resisted grinding her teeth. "No death." She agreed, after a much more pregnant pause than the comment deserved to what would be Amelia's point of view. The thing was, Star would be able to see that Ellesandra didn't truly believe what she was saying. Oh, she fully meant no death for Star, but for herself? She might be careful to not upset Star with her death, but if it came down to it death for her was still an option. One which she wasn't as against as she should be, in all honesty. But Ellesandra didn't want to dwell on that topic, or that thought or emotion, and knew that Star could see it. So instead, she involved Amelia in the conversation. "Amelia, do you happen to know of any potential leads on...making money? Considering Star has a great ability with healing and - well, I can absorb magic if it's necessary. That sometimes helps with curses, for example, or cursed items."
Star Lumina	Star wasn't happy with what she saw. It frightened her. Terrified her. It was the sort of passive suicidal acceptance that truly had the capacity to let Ellesandra make a martyr of themselves, and Star was juuuuuuuuust stubborn enough to get some dangerous ideas on the matter. That the two of them could theoretically end up in a fight against one another for who was going to ultimately sacrifice for the other was absurd, and something Star had to push from her mind only because she knew that either of them sacrificing wasn't the answer, but she struggled to find a way in her mind to explain that to Ellesandra in a way that made sense and addressed the deep emotional turmoil that the knight felt. And though Ellesandra was pulling a so very typical distraction into their conversation, Star wasn't going to let it go without the last word. She squeezed their hand tighter and said, quietly, but firmly: "No. Death." Two words that had the unspoken implication of acknowledging what she saw in Ellesandra. Amelia, not hearing what Star said, responded naturally to Ellesandra's question. "I'd say you could make good money joining the Followers of Myst, but I've gotten the sense from you both that that's not really your cup of tea. Sooooo...In lieu of that, if you want work here in Myst, there's options for that. There's probably some contacts that captain has in all sorts of planes that could set you up on that front, buuuuut...Somehow I doubt going somewhere that isn't Gurhal is what you're looking for." She then shrugged. "And I've never been to Gurhal, so Star is gonna know way better than me what making money looks like there."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked at Star with the squeeze and the words. She didn't argue, didn't respond to it, but you didn't even have to be Star with her specific Aura magic to read that her silence was an attempt not to rock the boat, not because she agreed with Star. It was, in many ways, her literal job to sacrifice herself for Star. And even if it wasn't her job, there was the depression and it lending to her feeling specifically that Star's life was worth more than hers. Hell, a lot of people's lives were worth more than hers, in her eyes. So there was essentially a silent agreement not to say anything or argue about it, but she didn't really agree to the no death. She wouldn't do something to get herself killed if she could avoid it, but she was comfortable accepting it too. That darkness didn't leave, the thoughts now brought up, as she turned to listen to Amelia entirely. She frowned at the thought of joining the Followers of Myst, at least before their mission with Star and finding Aurora was complete. A shake of her head was given at that. "If Amara is sending us to different planes than Gurhal for jobs I'm not sure that would behoove us, considering the urgency of the mission and the potential longevity of such a mission as that." She turned back to look at Star. "Any ideas?" Again, keeping the conversation off of that darkness. She was sure Star would bring it up later, when they were alone, but she was at least buying herself more time without it now.
Star Lumina	"Oh, uh.." Amelia began again. "Amara wouldn't be your captain unless you were specifically part of the First Crusaders. Most Followers of Myst do not organize into teams like that and act independently or with their own adventuring groups. The Frist Crusaders are a specific group within the guild with a specific purpose. As it stands, there's a very present objective to go to Gurhal, enough that I'm sure Serenity will send us, or if not us then some other people, with you. Though obviously choosing two guild members with rapport makes way more sense than two random people," she said with a shrug. Star was tactful enough to not push the issue here in public, but the look on her face was definitely a 'we'll talk about this later' sort of thing, as the knight expected. When asked for any ideas, she gently shook her head. "Like I said. We can start our journey in the star plane if we have the option and go to Hotenz city. Our ultimate goal is the moon plane, and there would be work there to do, too, but the concentration of work would be highest in Hotenz. As would the availability of resources. I believe the Guardians have their central guild hall there, too." Another name, another guild. Commonplace enough; the elven settlement they had taken refuge in was more than likely part of the Emerald Enclave, too. The balance of acquiring resources against time was a difficult one.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra may have misunderstood something Amelia said, but it didn't matter. As Star laid out the plan for it, Ellesandra nodded. "Well, I'll be by you wherever you decide to go Star. Just point me in the right direction." She relented in regards to going to somewhere to make money first. She'd follow Star on her mission; she hadn't been hired to make the decisions on what to do or where to go. She'd been 'hired' as a guard, so she'd guard Star. If that included going and doing...whatever they were going to do in Hotenz for money, then she'd do it. She looked over to Star again and then squeezed her hand one more time, before turning her attention back to the training grounds. "Sorry for interrupting your studies. Have we found anything?" Bringing them back to the topic as well. She didn't have much more to say, since their plans were pretty well made out in regards to where they were going next.
Star Lumina	Star gave a peculiar look at Ellesandra. "I'm not going to claim to know the best way forward. I'd much rather have your input on the matter, too," she said as she squeezed back and turned back to her books. The question of having found anything had Amelia speaking up: "So far what I've found is that Gurhal is shielded by a magical cipher. It's not entirely unheard of, Myst itself uses a similar sort of magic to protect itself from otherworld invaders. Illithids and the like. Also why your cards to get here are bound to you, so they can't be stolen and used to breach the veil." Amelia then gave a moment of pause. "...Trouble is, the way it's described sounds like it's not just a matter of having been there to be able to go there again. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if Star knew how to breach this cipher, she'd already have made a portal to get back there a long time ago," she said, looking to Star. Star gave a slightly embarrassed smile and a rub of the back of her head. "It was my mother who sent me away from Gurhal, as a matter of emergency. It's not like planar travel was something I was capable of at the time. I've figured out the basics since then, but a cipher..." she looked a little downcast at the notion. A roadblock she felt was going to take a long time for her to be able to cross. Years, even. "Don't worry," said Amelia. "I can figure it out. I just might need to confer with someone." She paused for a moment. "...Professor Yami is from Aetheria. There's similar magic there, so he might be helpful in breaking the cipher more swiftly."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded to the input request. She had given her input though, and didn't really have much more input to give. Her eyes stayed on the training ground below while they spoke of the different ciphers and struggles with opening a portal to Gurhal. Ellesandra was listening still, but she was distracting a little bit of that darkness, and the dread of having that conversation with Star later, by watching the fights. When there was confirmation that Professor Yami might be able to help Amelia decipher it, she looked back up to Amelia. "Anything we can do to assist in that?" Ellesandra remembered Professor Yami as that magic professor who had wiped the floor with his students. Professionally and educationally, of course, but still. He had seemed impressive, and Amelia certainly seemed to look up to him. If there was something they needed to do to help, she would - but also she knew they were strangers, guests in this realm right now, and them just staying out of the way was an entirely valid thing for them to have to do. Her hands clasped in front of her tightly, the feeling of restlessness at just waiting bubbling up a little, but mostly being ignored.
Star Lumina	Amelia gently shrugged her shoulders. "Unless you have some immensely powerful magical artifact sitting in your pocket I doubt there's a way to get his attention professionally. I don't really have the clout to seek him out, nor anything to offer that would be significant enough. Not that it'd be impossible to convince him to help out of the goodness of his heart I suppose, but...It's just how things tend to go here that you'll get more from others if you have something to offer in turn. It'd be different if we were friends or something, but, nyeh...Best connection I have is that my brother is a student of Professor Chamberlain, and she seems to have a rapport with Professor Yami. But I'd wager fifty gold pieces that my brother just slacks off in her classes and chases tail more than he studies her lessons. So...Not feeling like that's the best angle." Amelia looked at the other two, as if wondering if any of what she said sparked any ideas in the knight or auramancer. There might be a few options to consider, though as charismatic as Star was, appealing to the man's better nature seemed risky. Not that it didn't seem like Amelia could figure things out on her own, but it might accelerate things if they could enlist more help. Truly, their quest in general would get easier the more allies they could acquire.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra glanced at Star, then back to Amelia. "Maybe not an artifact, but we both have pretty unique styles of magic he might be interested in. Not that you have to share if you aren't comfortable with that, Star." She offered Star a reassuring smile, but then back down to the training grounds, considering options. "Professor Chamberlain might actually be more interested in my magic than Professor Yami is, but I'm not sure if information on any of that would be enough to gain you an audience." She tilted her head back and forth, thinking about potentials with the gem that they still had, and then there was a light bulb, like someone knocked her in the back of the head to remind her of something. She turned her attention back to Star. "Do you think the tarot card might work? I haven't looked at it since coming to Myst, I assumed the limitations of Myst's magic would effect it, so it's in my pack back in the room. But you said there was some very powerful magic in it."
Star Lumina	There was a mild pang of jealousy at what Ellesandra said. The notion of professor Chamberlain being interested in Ellesandra at all made her heart turn into a wild gremlin and gnaw at her to say something really dumb about it. She didn't, naturally, and managed to not show any sign of that flash of what amounted to fear in the face of Ellesandra being around that other woman they found attractive. When Ellesandra brought up the card, that had her expression raising in turn. She nodded. "Mn, it's certainly affected by the magic suppression here, so the magic is kinda dormant, but I mean...You ought to be able to feel its power, too, if you concentrate on it. It's...Immense." This, naturally, had Amelia quite interested as well. "Well...If you want to show me, I can see if it might be the sort of thing that would be on his level. Might be something he'd want to take a look at, for sure, if it's as powerful as you say." A notion that had Star looking a little relieved. One part due to not having to visit the woman Ellesandra was attracted to, and one part due to not having to talk about her magic and make a fool of herself with how her magic resisted natural explanations. It was hard to just...Talk about it. Ellesandra could understand it because Ellesandra had FELT her magic. But for Star to put it into words? The idea of her standing before a lecture hall made her want to hide under several layers of blankets and curl into herself.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't notice any of the jealousy, still assuming her previous bad mood had been due to something she'd read in one of the books. Instead though, she nodded at the idea of the card's power being an option. She was a little hesitant to show Amelia, only because it felt...personal. There was some trepidation at letting Amelia in on just how much her inner mind was defeated. How much turmoil there was going on in her. She hadn't had a choice with Star, because Star could just see it. Amelia couldn't, and this would be actively inviting her into that knowledge. It didn't mean she had to explain everything, but it certainly still brought some trepidation about it. Her hands wrung together for a moment while she thought, but eventually she would nod. It was necessary to ensure they got to their destination in a timely manner, and releasing some of her personal privacy for that goal was worth it. "If you come back to the room with us, I can get it out for you. It was given to me by a stranger, so I was quite suspicious of it until Star did an examination of it and ensured me it wasn't cursed or negative in any ways."
Star Lumina	Amelia was dumbfounded. "...A complete stranger just...Gives you a magical card of immense power? For no reason?" she asked, making sure she had the details correct, because it sounded...Absurd. "Fuck me.." she muttered. "What is with you two? Where's my random magical artifact of incredible power?" she continued to mutter just below her breath, not intending for either of the others to hear her. She kept on, in a more conversation volume. "Yes, I'd like to see it. And I sure as hell don't blame you for being suspicious, given those circumstance. Ready to head out then?" she asked. Star gathered her books, then nodded as Amelia did the same, still having an incredulous look about her. She was nearly at the point of resigning herself to just...Not question this stuff anymore.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra let out a soft snort-chuckle. "You and I are on the same page there, Amelia. Ever since I met Star, weird stuff has been happening." She would nod as well though, moving to stand and doing a quick sweep of the area with her eyes to see if anyone was moving or adjusting with their own movements. Any sign of someone preparing to also leave, just 'happening' to be at the same time as them or anything like that. It was important to keep an eye on potential trails they had, if they had one for any reason. "If it helps, she implied that she just felt the need to do it, as if it was something she didn't really have control of. I don't believe in destiny, but if you do, then it'd be that type of thing." Ellesandra added for Amelia's benefit, taking a step back to allow the two mages to walk ahead with Ellesandra falling behind. Ellesandra would, as well, lightly touch Star's back briefly. Just a soft touch as they began walking, a reassurance again, before she went back to her normal following patterns without touching Star.
Star Lumina	Amelia let out a dejected sigh. She didn't much believe in destiny, but she also couldn't chalk up half the stuff that was happening to these two as just coincidence. It was too coincidental. Nobody just...Had all these things happen to them. There was nobody who seemed interested in the group of three as they stood, nobody happening to just be leaving at the same time. They really did seem to just be one among many in this place, and the population of this observation room was sparse already. The paranoia certainly had Ellesandra looking for the right things, if there was someone. But there truly, truly did not seem to be anyone who had any interest or business with the trio. Once they exited, a passerby happened to recognize Amelia, but all that did was just scare the young male student into stepping aside and away from Amelia - something that had happened more than once since they arrived. Amelia certainly wasn't just some nobody in this place, even if she clearly was also not among the ranks of the elites of Myst. Star gave a warm, appreciative smile over her shoulder when feeling the touch on her back. It was a gesture that clearly helped lift her spirits. The physical touch was important to her, that much had been obvious for a long while. The walk back to the guild hall was otherwise uneventful, and they returned to their room where the books were then dropped off neatly on the bedside table in two stacks while allowing Ellesandra to get this mysterious card from their pack.
Ellesandra	Just because they were in a supposedly safe space did not mean she would take her job any less seriously. As soon as you started to slack, it was your fault if something happened you missed - this had been drilled into her by Sia over, and over. And then the punishment for slacking once still had scars on her back. She watched the student who stood to the side as they passed, but dismissed him once they'd passed and he wasn't near. It was interesting the influence Amelia seemed to have, despite not being an elite. And her brother was one of the students in the class earlier? Or maybe just one of the classes, not the one earlier. Either way, that intrigued Ellesandra a little. The quiet walk back to the guild hall was good, and when they got into their room she moved over to her pack. A bit of rustling as she opened one of the side pockets, and then she pulled out the tarot card that she'd been given. If it hadn't changed at all since arriving in Myst, it would still be at that 3/4ths defeated, 1/4th victorious state. If it had changed any in Myst, it would be just a bit less defeated, though still close to that fourth for victorious. A minor adjustment, but a little bit of one to recognize her having opened up a little to Star. Even if she still didn't accept it, and she still had that darkness there, it had been progress. She hesitated again, trepidation and shame settling in her stomach for a moment, before she turned the card over to Amelia while actively not meeting her eyes.
Star Lumina	The card indeed had moved for Ellesandra. Slightly more of the victorious side was now showing. It was noticeable. When it was handed to Amelia, she gently took the card and peered curiously at it. A subtle swell of magic formed in her palms; it had been seen on multiple occasions that magic was still possible in Myst. Many were seen using it, and not just in specific areas. Amelia was one such person who seemed permitted to use it, though if Ellesandra ever thought to ask, the truth of the matter was that guild members of the Followers of Myst were permitted to use magic to a certain degree, and that freedom rose with one's contribution and trust within Myst. "Huh. Half and half...Triumph or defeat. Name changes based on how you look at it.." she muttered to herself, something that might affirm to Ellesandra that others did see the card only as it was initially. Straight down the middle. Only Ellesandra could see how it had shifted. Amelia studied it for a short time, going slowly more pale in her face, to the point that her fingers were ever so slightly trembling while holding the card. "Just...Who was it that gave this to you, Ellesandra?" asked Amelia, her voice showing a clear...Intimidation. Fear, almost. "You're not...Able to use the magic in this, are you? Just...In general?"
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was put on guard by just how much Amelia seemed intimidated and fearful of the card. Her hand went to her rapier casually, now concerned the card might be 'bad' in some way shape or form that Star might have missed. "Her name was Freya. She said something about being from somewhere called a Spire. She just happened to be in a tavern we were staying at, and when I went down to get our breakfast she was watching me. When I approached, she'd drawn this with magic, and explained that the card 'needed' to be drawn." Ellesandra had subtly shifted to stand between Amelia, the card, and Star, placing herself between Star and the potential danger. Amelia's reaction was definitely causing her caution, and she was prepared to respond quickly if somehow the card just...blew up, or summoned something bad. Could Freya have been working with the Cult of Faust, and/or Black Diamond somehow? If the tarot card was tracking them or doing something negative to them, it was good that Amelia was looking at it now.
Star Lumina	Amelia went ghostly white with Ellesandra's explanation, though it was less fear and more...Once more, dumbfounded shock as her eyes fluttered. "The Spire? As in...The Lost Spire? As in, the realm that nobody has ever even been able to confirm exists? As in the realm with the tower said to present the ultimate challenge and thusly the greatest reward in all the multiverse, the power to defy the gods, to shape reality to your will, to have anything and everything you want if you do not succumb to its trials? THAT Spire? And what, this Freya girl just happened to like the way your hair looked that morning and decided HEY let's give this person a card that contains enough magic to BLOW UP all of Faerun if she is feeling particularly testy that day?" she went on, sighing, then slapping a hand to her forehead. "Sorry. Look," she said, handing the card back to Ellesandra as she noticed how tense they were getting. "It's not...Bad. It's not gonna hurt you. But there are not words potent enough to explain to you how powerful the magic within it is. The best I can say is that if you've ever wanted to punch someone so hard you cracked reality itself in half, that's your ticket to it. But...Like Star had said, there's a lock on that magic just as strong as the magic it's containing. The whole thing is dormant while in Myst anyway, but you need to...Make absolutely sure, without a shadow of a doubt, that this thing...Never...Ever ends up in the hands of someone who aims to do bad things. Because whoever figures out how to unlock its power...Could make an entire realm kneel before them, or be obliterated. Tch..." She then muttered: "Just happened to be staying in the same tavern...Fuck's sake.."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra wasn't sure how she felt about this explanation. That much magic in it? She eyed the card. Star had said it was really powerful, but she hadn't expected it to be deity level powerful. "She-" There was a pause. Did she tell Amelia that there was a way to unlock it? That the power would supposedly help her somehow, once one side of her internal conflict won out over the other? Ellesandra didn't trust well, and she glanced over to Star. They were going to be having Amelia and Amara as allies, weren't they? And Amelia was helping them find a way to Star's home plane. After another moment of trepidation, she continued. "The half and half isn't half when I look at it. The lock will be undone once one side fully takes up the card, based on...personal things. She implied that the power in it would give me...something. I'm not sure what kind of power, and it probably depends on which side 'wins', so to speak. So, there is a potential unlock to that power. Just not one that has happened yet."
Star Lumina	Star hadn't quite the propensity for colourful language as much as Amelia. If it wasn't such a serious moment, Star might have giggled at the choice of words. But to know it was all coming from some place, from some person, who was somehow connected to such a powerful thing, it just reinforced that there had been a lot of...Focus on the two of them. A lot of people far, far more powerful than either of them were taking interest in what she thought was truly just a simple quest of her getting, to put it mildly, a tiny bit lost and just wanting to go home. It troubled Star, making her worry that there was far more to this than just her desire to see her mother again. Why did other people care? It made troublesome feelings swell in her chest again, feelings that she wished she had just been born a normal farm girl with a pretty horse and some chickens to look after. That sounded nice. Ultimately, she nodded to Ellesandra when they looked at her for affirmation. She believed they could trust Amelia. And when the explanation went on, Star's heart dropped. She obviously knew what 'personal things' meant. So it was...The guilt, the grief, Ellesandra's own personal turmoil that the card was representing? And it had the ability to empower them, depending on which side won out? It made her...Fearful for what might happen if the dark side, the defeated side won. She was tempted to ask what Ellesandra saw when they looked, but...She had a feeling she already knew. Amelia drew in a slow breath, then huffed, some colour returning to her face. "Well...If that's how it is, then it sounds like it's bound to you, that you're the only one who can use it. So I hope to the nine hells and back that you're not secretly harbouring some plans of world domination." A half-joking remark. There certainly was the potential that THAT much power could corrupt anyone into doing something that created a terrible future for a lot of people. Amelia folded her arms, assuming Ellesandra took the card back. "I won't pry into whatever...'Personal things' means. But...If what I know about the Lost Spire has ANYTHING to do with it...It's a test. A test of you. The legends go that anyone who faces the Lost Spire will face the ultimate challenge of their life, something that tests one's moral compass, their mettle, their compassion, their empathy, their selflessness, determination, conviction...Everything about them. And for those facing the Lost Spire's trials, failure to surpass those trials means death. And success, well...Though it may surprise you to hear, there's not exactly a journal in the archives that tells a first hand account of Grognard the farmer who waltzed through the tower of a thousand floors and gained ultimate power and then told everyone 'hey I'm your new god'. Something like that would...Kinda make waves enough for us all to know about it, I'd wager.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra felt a smirk tug at her lips at Amelia's joking remark. "Dominating the world? The only thing-" She paused in her comment. She wasn't sure how Amelia would respond to the joke, and she knew for a fact her next words would have made Star blush up a storm. She glanced over to Star, amusement flicking even more at imagining how she'd react if Ellesandra finished that and said that the only thing she'd be dominating was the women in her bed. Not that Ellesandra necessarily played too much in that area, but it was one of those jokes that almost slipped out simply from feeling comfortable with people. That was...an odd feeling now that she thought about it. Either way, she shook her head. "I've been led to believe no matter which side wins I'll get some sort of power. But I don't particularly trust magic like this so...I have no desire to be a deity, that is for certain. Deities can all die for all I care, let mortals rule themselves." She paused, realizing that might have been a bit extreme. "Not that I'd use this magic to do so." She clarified, looking at Amelia so she didn't think Ellesandra was about to go on a deific genocide or anything with the power in the card. She cleared her throat, and then looked back over to Star and reached out again. A squeeze to Star's arm, so she also knew that Ellesandra wasn't planning on doing that. Star knew more of how dark Ellesandra's emotions were right now, but she wanted - no, needed - Star to trust her not to do something like that.
Star Lumina	There was an almost comical innocence on Star's face as Ellesandra failed to complete that joke and it sailed clean, far, and swift like a meteor in the night's sky waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over Star's head. She just blinked, the question mark all but visible above her head. Amelia, meanwhile, rose both brows. Oh, SHE got where Ellesandra was about to go with that, though she had no way to know of Ellesandra's sexuality, so the person being dominated was of indeterminate form. So, Ellesandra topped, huh? That was ammo for later. Star certainly saw merit to Ellesandra's way of thinking, though death still was something she didn't like to think about. That aside, freedom from influence and others impairing one's free will was something that Star certainly could get behind. There was trust in her that didn't need to be reaffirmed, but Star clearly appreciated it anyway. A nod was given, electing to just drop the other matter of whatever Ellesandra was going to say before. Star did have a thought, however. "Do you think it might be able to...Bring someone back to life?" asked Star to Amelia, not entirely sure if she wanted to know the answer to it herself. "In the event that something tragic happens, I mean," she clarified. Of course, her mind went to this mysterious M.K. person for Ellesandra but...There were other potential uses. If she herself died. If her mother was found dead. A contingency for such things, perhaps. Amelia gently nodded. "Could be. Hard to say if that's the shape the magic will take but...The force of power is there. True Resurrection is, I might even go so far as to say, almost a waste of the potential power, if it's a one time thing. But I can see why one might pick that over other uses."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was taken entirely off guard by Star's question. She stiffened and straightened, eyes flicking from Star to Amelia at the comment that resurrection was a true possibility. The thought obviously brought Marigold to mind, and that was enough to make Ellesandra entirely freeze up. The idea of resurrecting her had been brought up with her parents soon after she'd died. She didn't remember why they couldn't - well, more she wasn't really told why they couldn't and she was in too much of a 'state' to have the clarify of mind to ask. But if this card could do so? Grief, hope, shame, all conflicted within her at the idea. Anger shot up at Amelia just callously saying that resurrection would be a waste, but it was quickly taken up instead with grief. The grief struggled heavily and Ellesandra's obviously tensed posture turned away from the two women to put her pack back in the corner. She did not put the card in it again, slipping it into her legging pocket again at the comment about how powerful it was. There was a...numb feeling coming over her now. An overwhelmed response, where she emotionally had no idea how to process the idea of bringing Marigold back, and between the heavy emotions she'd felt the past few days and this, it was just her subconscious going 'okay that's enough'. Disassociating almost, though she still felt in her body and in control. "So, what's the next step?" Focus on work. Get that done. She could investigate this possibility, these emotions, another time.
Star Lumina	Star saw the grief, the shame, the hope. She loved the idea of hope. She loved the idea of Ellesandra getting a chance to undo the pain. Star knew that if it was her mother, she would want that chance. If she had power to do whatever she wanted, and her mother was dead? Reviving them so she could be with them again was a choice she'd make without thought. But she didn't want to promise false hope. That would be more crushing than anything. "So there's no way to know what shape it will take I suppose," she said, words meant to give context to the power, meant to not declare it a sure thing. Amelia nodded. "Aye. Not until the lock is broken and it reveals itself. Based on what Ellesandra said, it sounds like it could take one of two possible paths. I was just remarking on its potential strength." An explanation cut short by Ellesandra asking what was next. Star looked at them with sympathy, but she knew now wasn't the time. Amelia looked at Ellesandra. "What comes next is...Well, I guess it's up to you. We should find Professor Yami, but whether you feel the best option is to show him what you showed me, or take another approach, is up to you. Either way...We have to find him. Best bet is to check with Serenity to see what the teaching schedule looks like, see if he is giving a lecture. If not, could have him requested to come to the main office. Either way," she said, nudging with her head for the others to follow. Assuming they did, the trip was uneventful to be back at the main library services area, where Serenity was seated behind her desk with all manner of operational things happening behind her, books stacked in specific spots, and stacks of parchment looking to be sorted and processed. So very much bureaucracy to keep this city running, and Serenity seemed to be at the head of a lot of it. At least, the library part of it. Amelia took the lead, letting Serenity know what they needed, and it would prove to be that Professor Yami was in a lecture for the next thirty minutes, with the specific lecture hall being noted, which ultimately left Amelia, Star, and Ellesandra then having to go to the lecture halls. A place of similarly rigid and logical design to access them, it was a series of main hallways divided by logical discipline. It became a junction of sorts, squared to have one able to traverse along a main series of horizontal corridors that connected on either end with those familiar teleportation rooms that had various connecting options, with vertical halls up and down off the horizontal ones splitting off in different disciplines of magic. These were busier hallways, but there seemed a logical flow of foot traffic to reach the desired area. Artifice, naturally, was their destination, with the vertical hall having doors on either side leading to different lecture halls for different professors. Their ultimate goal was the lecture hall for Professor. A. Yami. But whether the trio was to enter and sit through another fifteen minutes of actual lecturing or if Ellesandra preferred to wait for everyone else to clear out before entering to speak to the man in question, was left up to the knight.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded to Amelia, pointedly not looking at Star. She knew Star could see her emotions. Could she see the numbness? What did that look like? Either way, Ellesandra would follow along. To the library, to get his schedule. To the lecture hall, walking through the halls with a lot less of a focus than she normally did. Oh, she was still on guard, keeping an eye out for anyone following or anyone looking at them oddly, or anyone who got too close. But she was not being actively mindful of the terrain, the layout. She wasn't mapping the way back to the entrance in her mind in case they needed to escape for some reason, like she normally would have been. The numbness had spread to the point that once they got to the lecture hall, she'd looked towards the other two in confusion as to why they had stopped. It took a moment for her to realize the lecture was still ongoing, and Ellesandra would elect to wait until the class was over. Interrupting a lecture didn't sound like a good way to make this professor like them or more inclined to help out. She would position them so that they were mostly out of the way, and that she would be between Star and any of the students coming out of the lecture hall. She kept her eye out for the professor she'd seen earlier in the training grounds, or if he didn't walk out with or after the students, would step in to see if he was still in there, packing up or anything. She was about to motion Amelia forward, but remembered Amelia said she'd never really had any dealings with him, and that she didn't exactly have sway over gaining his attention. So, Ellesandra would approach him instead, clearing her throat and again, focusing on the goal. The mission. "Excuse me, Professor?"
Star Lumina	Amelia and Star followed the direction given, waiting off to the side. A bit of time passed, the flood of students left the hall, and then the group poured in. The lecture hall was as one might expect. Entrance at the top of it, with a few sets of stairs that intersected rows of seats behind long wooden desks that were perfectly measured to stretch between the space provided by the staircases. Ordered and logical, as Myst tended to be. At the base of the stairs was the area where the professor himself stood, donning the same black cloak with leather gloves such that only the skin on his face was visible. Pale complexion matched against dark hair. He turned, when addressed, and folded his hands behind his back as he looked at Ellesandra, as if trying to recall if he'd seen her face before. "Hm? How can I help you, miss?" His eyes narrowed a little. "Not a face I recognize, so I suppose you're not here with follow up questions on how one properly enchants iron to prepare it to seat and contain empowered gemstones, mn?" A smile upon his face answered his own question. Of course that wasn't why they were here. He patiently waited for the answer from the knight.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was doubly on guard while all of the students came out, but as the Professor addressed her, and confirmed that she wasn't a student, Ellesandra shook her head. "No Sir." She had gone into her more professional, respectful demeanor. A low nod of her head was given to him in respect before she spoke. "My companion is looking to find a way to open a portal to a realm that has a strong magical cipher. Miss Amelia here is helping us out, but she suggested that you may be able to provide the best and quickest assistance in cracking this cipher." Ellesandra certainly got straight to the point after the polite hello. She slipped her fingers into her leggings, and pulled out the tarot card. "I was also advised that you were particularly interested in powerful magical artifacts, and might be willing to lend us your time in such if we were willing to let you examine a unique, powerful artifact. If you aren't already busy?" Ellesandra certainly wasn't an expert negotiator. She wasn't great with people, she was straight to the point and offered what they had in exchange for what they wanted. She was a straight shooter, so in hindsight maybe Amelia or Star should have taken the lead in this.
Star Lumina	The professor, Akarus being his given name that had yet to be given, kept his respectful posture as he was addressed. A brow rose at the mention of powerful magical artifacts. He then looked at Amelia, who was bowing her head in reverence. All the information was taken in and processed, and all the while the man maintained a charming smile. He certainly seemed pleasant. Trustworthy, at a glance. Perhaps a little...Silver-tongued; his smile had a roguish tint to it that was hard to discern if it was just playfully amused or something else. But if there was anything worthy of distrust, Star wasn't speaking up about it. "Artifice, hence, artifacts, are in fact my specialty," he began. "Miss...Amelia, of the First Crusaders, has good cause to suspect as she does, and all the reason to be aware of my exploits given it is the mission of her sect of the Followers of Myst to acquire the very artifacts that Myst keeps in its collections, and thusly has persons like me seek to understand and...When possible, replicate. My home plane of Aetheria has similar magics that ward it, so I am familiar," he explained, then looked back at the card. "What is it you have for me here? There are certainly things I could busy myself with but...If you have something of particular uniqueness, it does shove all that busywork down the priorities table, doesn't it?" he said, not reaching for the card, but asking Ellesandra to explain, or perhaps hand it to him if she was so inclined to have him figure things out himself. "You might also tell me what plane it is you speak of. Why, there is a non-zero chance I already know how to get there, being something of a planar vagabond at times myself in search of things strange, unique, and mysterious."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra took in a deep breath when he confirmed he had things to do that could be 'pushed back for something interesting'. Part of her disliked this answer, but she wasn't going to show that. The distaste was ignored as she turned the Tarot card so that he could see it, albeit from a bit away. "A woman named Freya, from a Spire, gave me this card. Only I am able to see the change in it, in how the split down the middle moves based on my internal struggle. And from what she told me, it would provide some form of power or boon once once side has fully taken up the card. Upon receiving it, I had my companion Miss Star Lumina here look at it and she confirmed there was powerful magic in it, but it wasn't of any danger to us." She briefly glanced over to Amelia, then back to the Professor. "Miss Amelia has implied that this power is much more than we realized, enough to do....a lot, once it is unlocked and accessible. She also implied it might be related to something called the Lost Spire, and a trial of sorts for it." That was probably enough to catch his attention, right? She still held onto the card, careful that he couldn't just reach out and snap it from her. "As for our destination, it is the plane Gurhal. Star can give you more information on a more specific location within the plane, if that is needed."
Star Lumina	Akarus kept his hands folded politely behind his back. He listened closely to what they had to say, eyes occasionally flicking to Amelia, then to Star, as attention was drawn to each. The words 'Lost Spire' brought up some interest in his eyes. "Ah, the Lost Spire, is it? It's been a few years since I'd delved into that little...Pocket of mystery. There was another guild here in Myst for a while you know. Seekers of the Spire they called themselves, led by one Luna Everflame. She went in search of this place but...It's been oh...Two years or so since anyone's heard from her? Something like that? The guild all but fell apart in her absence, but it is all to say that particular mystery is one that has caught the attention of many here in Myst over the years. Plenty of materials to pour over in the archives, should your curiosity lead you to them. But it sounds like...You have your own little slice of the Spire here, in the form of this card, yes?" he said, still keeping his posture polite and respectful, not making motion to try and take it from her in the slightest. "You might have people who were interested to hear about this...Freya woman. So they might try and seek her, vain as that attempt might be for someone with such powers as she. Curious that you were given a card that has powers, however...The understanding I've come to is that while there is, in some way, and involvement of such cards in the trials of the Spire, they are said only to have power within that realm. Perhaps this Freya is able to circumvent those rules a little.." he mused aloud. "But I trust Miss. Wysperwick's assessment of it," he said, looking to Amelia. They hadn't given their surname before, but there it was. "The question I have, then...Is what do you intend on doing with the power, once it's unlocked?"
Ellesandra	She was feeling a little uncomfortable with how calm this man was in this information, compared to how Amelia had reacted to it. The reveal of Amelia's surname did cause Ellesandra to glance towards the woman, but it was only briefly. Her discomfort led to her, now that the card had been shown, lowering it back down to slip into her pocket. Just a little bit safer than it just being held out overall. "I'm afraid I'm not comfortable sharing information about Freya. I have no desire to have her dealing with people seeking her out in hopes of fortune or power." She said, then shook her head. The power question was conflicting. Part of her wanted to say she could resurrect Marigold, but she didn't. Not only did they not know how the power would manifest, but Ellesandra also wasn't really sure if that was the right use of it. Would Marigold want to be resurrected, this long after her death, so far away from her homeland? No matter how much Ellesandra would like her to still be alive, it didn't change that she HAD died. And unless the card could change time itself, simply resurrecting her wouldn't fix that. "I don't particularly want power, Sir. I'd rather this type of thing not be complicating mine and Star's mission, plus we are unable to identify in what form the power will show itself, so I can't honestly tell you what I would do with it if I ever do get it." She paused, then added. "I have no goals of goddesshood or ruling anyone. At most, I would use the power to better protect my charge, as is my duty, and ensure we are able to find her mother like we are set out to look for."
Star Lumina	Akarus gave a bit of a pause. Something Ellesandra had said seemed to resonate with him. Though Ellesandra might not see it, Star's face softened, and a bit of sorrow came over her. "...Lost her mother, has she?" said Akarus, a bit more somber than before, still maintaining his professional air about him. He then turned to his desk, plucked the quill that was resting in the inkwell upon it, and grabbed some spare parchment that was also laid on his desk. He was busy with this for a time, writing what appeared to be a particularly complex series of...Something or other upon it. He then raised his free, gloved hand and flicked his wrist down at the parchment, which had a small tuff of flame hit the page and rather immediately dry the inks. He then folded the parchment and held it out towards Amelia. "Miss. Wysperwick, please do see that you aide these two in attuning one of the gates of Myst to Gurhal. You'll find the sigil sequence upon this parchment. Do commit it to memory, and destroy the parchment when you have done so." An ominous set of instructions, which also revealed that this man knew the way to Star's home from the onset of their conversation. He didn't look interested in talking further, however, even if it was about this card of such immense power he had been so interested in moments before. "If that is quite all, I have teaching obligations to fulfil."
Ellesandra	She didn't speak or add anything, since it didn't seem like he was needing any other information. She considered correcting him in that Star hadn't lost her mother, only that they'd been separated and were on a rescue mission, essentially. Then again, making that clarification didn't seem to be necessary. So, she stood there awkwardly as he wrote something on paper, not wanting to interrupt and glancing towards Amelia while he did so. She wasn't sure if this was normal or not. The confirmation that he was giving Amelia the sigil sequence, though, sent a brief shock of excitement through Ellesandra. That was much easier than she'd been expecting, that they just got whatever sigils would be needed then? The fact he didn't ask to look at the card any more confused her, since she'd understood he might want to study it from Amelia. Still, she wouldn't complain. When he politely dismissed them, she lowered her head to him. "Thank you, Professor." She would glance again to Amelia to follow her lead on how they were going to leave or if they needed to say or do anything else before doing so. And her hand reached out, squeezing Star's arm again. Progress.
Star Lumina	Akarus gave a curt, professional nod at the thanks. He understood what was meant, 'lost' as in separated. It evoked the response all the same; a correction would have just been met with clarification that he didn't need a correction. Amelia, meanwhile, had to take a second before accepting the parchment. She looked...Very confused. Beyond confused. It didn't take an auramancer to see, nor did it take a genius to put together that whatever just happened there was not even close to normal. Star had looked a little sorrowful when Ellesandra grabbed her arm, but she looked at them and smiled all the same. It was a sad smile. She saw something sad. But they had made progress indeed. Once they had left the lecture hall again, Star had a moment of contemplation, looking around them. "...I suppose it'll be our last night here in Myst, then," she said, a little sad about that fact. They could come back, but...Would they? It remained to be seen. It had felt nice, sleeping in a warm bed, in a safe place. A break from the constant fighting to survive. The time had passed to sunset with all their travels, so evening meals and preparations were on the agenda. Amelia was left in some measure of stunned silence, but also had buried her face in the sigil sequence provided, hurriedly trying to do as asked and follow orders from the professor. She still led them around, and had presence of mind to watch so as to not bump into anyone else, but still was clearly occupied as they set their sights on getting back to the guild hall for the evening.
Ellesandra	Well, that was odd. She watched Amelia's obvious confusion and surprise at how things turned out, but followed out and began heading back to the guild hall while Amelia buried her face in the notes. She knew better than to try to disturb a magic nerd who was mid-study in something they were interested or focused on, so she instead turned her attention to Star. "If we are to leave tomorrow, then yes. Is there anything you would like to do before we go?" She offered this, not knowing if she could really follow through with it. That was the painful thing about being reliant on Amara and Amelia to get them back into the guild hall, if they decided to go out and do something. Amelia especially looked like she might be busy with the notes for a little bit. Still, if there was something Star would like to do, she would offer it and see how she could make it work. The caged feelings burned, even as her denial reasoned that she wanted to do make sure Star had a good last evening in Myst because it was her duty as a guard to ensure the safety, and happiness, of her charge. It was an excuse that told herself on the conscious level, but in reality, that cage around her feelings just...wasn't really caging well.
Star Lumina	Star wasn't sure how to respond to the question. On the one hand, there were a trillion things she wanted to do in Myst. There didn't seem to be an excess of touristy things to do, sights to see beyond the athenaeum itself, but there was something magical - literally - about this floating cloud city in its own pocket of the multiverse. She thought about the question. They had gone out and had fun shopping for clothes, which was in itself something Star found wholly enjoyable, and the pleasant memories of how Ellesandra had looked at her in her new magical outfit were still in her mind. She envisioned herself doing something, anything in Myst, and the reality of it all was just...No matter what it was, her vision of it didn't see her doing it alone. It was, all of it, done together, with Ellesandra at her side. Smiling in her vision, even if she knew the knight to be wholly stoic more often than not. So when she found the answer within herself and turned her head to look again at Ellesandra, her answer was as honest, and earnest as she always was, though it was said quietly enough so as to not be distracting to Amelia and their sensitive, fluffy ears: "I want to be with you. That's all."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was taken a little aback by the request. On the one hand it sent butterflies swarming her stomach. She wanted to say yes, a little part of her wanted to take Star out on a nice fancy date. That part did not win, though. What won was Ellesandra making a noncommittal grunt and looking around. "That doesn't really give us a location to go, Star." She considered. Her heart was beating faster for absolutely no apparent reason right now. When she thought of what to do, she just kept thinking about the side by side, touching in some way. Eventually, she forced these thoughts out and brought up a task oriented focus. "Why don't we get some hot cocoa, find a nice cozy place to sit and discuss tactics together? And - and I know you want to talk about more than that." That's what the cocoa would be for, but she felt like that could remain unsaid. "And maybe look at stars, like we did that night on the tavern roof?"
Star Lumina	Star just gave a soft, amused smile. That was the point, you absolute goofball. It didn't matter where they went...So long as they were together. She didn't say these things of course. But it was enough for her to feel them in her heart. Then, hearing that they wanted to get cocoa and look at the stars? That had her blushing. She gently nodded. "M-Mmnh. I think that sounds nice." Of course, this did rely on them having some way back into the guild hall, didn't it? Somehow it got a lot less romantic if they had to have Amelia tag along. And a LOT less romantic for Star if Amara was tagging along. She looked at Ellesandra, a little uncertain on that matter, assuming they had...Thought that part through and had something in mind for it.
Ellesandra	Getting confirmation, Ellesandra looked up to Amelia, who was both leading them and studying. "Sorry to interrupt, Miss Wysperwick. Do you know if there are any patios or balconies or anything in the guild hall in which we can see the stars from? Helps us think and relax for the tactical conversation and making plans for the upcoming days." This was...true, but it wasn't the real reason Ellesandra has suggested doing so. Star seemed to enjoy it, and Ellesandra was a little tired of just being cooped up in their bedroom for such conversations. If it was a little public that would be okay, as long as they had some semblance of privacy. And for a place as fancy as the Guild Hall, she felt like there had to be some sort of option for that; or she hoped so anyways.
Star Lumina	Amelia blinked as she was addressed. She gave a slightly flat look at Ellesandra. "Please call me Amelia. Just Amelia. No miss. Unless you're just trying to make me feel old," she said with her usual attitude alive and well. Not snippy, still friendly, but that selfsame sarcasm was present. "But yeah, if you wanna go on a date there's an open air seating space in the rear of the guild hall that doesn't see a lot of people moving through it," she said, having an unusually swift delivery of the fact, as if it made her...Uncomfortable to talk about. Touching a nerve, maybe? She looked quick to jump back into the parchment in front of her, revising over the sigil sequence again and again and again and again and again until it was burned into her memory. Star looked...Not uncomfortable, but a bit nervous all the same from the response.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra was about to call Amelia miss again, just to tease her now that the attitude was back. She'd stopped in her tracks when Amelia referenced it as a date though. Her lips pursed and she looked displeased, but her heart was suddenly pounding harder and the damn butterflies were back again. She looked over at Star, who just seemed nervous at that, then back to Amelia. Should she correct Amelia? The part of her in denial wanted to, wanted to say loudly that it wasn't a date and they weren't dating. Then she remembered the feeling of Stars heart in her own chest, how upset and hurt Star had been at her rejection. So instead, she looked at Star. She lowered her voice, making it gentle. "This isn't a date." The words came out, but they very much conflicted with the nerves and anxiety in Ellesandras own body. Not to mention, there was now concern that she'd upset Star and cause another blow up, leading to them needing to delay longer. But even through that there was a spark of...excitement. Ellesandra hadn't been on a 'date' in a long time, even if this totally was not one at all whatsoever nu uh.
Star Lumina	Star blinked, then raised her hands defensively. Why was Ellesandra saying that to her? She didn't call it at date! A nervous expression came over her again, but ultimately she didn't seem offended or rejected. She saw it more just as Ellesandra getting in front of Amelia's brash declaration...One that had Star's own heart thumping in her chest. She understood it wasn't a date, so the pointed correction, while not painful, still was like a cold bucket of water over her excitement. "Uh huh, I sure do bring all my platonic super totally just friends and nothing else out for cocoa and romantic star-gazing, at least once a week in fact," said Amelia, and once Ellesandra looked back at her she made sure to flick the furry ears atop her head to make a point that she had keen hearing. Strange that Amelia had such a keen interest on Ellesandra and Star's relationship, but maybe it was just her attitude showing itself some more.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had said that to Star to set expectations. She didn't want Star getting her hopes up, then hurt. That was the goal of saying it anyways, but when Amelia poked at the faulty logic in what Ellesandra said there was...probably an unexpected reaction. There was a familiar, remembered pain. It was tied to and around the grief, but it itself wasn't the grief of losing Marigold. It was the acceptance Ellesandra finally had that her and Marigold would never be an item, no matter how much Ellesandra had wanted it. There was a beat of silence where Ellesandra wrestled irritation at Amelia down, along with the memory of that pain. And then she responded, maybe just a little more acidly than was necessary. "Thank you, Miss Amelia, for your obviously practiced and experienced opinion." The words were harsher than she'd actually meant them to be, and she knew it immediately. There was a pang of regret, but Ellesandra just turned her head and took a deep breath in. She didn't apologize, but did add - "Cocoa helps me think and process, and Star enjoys celestial watching." It was the explanation for why she'd suggested it. Even if it did have romantic undertones, her denial at least had this to hold onto. And she knew wading into this too much would only lead to her accidentally saying something that would upset Star, so she cleared her throat. "Should we pick up any supplies now, before we leave tomorrow Star? I guess it depends on where the portal opens up to?"
Star Lumina	Amelia, being that she had such an attitude, was fairly used to people snapping at her. It didn't faze her. She just smirked and rolled her eyes. She considered firing back, but there was a flicker of...Something. Anger? Pain? Something that she kept below the surface. Though it didn't stop Star from noticing. Star looked visibly uncomfortable now as she listened to Ellesandra's words to follow. Star gave a little shake of her head. "I can't think of anything specific," she said, meek and quiet. The tension between those two clearly was not doing well for her emotional state for some reason. Amelia interjected again, though it was to be actually helpful this time: "The portals are all sitting on the end of the arms that stretch out beyond city limits. Some people call them the clock hands, since there are twelve and they are equidistant. Just like the portal we walked in on. Any of those twelve exits will do. I'll be attuning the portal. Though if you're intent on leaving tomorrow, I'd suggest figuring out whether you are going alone, or if you are going to talk to the captain about seeing if there are plans to bring us along," she said, resisting the urge to add a snippy 'if you feel like you can tolerate me that is'.
Ellesandra	Ellesandras regret at snapping at Amelia was only intensified at how meek Star seemed to get. There was still pain in what Amelia had said, but that hadn't been her fault - she'd had no way of knowing that would trigger memories. She reached out to Star, hand taking hers just long enough to squeeze it reassuringly before she released it. "I meant more where the portal leads us to, such as if we get dumped into the middle of a wilderness or if we can get close to a town or city." She clarified this, unsure if she was misunderstanding something or if Amelia had misinterpreted her previous statement as where they enter the portal, not where they came out. In all honesty she assumed she herself was in the wrong; Amelia was certainly more intelligent than her and she had no issue admitting that. "And as long as Star is okay with it, considering this is her home plane, I think having you two join would be ideal." She looked at Star, thinking about what she'd mentioned about them having died to the armor if the other two weren't there. It was probably true.
Star Lumina	Star was happy to have the reassuring squeeze. She smiled. She took Ellesandra's hand with both her hands while they walked, just for a moment, to try and show her own support for Ellesandra in turn. She could see them hurting. She was there for them, she didn't want them to forget it. "That part should be controllable. If Star knows a place, that makes it easier. Portals tend to work best when you either have something from the plane, or knowledge of a specific place. Granted, local magic can be problematic. Appearing in the middle of some farming settlement is usually no big deal - at least, not accounting for how you'd freak out the locals - as there's unlikely to be any wards. Teleporting into a big city usually requires you know the destination of a circle to anchor yourself to. Any big magical city, like Waterdeep for example, will have things to prevent people from just...Appearing in the middle of their city without warning. Not perfect but...Generally speaking you want to aim for wilderness that is somewhat close to where you're going. There's variance and inaccuracies to consider, but Myst portals are generally accurate to within a kilometer, and have intelligent magical fortification in their magical structure that allows them to scry the destination for things like, oh, giant cliffs and canyons and lakes of lava and other things you might not want to step out into," explained Amelia, finally folding the parchment up again and closing her eyes, trying to repeat it from memory. "I'll make sure it's somewhere safe, and near whatever civilized place is the first stop." She didn't quite assume she was going to be included just yet, nearly having said 'our'. Star then gave a bit of an amused look at Ellesandra. "I might be from Gurhal, but it's not like I own it or have any say who comes or goes," she said with a giggle. "And of course I'm okay with it. I'd love to have you and Amara come with us, Amelia," said Star, earnest and sweet as ever. This had a similar effect to the last time she had addressed Amelia this way. A flush of red on the cheeks, a shy look away, as if the notion of being accepted so wholeheartedly was something the fox-eared woman struggled with.
Ellesandra	She accepted the small comfort of Star squeezing her hand too, for a moment. In the back of her mind there was an idea that she should try to process that, and that maybe Star could help. But it was pushed down for now; that was certainly not something she wanted to do with Amelia, or anyone else around anyways. Ellesandra nodded at all of this technical knowledge on how portals worked. Normally she would have been bored at this, but this information was actually useful and important for her job. She needed to know what to expect when going through, so as to best be able to protect Star after all. When Star mentioned not owning Gurhal, she shook her head. "No I meant -" What did she mean? She was just trying to be mindful of Star's privacy, with her home and this mission, if she wanted to keep it that way. Despite Star very consistently showing that she didn't care for or need the privacy that Ellesandra always did, she still erred on the side of giving it. "Nevermind. I agree, Miss Amelia." This time when she said it, there was none of the snark acid. It was teasing, to poke fun at her and give her back exactly what she tried to give to them consistently. A companionable teasing, more like. "Should we swing by somewhere to chat with the Captain before we settle in for the evening activities, first? I don't want to assume she's available for it and/or willing. You should know that there are some potentially powerful enemies who we will certainly have to go through to find Star's mother."
Star Lumina	"Really? Powerful enemies? Do let me know when they show up, because last time I just figured I'd summon Vaerix for the fun of it," said Amelia with no shortage of expected sarcasm that was firing back for their insistence on using 'miss'. She gave a playful look at Ellesandra. "I don't keep a bell on the captain, though, so if you wanna chat, we can swing by her room, see if she's there." The group arrived at the portal chamber, then, and Amelia opened the portal to the guild hall. It seemed that Ellesandra did want to speak to Amara, so unless there was an objection along the way, Amelia led the group along the halls that had row upon row of logically sorted groupings of rooms, which, as Amelia had promised to Ellesandra on a previous night, eventually featured the 'FC' series of rooms. FC1 was naturally the first, and had distinction upon it by way of an etched plaque nailed into the door that read 'Captain of the First Crusaders' with another below it bearing the name 'Amara Sunsong'. Hard to miss. Amelia rapped on the door a few times. Not long after, Amara came to the door in plain clothes. Amelia then gave a wide gesture towards the captain as she stepped aside, looking at Ellesandra to talk about whatever they wanted to talk about. Naturally, Amara was smiling, and welcomed the group into her room by standing aside. The room, while much larger than the guest rooms and sporting finer craftsmanship and materials, was surprisingly...Plain. No real personal effects could be seen, as one might expect of a permanent residence. Perhaps this wasn't where Amara preferred to live? Or perhaps there was some other reason it looked as sparse as a guest room.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra pictured Amara with a bell. A smirk came over her face and she looked at Amelia pointedly. "Why not? Not into that?" It had become apparent, at least she thought so, that Amara and Amelia weren't actually a couple like Ellesandra had first assumed. But if Amelia wanted to create a sassy, teasing relationship between them - Ellesandra could return. Now that she felt...kind of comfortable with the woman, anyways. Her guard was still up; she wasn't about to share personal information with Amelia, but a companionable teasing back and forth was perfectly comfortable for her. And based on the look she'd gotten previously when almost mentioning dominating women in her bed, Amelia at the very least wouldn't be too surprised by such teasing. Star, on the other hand, Ellesandra was a little uncertain of. After making the comment she glanced over at Star, a gauge to see if Star understood it, or it made her uncomfortable. There was caution there, wanting to ensure that she didn't make her companion uncomfortable with that type of joke. Either way though, she'd follow Amelia to Amara's room, eyeing the door with her name for a moment and taking a second to remember how to get here, if she needed to in the future. When Amara opened the door and waved them in, Ellesandra would allow Star in first before following up behind. She had to resist the urge to salute Amara, not only because her salute probably wasn't the same as Amara's company or that she was out of work gear, but because she felt like that would create an odd statement to start this off. She did a cursory glance around the room, mostly for danger, and didn't really find the lack of decoration concerning or odd at all. "Captain. We found what we're looking for, thanks to Miss Whippersnapper here." The intentional change of Amelia's last name was said without even looking in Amelia's direction, a completely stoic look on her face. "We were planning to set out tomorrow. I know there was interest in having people from here go to Gurhal to gather some information and details on the plain, and Amelia expressed interest in joining us on our journey to find Star's mother. Would you be interested in joining?" As with Professor Yami, Ellesandra got straight to the point. She really wasn't a negotiator, she was a straight shooter business type person. No need to beat around the bush.
Star Lumina	In order for Star to become uncomfortable with the joke, it would require she understand what the implication was. But the reality was shown by her response, which was a mumble mostly to herself: "Bells? Maybe...Fashionable?" she thought, once more exposing just how deep her innocence on the matter ran. Should the day ever come that Ellesandra met Star's previous guardian, Nina, the utter shock at how Star managed to retain her innocence around that woman might be enough to give Ellesandra whiplash. "Very creative, grandma, never heard that one before," said Amelia without a moment of hesitation. Amara wore a little smirk. "I see you two are getting along nicely," commented the captain, amused. "Seems you've been busy, then," she added as she closed the door behind the group, gesturing for Star and Ellesandra to have a seat on the couch in the living area. Not something Amelia needed, as the magi was already helping herself to lay herself out on the adjacent two-seater. Amara had a single chair, facing the couch, with a circular table in the middle. A fairly standard arrangement. "Whether I and Amelia go is less up to us and more up to the guild administration, but in this case that's more of a formality," said Amara with a smile. "Truth is, whether you want us to go to Gurhal or not, that is where we're going. There's knowledge to be gained, and possible artifacts to recover. It is in the interest of Myst that any magical artifacts we discover in our time there be secured and returned here for safe keeping and study," she said, which quietly implied that she and Amelia had first 'dibs' on anything notable. "I'd normally be bringing more of my team with me for this, however. At the very least, I'd prefer to have Rinnie, Maeva, and Kaspar. But you've caught us at a time where the rest of the crusaders are on other assignment. So, with that in mind, it'd fall to you both to fill in the needed combat roles to make for a successful expedition. Something that I think more than merits a fair share of spoils along the way," she said, donning another soft smile. Professional speak that asked Ellesandra to read between the lines. Bending the rules a little, it seemed. "If the terms are acceptable, then Amelia and I would be happy to join you two."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had to resist the urge to just reach out and ruffle Star's hair at her innocence and confusion. The grandma comment had her tilting her head and bringing a finger up to lightly bounce her silver haired ponytail. "Original." The dry sarcasm was sent right back at Amelia, but then her focus was entirely on Amara as she went through the specifics on them joining Star and Ellesandra. Ellesandra had begun frowning, looking over to Star, then back to them. "You're talking about going to a place that you have no purview over, gathering magical artifacts that belong to that location and realm, and bringing them back here. Without permission from said realm? And...if that is your mission, will it detract from our own?" Another glance at Star. "I don't know how much time we want to go off on side things before focusing on our own goal here." It was entirely possible Ellesandra had just...interpreted what Amara had said in the worst light. But when Amara said they went to other plains to 'gather information' that had been one thing. It was important to learn of various cultures and stuff right? Or some wise scholar probably said so at some point in time. But specifically seeking out magical artifacts within said plane and bringing them back to Myst felt like they were closer to thieves than they were explorers or scholars. It was one thing if the artifact was particularly dangerous or evil, and it needed to be guarded or protected, but for the average thing it didn't sit right with Ellesandra. Then again, she didn't know the whole story, and she hired herself out to guard for missions like this within her own realm before. Oh, she'd ensured it was an artifact that no one currently owned; she wouldn't hire herself out as a thief's hitwoman, but if they happened to stumble upon something in a cave she looked the other way. There was just a bit of surprise, having expected something different from the Captain, was all.
Star Lumina	Amara chuckled. "It's not as though the realm itself has any way for me to talk to it and make sure it's fine with us taking the item in question. Now, if the artifact already has a clear owner, or it comes to our understanding that someone has ownership of it, well. That's a different story, and bids for fair trade come into play. But many artifacts end up lost, without owner for whatever reason. And it is the mission of the First Crusaders to secure these things such that they do not fall into the wrong hands. While it might be romantic to envision the Book of Exalted Deeds falls neatly into the lap of someone who will go on to do, well...Exalted deeds, it just as easily could wind up in the hands of someone who seeks to throw it into the river Styx, banishing its goodness for generations to come. Matters little for common magic, but some say Myst was created as a vision for what could be, if magic was properly structured with law and guiding philosophy of doing the greatest good, while allowing the least harm. Hardly perfect, but...That's the goal. As for whether our mission will detract from yours, well. Anything important enough to warrant a full investigation and retrieval would also be something I wouldn't attempt to do with just myself and Amelia. So as for how things stand now, the intent is just to scout the realm, while eliciting the helpful guidance of a local," she said, smiling at Star. Star had a fairly neutral expression, but did smile at Amara. There was a lot to consider. "Speaking practically about it, I would say the most likely distraction from the goal would be a couple of hours, maybe an overnight stay in a location to secure something of value before moving on. I understand that that isn't nothing, so if it results in us parting ways, there wouldn't be any hard feelings. Could always let you two go on ahead while we catch up, or something. There's too many variables to say how things would shake out, and it's not worth speculating. But at least initially, I imagine having the four of us together will set us off on the best foot, as opposed to
Star Lumina	Amara chuckled. "It's not as though the realm itself has any way for me to talk to it and make sure it's fine with us taking the item in question.

But at least initially, I imagine having the four of us together will set us off on the best foot, as opposed to each of us going our own way. I'd rather not just speak as though I'm calling the shots here, though. You tell me what's important to you, and what you need from us, to see if we can come to something mutual."
Ellesandra	That idea still didn't feel entirely right to Ellesandra, but Amara did have a point. Sometimes having a powerful magical artifact just laying around somewhere might be more of a detriment to people around it than having someone come in, find it and bring it back. She listened to the rest of how things would be outlined, before looking over to Star. Really, this was her decision, not Ellesandra's. "I see no harm in that. And we can make a decision at the time if we need to split off for a bit, but I know you were seeking ways to make money anyways and it's entirely possible both of those could align. If some magical artifact happened to be causing undead to spill out of graveyards or something." She was intentionally choosing a positive reason to take an artifact - one that she knew Star would agree to help with and honestly, she would too. Star would see that there was trepidation within Ellesandra, but it wasn't that it was paranoia. It was caution, and though she relatively trusted Amara to have their back if something happened - she'd proven that based on their fight with the magical armor - she hardly knew the captain. Caution felt necessary, but there was no reason not to agree to go along together at least for a ways.
Star Lumina	Amara gave a soft smile. "Certainly something we'd want to get involved in," said Amara in agreement. Truly they were not vagrant thieves taking anything magical that wasn't nailed down, but it was still easy to see how their work could be viewed as disruptive to what might be 'natural' or 'fated' for those that ascribed to such notions. Star looked back at Ellesandra. She couldn't really say it aloud, but she did wish that the decision was more mutual than left on her shoulders. She erred on the side of trust, Ellesandra on the side of caution. She felt that the best decision was often somewhere in between, and preferred to not drag Ellesandra along. Such things to add to the pile of things to talk about. For now, Ellesandra seemed to outline it well. Star nodded. "We'll all be safer traveling together. There are dangerous places in Gurhal. Plenty of safe places, of course, but...There's a lot of things in Gurhal that, from my travels elsewhere, I can come to realize were not at all typical. Like these things we call nar lillies - sentient flowers that will expel poison on you from their beaks." A flower with a beak in itself sounded...strange. The example evoked some raised brows. "Things you wouldn't expect. I'm sure things even I don't know about, so...We'll be safest together," said Star, nodding once more. She seemed set, concluded that this was the best path forward. And if they had to separate, they could figure that out in the moment.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had been trying to share the decision by giving her input. Sure she put the final decision on Star, but in her mind her opinion had been given and Star could decide anything in between. A compromise of going together, but with the option to split off if needed later was perfect. She nodded, then turned back to look at Amara with a smile. "So, Captain, I think what she is saying is we shouldn't stop to smell the roses. A flower shooting poison at you sounds like a very unsavory experience. An interesting gift from a spurned ex though." Ellesandra was attempting to let humor lighten the tension she personally felt with what Amara had said regarding their goals. She was going to give Amara and Amelia - and the rest of Myst - the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. Didn't mean she wouldn't be cautious, even more so with magical items like her card, but the two had done nothing but show them kindness so far. "Is there anything on our end that needs to be done to get the red tape with the guild completed? Or additionally needed to be done prior to setting out tomorrow?" Best to know now and plan how to address than to wait until tomorrow just before setting out to panic do something last minute.
Star Lumina	Star seemed to enjoy the result. She then giggled. "Well. They are also like five feet tall, so not really a romantic flower you can slip into a bouquet. They can also just, you know, bite you. There's also a rare cousin of them that..." she gently shook her head. "I think we'll just try to avoid them if we see them. I might be immune to poison, but I assume I'm alone there." With the topic moving to red tape, she set about sitting politely and quietly again. Amara shook her head. "You two don't need to do anything. I'll handle everything on my end in the morning for me and Amelia. Just a matter of informing of our intent. In an absolute emergency, we may be recalled to Myst but...We'll cross that bridge if it comes to it."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra considered making a joking comment about being prepared for them to abandon Star and her, but decided that her relationship with Amara wasn't yet at a point where that type of joking comment could be made easily. Instead, she nodded. The information about Star being immune to poison was new, and she tucked that away as something to ask about during their tactics conversation. Well, maybe it wasn't new - the book had said she couldn't get sick or diseased or anything in a normal way, and poison was kind of along that vein, but Ellesandra hadn't connected the dots fully. With that confirmation, she'd glance over to Amelia - who had been pretty silent since the first bit, and then back to Amara. "Well, if nothing else is needed then, Star and I were going to talk more tactics in case we were to get into another fight again. I can't always rely on you to distract an enemy when I take a blow like I did last time." She would take a step back towards the door, but looked back towards Amara and Amelia, just to confirm there was nothing else they needed to add. "We'll meet you for breakfast tomorrow around dawn? Or is that too early?"
Star Lumina	There was something in the way Amara was looking at Ellesandra that suggested they had more to say, but was keeping it to themselves. Star seemed briefly uncomfortable and avoided looking at Amara. Amelia was flicking between looking at the parchment she had and folding it to close her eyes. "Sounds like a plan, Ellesandra," said Amara. "Dawn it is. I'll ensure everything is wrapped up this evening, then." Professional and polite. "That means you should head to bed early as well, Amelia," said Amara, evoking a groan from Amelia. "Yeah, yeah, kicking me out, I see how it is," said Amelia in turn, rolling off her place to stand. She moved out of the room and set off to her room unless there was more business for her. Amara moved to the door to see them off. If there were no closing remarks, she wished the pair good night. Star smiled at Amara, though was left with a lingering, difficult expression as the were to set off. Amelia called out before disappearing into her room: "Just follow the hall we were walking along to the end and hang a right to get to your date, you two." And the door closed before Ellesandra could quip back, of course.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra saw the look in Amara's eyes. She frowned, scrunching her eyebrows together. Unlike Star, she wasn't able to tell there was interest there. In reality, she'd been bad at telling someone was interested in her forever; she was cautious about people and always just assumed interest in her was friendly, at best. So she wasn't sure what was going on there, and as they headed out of Amara's room, she had stayed in there rather than walking off. She'd rolled her eyes at Amelia's comment, feeling...anger at her for pointing out what it kind of was, even against Ellesandra's denial. Denial didn't work well when someone was throwing it back in your face that it was what you were denying it was. There were the same conflicted emotions as before at the prospect of this being a date, but Amelia hadn't given her time to respond anyways. She just clenched her jaw and shook her head, before looking over to Amara. "You had something else to say. Is all okay?" Ellesandra's ignorant ass thought Amara had something else of concern in regards to the mission or their joining together, not interest in Ellesandra herself. She was also unfortunately not picking up the odd behavior from and expression on Star's face regarding the woman. Eventually she'd learn to watch Star closer in regards to how she was responding to other's emotions, but for right now she was still feeling uncomfortable at the idea of Star being able to see that in others - and her potentially gaining any insight into them from Star's ability to do that.
Star Lumina	There was a lot that went unsaid, a lot that went unknown under the otherwise scrutinizing eyes of the knight. A flick of Amara's eyes at Star, the flick of her ear upon hearing Amelia call it all a date, then her eyes refocused on Ellesandra. She donned a warm smile, as the interest that was there was snuffed out by the notion that it was...Not worth the complication. Truly, it had only been physical attraction. Amara didn't know Ellesandra well enough for there to be anything beyond that. And knowing there might be something between Ellesandra and Star like that, well. She was a polite woman who knew when to back off. She gently shook her head. "Don't worry about it, Ellesandra. It doesn't matter any longer, and all is well. Forget I ever asked," she said, donning a warm smile before excusing herself back into her room to close the door on the others, unless Ellesandra had more to say of course.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra paused, blinking. And then after Amara closed the door, she turned to look at Star with an expression of befuddlement. "She...didn't ask anything though?" Ellesandra racked her brain to remember if Amara had asked a question during that conversation that had gone unanswered. She didn't think so, and she shook her head, beginning to walk down the hallway in the direction Amelia had indicated while looking back towards Star. "I didn't unintentionally offend her or something, did I?" She knew that she could come off as brash or cold sometimes, with being so straight to the point, and the fact that she'd called out that it sounded like thievery only now occurred to Ellesandra as an insult or offensive.
Star Lumina	Star gave a soft smile at Ellesandra as she walked alongside them. She obviously knew the answer. All the answers. But.. "I don't know how to answer that.." she said softly, clearly fighting with herself on the matter. On the one hand she wanted to assure Ellesandra it was nothing of the sort, but ever since seeing how uncomfortable it had made Ellesandra in the past to step over the line, she had overcorrected to not sharing anything, even if it was something one might be able to be reasonably certain of with just examining someone else's expressions. There was no way for Star to say 'I don't THINK she was offended'. There was only what she knew. It wasn't speculation, for her. "Also uhm...Didn't you want to get some cocoa before we went over there?"
Ellesandra	That comment brought Ellesandra up short. She looked at Star, realizing that she clearly knew what had caused Amara's response. Yet she was respecting Ellesandra's wish that she not share things that she learned based on seeing their aura. A moment passed with Ellesandra watching her, unsure how to feel about that, but then...She smiled. Her heart skipped a beat and there was part of her that felt touched, and grateful that Star was withholding that. Star had truly taken her concerns to heart previously, in how she'd done that with Amelia, and changed the behavior here. After a moment of watching her, she nodded at the reminder for cocoa. "You're right, sorry." There weren't more words given in regards to the Amara situation, but she did reach out and take Star's elbow to squeeze for a moment. A silent thanks. In a way, it helped anyways. She knew Star had seen whatever was going on for Amara, and it obviously hadn't frightened or upset her. So, it couldn't be anything too bad. The squeeze to her elbow was brief before she began back down the hallway towards the main guild hall, where they could order a couple mugs of cocoa. "Would you like any food to go with that, Star?" She'd ask before they got there. It had been a long day and they hadn't eaten since breakfast after all, would be a nice dinner. Definitely not a date. Definitely not a date.
Star Lumina	Star had never met anyone like Ellesandra before. Someone so intensely private. She herself was so open that, while there was a great deal of guidance from her mother on how to be respectful with her gift, sometimes those good intentions didn't work out so well. But her awareness of and comfort with emotion did, at least, allow her to overcome emotional barriers, rigid pride, or other things that made people slow to change, with relative ease. She was human, just like Ellesandra. Fallible. But over the time she had known Ellesandra, she had learned things piece by piece, and among them knew how much more action meant than words to the knight. So when Ellesandra smiled, she smiled back. She wasn't proving a point; she would have done just the same regardless, but she was glad that Ellesandra saw the change. She was glad her respect for her companion was showing. Back to the main guild hall, she considered the offer of food. "I don't know that I want anything right now...Cocoa and conversation doesn't feel quite the same if I have a salad leaf poking out of my chubby cheeks," she said with a giggle, focused more on connecting with her companion than her body's needs. "But if you're hungry, well, we could add dinner to the mix. I don't mind either way."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra made it to the guild hall, though was looking at Star with incredulity. "Chubby cheeks?" She almost, almost, asked her why she had a salad leaf in her ass crack. That tossing a salad didn't mean that literally. But she refrained, not only because she fully expected Star to not get that joke, but also because their dynamic wasn't like that. Star was too...innocent to joke around with like that, and Ellesandra didn't want to do anything to make her uncomfortable. She had to pull back the joking attitude she'd brought up around Amelia to back to the typical interactions with Star. Instead, she shook her head and looked thoughtful. "What if we do dinner and discuss strategy and then cocoa for..." She paused. Was she really about to say this? The normal, withdrawn, independent person in her told her she was a fool for thinking it. But the remembered pain from Amelia's words, and how she'd snapped at Amelia for saying something she didn't really know was painful. She cleared her throat. "I think I have a thing or two to process, and cocoa helps with that." She reiterated from the last time she had cocoa. She was actively not looking towards Star, not wanting to see her look annoyed or irritated that Ellesandra wanted her help in processing...something.
Star Lumina	The repeated words phrased as a question had Star puff out her cheeks as if they were full of food to mime it out. She then let out the air with a puff and giggled. Then...Pride. That was what held most people back from accepting help. Whether it was pride, or guilt, shame, or something else, she'd certainly see it in Ellesandra. Looking away was...Somewhat pointless. Annoyance and irritation, but was it with themselves? What was the root? Her eyes sought the answer, though ultimately all she cared about was that she was there to support Ellesandra, and did so with a hand on their back. Their armor did dampen the gesture a little, but she'd gotten used to that. "Sounds like a great plan, Ellesandra. Whatever helps, I'm all for it."
Ellesandra	It wasn't entirely pride that held her back from accepting help. Part of it was that she didn't think she deserved help, that she deserved to struggle with this type of thing. Another part was that she didn't want to bother anyone else with her problems. That was the bigger one, having been raised to be so self sufficient when it came to her emotions. Well, that hadn't turned out super well, but still. She would nod, not acknowledging Star's gesture because that would force her to admit she appreciated it or needed it.Instead, she headed up to the bartender to request a couple of basic meals. She made sure to include one of the salads for Star, while getting herself whatever was being offered as the dinner meal for the evening, even if it was just a stew type meal, and then pulling out the coins to pay for it. A glance was given to Star and she looked around the main hall. "Do you want to eat here and then go back? Or would you like to go back and eat food and then come back up for cocoa?" The being outside with Stars had been an idea specifically for Star, since she'd mentioned enjoying looking at them. And maybe the stars in Myst were different - they hadn't really gotten an opportunity to see those.
Star Lumina	"Hum...Maybe just eat quick here and then head off with the cocoa? Whichever you think is best, don't want to unnecessarily be walking back and forth unless you want to, well...Enjoy the time alone together," she said, not really sure how else to phrase it, though immediately did feel as though she phrased it a bit more romantically than intended. Not that she was going to take that back, no. She was fine with it coming out that way. Happy accident, or maybe just her heart speaking for her instead of her brain. Regardless, she would follow Ellesandra's lead. The meals on offer were standard fare, meat, veg, potato, with some gravy. Salad was also certainly an option, with a good mix of greens and veggies. Today's salad had chopped apple in it as well, but if the plan was to eat more as a satisfaction of need, then it would be eaten accordingly with minimal chatter so they could get to the part Star was most looking forward to.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra shrugged, deciding to just get both the cocoa and meals together, and take them back to the location Amelia pointed out. Star was right, walking back and forth for it didn't really make sense. For her part, the comment about spending or enjoying time alone together didn't make sense considering they were going to be alone together either way. Well, 'alone' as in being in a relatively private but still public place. She'd find them a seat that was as private and distant from others as she could though, and would do as she said she would - she'd launch into strategy talk over the actual dinner. The personal stuff could wait until after, until she could have the cocoa held in both hands and close to her, smelling it. "So, i think you've got a good idea of my magical and fighting capabilities already. Though if you weren't aware yet, if you cast a spell on me that would normally boost someone's capabilities in battle, it won't have as much of an effect. It will, however, provide me with additional mana and energy to use my own spells without having as much of a physical cost as they do, like how I was so tired after the fight with the Pirate Captain." She could convert the magical mana into the physical energy that powered her Haste Spell, for example. "So it does have that effect. Or if you are out of range of someone but I'm in range, and closer to them, you can cast the spell on me and I redirect to them. It won't be as effective, a greatly reduced effect, but still - if you're trying to heal someone on the brink of death but they're too far away, any bit might help hold them over until you get closer."
Star Lumina	The two moving to the outside space while carrying along their food was a simple affair. When they arrived, it would reveal quite a view indeed. A starry, cloudless sky with an almost too perfect crescent-moon hanging high and bright in the sky. The stars and moon illuminated the ground significantly more than a true night sky would. Even in night, it was easy to see. Not as bright as day of course, but it seemed even the light levels of day and night were tuned by the realm to be utilitarian. It didn't diminish from their outward beauty of course, but some amount of sentimental value might be taken away for some. It was pretty and bright, to some that was all that mattered. Certainly not bright enough to keep people awake, but nowhere near the pitch blackness that some nights could bring. Just subtle enough to probably not notice, while being clear enough to do so if one focused on it. There proved to be entirely...Nobody else in the area Amelia described, set up with benches, though no tables. So it would be a little awkward to eat, more so than if there were tables, but the cocoa sat just as securely on the bench as it did a tabletop all the same. Just meant they had to hold their plates as well. This place was situated at the edge of the athenaeum such that if the two looked over the edge, they would be able to see the cloudy abyss quite a ways down. They were up pretty high, though there was no associated high wind with the height. Star gently nodded to the tactical discussion. "Good to know. I think I can use that to our advantage, though...There's still some...Experiments I'd like to try with you sometime. I didn't mention it but...When you first told me about our resonance and I realized that is what we share, there was a lot that came to mind that would be useful with that. Just, well...You didn't seem too keen on the idea at the time so I didn't push it. But just like how my sympathetic healing sort of...Bypasses your resistance, there's other auramancy I can do with that. It just, well...Requires we actually embrace that resonance, which we haven't." Potential existing, yet untapped. "In lieu of that, well...There's some abjuring spells I know that might be helpful. And if it just gives you mana otherwise, that is...Something," she said, tapping at her lips thoughtfully with the handle of her fork. "Redirection seems like a niche use, but good to know all the same."
Ellesandra	Well, she'd expected tables out here. All was well though. She'd set the cocoa on the bench and balanced her food in her lap, eating from that while looking sidelong at Star rather than directly at her. When she commented on redirection being niche, a small smirk spread over her lips. "Niche for an ally to use. Great if a mage decides to cast fireball at me. I can prevent the explosion from hitting those around me by absorbing it and then redirecting it back at the enemy." Oh sure, it still burnt her like a bitch, even if less so than it normally would, but she'd survive it assuming she wasn't already on death's door when it happened. Though something else she said caught her attention. "Will you...elaborate on what you mean by embracing the resonance?" Ellesandra wasn't about to let Star fully feel everything she felt. If that's what she meant, they probably wouldn't embrace the resonance for a long time, if ever. But if there was something more minor she could do to bring the resonance closer and give Star more agency within a fight - well, she'd consider it at least. "And as for abjuration spells, any of them should work if they don't actually focus on me. Like if there is a magical wind that deflects arrows; that wouldn't be reduced necessarily by me. But say - I've seen some people cast shield of faith, or mage armor. Neither of those would have a whole lot of effect, since it's cast directly on my person. That's why I don't interact with portals poorly, but if someone grabbed me and tried to teleport me directly...I honestly don't know how that would work or what the spell would do." No one had ever tried, and she wasn't about to let them unless it was entirely dire circumstances.
Star Lumina	"Armor of Agathys is more of my go-to, shield of faith and mage armor are good too though," she added idly. "And of course, I saw how you resisted the thunderwave that struck you against the pirate captain. I have the ability to sculpt my spells such that they can avoid hurting my allies, so you having a defensive option for when enemies do things is very useful," she said, perhaps bringing recollection to the initial encounter Ellesandra had with Star. How she blinded the enemies, but Ellesandra hadn't been affected. "As for embracing resonance, well...It's, like a lot of things, hard to explain. I've obviously never done it before but...It's a method of cultivating the connection we already have. Empowering it. I...Admit I don't know everything that might happen from doing it, so even if we do want to try it, I'd...Want to take it slow. It has degrees, you know? Right now just think of it as being at a base level, which is already strong enough to let my sympathetic healing work without impedance. But, remember that shimmering armor I can have? It's what my mother called chromatic aurmancy. It's very powerful stuff, and can do more than just shield me, though that's the only chromatic aurmancy I've mastered so far. And it's pretty taxing on me, but...Hard to argue with its effectiveness. Uh. The reason I mention it is that if we did embrace that resonance, empower it, then I could...Perform that sort of thing on you instead. On your aura, to be specific. And so you can see how making you invulnerable to physical attacks, on top of you naturally being resilient to magic, could be pretty useful in a pinch. It would take some practice on my end, of course. But even if we just did a tiny bit of it, I could perform some more of my usual auramancy on you. Stuff like empowering your stamina, your strength, reaction time, speed...Putting those supportive magics on you on top of your own haste could make you quite the formidable fighter," she said, smiling. "There's just...One thing that I know you might not like about it. Uh...See, at some level of resonance, from what I remember my mother talking about, you'll...Be able to see me, the same way I see you. Just me, of course. Just...My aura. And while that doesn't mean you're going to understand exactly what you see, at least not for a while, I know it might not be something you...Want."
Ellesandra	She considered all of the benefits that Star was explaining. That all did sound potentially powerful, especially if Star could take the idea of empowering her physical defenses and actually do it without entirely exhausting herself. Then again, she remembered how tired Star had been after using it against the pirates and she shook her head. "We should try anything that would exhaust you like that, at least not unless necessary. We don't want to have to take too much time recovering just to test something that might not work on me." There was another pause as she processed what she'd be able to see. There was...definitely discomfort there. But there was also some acceptance. At least, Ellesandra didn't dismiss it off hand. She turned to look away from Star, taking another bite and slowly chewing while considering her options. "That's the only thing that will change? Is that I'll be able to see more of your aura? I - Star, I don't like that, but you're already pretty open about your emotions. If it were anyone else, or being able to see other people's aura's too, it would be an immediate no. But at this point...is there anything you'd even try to hide from me, about yourself that is?" She knew Star would hold back information about other people now, but she wouldn't be able to see that. She'd be able to see Star's emotions, and she wasn't aware of Star holding anything back there. Maybe the jealousy that she'd felt before - if she saw what it was directed at? "It's not like I haven't dug around in your aura already. When you were unconscious."
Star Lumina	"The only thing I know of. Even that would take time of repeated strengthening. It wouldn't be immediate. Think of it as you becoming more...Sensitive to my aura, and by extension, my magic. When we're actually...Doing the act of it, it'll be at its strongest, and you'll see me wholly and fully during that time. I can make any aura fully receptive to my magic with enough, you know...Forcing it. But what makes this resonance special is how natural it can eventually become. It will allow you to do the same to me of course, though I don't know if any of your magic really qualifies as magic you could cast on me." She gently shrugged. Then, she set her plate down. "As for...If there's anything I'd hide from you, well..." She extended held her hand out, palm up, for Ellesandra to take. "Take my hand. I'll bare myself to you right now. Don't hold back. Accept the feeling and just...Let yourself feel what's in my heart." If they were going to go down this path, Ellesandra would be able to see it anyway in time. She had nothing to hide, even though there were things that had not yet been explicitly spoken.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra frowned at the idea of just becoming more sensitive to Star's aura. That would mean that she'd be able to see Star's aura, even when it wasn't actively being used together? That would mean that there would essentially be no way for Star to be able to keep secrets from her. Well, emotional secrets anyways. It wasn't like Star could read Ellesandra's mind, so it certainly wouldn't work that way the other direction right? But being able to hide emotions. She thought of that jealousy and shifted, a bit uncomfortable at the idea again. "I'm not sure." She said, looking at Star's hand held out, then down to her food. She took another bite then set it to the side, letting her time to chew cover as a buffer for her to consider. Even if Star was comfortable sharing everything right this moment, didn't mean that she'd be comfortable with Ellesandra seeing it in the future. If going forward with this would take that choice away from her, would Ellesandra want to do it? She reached for her cocoa, pulling it up to sniff and sip, eyes closed. Finally, after a moment of silence while holding the cocoa close, she set it to the side and took Star's hand. She didn't look at Star, teeth clenched, but she was accepting this so far. It didn't even take an auramancer to see that she was fighting the discomfort with the idea though - she looked actively unsure about it.
Star Lumina	Star gently nodded. "We're not committing to anything. I'm just going to show you what it'll be like for you. So...Please...Look at me, Ellesandra. I want to share at least this with you, no matter what path we walk." she said, then gently took the woman's hand. She guided it to her chest, letting the knight's gauntleted hand rest over her heart. The gentle thumps could be felt just below the surface, dulled by the armor. She pressed both her hands to the back of Ellesandra's own, pushing their armored palm flush against her skin. She kept her eyes on Ellesandra. And with a slow, gentle wash of what felt like a soothing mist caressing all along Ellesandra's skin, Star's aura came to light before Ellesandra's eyes. It was a brilliant, shimmering mixture of colours, predominantly a soft azure. It was almost...Fluid in its appearance, as it had been each other time it had been seen. It flowed over Star in slow, carefree waves. And though the colours meant nothing to someone unaccustomed to it as Ellesandra, the physical connection brought with it Star's guiding hand - both metaphorically and literally, with how she guided it to her heart. Through this, her emotions made sense. There was happiness. Contentment. Serenity. These together seemed to form the blue that took up most of Star's aura. An inner peace that many with turbulent hearts might envy. The result of letting herself be at one with her emotions. It was a...Healthy feeling. The feeling that had been missing when Star had fallen ill. It was reassuring. For someone protective over her like Ellesandra, it would be a strong reassurance that Star was okay. The sort of thing that would allow the knight to rest easy, knowing in the depths of their mind that Star was not in danger, and was happy. There were fleeting traces of other emotion, of course. Subconscious emotions that were being felt and worked through. A bit of that jealousy remained. Some small pieces of aimless uncertainty. Self-doubts. Anxieties. A small void that desired reassurances. Things that didn't need to be addressed, weren't actively affecting Star. But an insight that even Star might not realize consciously that she would be happier if given reassurances. Not that that was a grand revelation - people being reassured was generally a good way to make them feel better even if they were doing all right. But the other contending emotion that was not at all subtle? The other emotion that had yet been unspoken? It was, in this moment, Star's confession to Ellesandra in the identical way as Ellesandra had, albeit unintentionally, confessed to her. The affection. The romantic attraction. The desire for emotional intimacy with Ellesandra - and, to a subdued extent, physical intimacy as well; she could not deny her own desires to surrender her virginity to Ellesandra, even if this moment was about anything but that. But being completely, entirely open to another person meant sharing that, too. There was no...Expectation attached to these emotions. No anticipation. No...Belief that exposure to it would compel action. It could be seen on Star's face, too. She seemed just...Happy. Happy to share herself with Ellesandra in this way, even if it was revealing things that the average person would find very difficult to admit. It needed time and careful nurturing before it might eventually blossom into love but...All the same feelings Ellesandra kept caged deep in their heart, Star felt with freedom and open acceptance for it all to flow through her heart as it needed to, for better or worse.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra did look over to Star, obvious hesitation in her demeanor, but doing as asked. Her hand was taken and placed over Star's heart and she felt that expectation, acceptance flow through her as the area around Star lit up. She'd seen Star's aura before, but she had very intentionally tried not to see it. As in she saw the aura, the colors, but never tried to figure them out. Never put her mind to looking at them and ascertaining what they meant. The feeling as Star guided her sight and mind to identifying them was...odd. The blue was a reassuring, just as Star would have expected. The fact that it took up so much of Star's aura was even better. If this became a thing she could do more often, it may be that she could look specifically for that blue then stop paying attention to the rest. Yet, Star didn't let that happen in this instance. No, she identified the jealousy. The uncertainty and some anxieties. The reassurances needed. They made her eyebrows scrunch up in confusion, wondering if her touches to reassure hadn't actually been doing what she'd intended them to. Or were these verbal reassurances needed? Being told she was pretty and the like? Ellesandra wasn't sure exactly, but she got entirely, totally distracted by just...feeling Star's attraction and romantic feelings towards her. Feeling this did two big things to Ellesandra. First, and probably the most noticeably felt, was a surge of panic. She almost ripped her hand away from Star at the feelings, only not doing so because the tactical part of her mind told her this type of connection might be necessary in the days to come. Still, feeling Star's attraction and interest in her...scared Ellesandra. These weren't just physical attraction, wanting a roll in the hay type feelings. These were more than that. And Ellesandra was suddenly terrified that she was going to break Star's heart, that she wouldn't be able to give Star what she wanted. That she was too broken to be a partner to Star. At the same time, the cage around her own romantic feelings for Star all but actually disappeared. The bars got wider, so that in all intent and purpose, it wasn't actually a cage anymore. Her denial would say it was a cage, say it was locked up, say it didn't exist. But it wasn't even being truly held back, anymore. The feelings flickered and grew, knowing they were returned in kind. Knowing that the potential wasn't just potential, but if Ellesandra went for it, would be a thing - at least for a time. Like responded to like. Ellesandra's active mind was too focused on the panic and not yanking away that she didn't notice, but her heart rate had picked up - and her cheeks had reddened into an actual blush. It stood out easily on her pale skin and white complexion. She didn't speak, unsure what to say or do, and just trying not to hurt Star by yanking her hand away even though every ounce of her conscious mind was telling her to do that.
Star Lumina	Star kept her smile. She would have felt a little bad if Ellesandra ripped their hand away. But that they didn't, despite clearly being overwhelmed and wanting to, meant a lot to Star. Ellesandra would see it. The way her aura gently brightened, blossoming with a surge of happy feelings. The blush on Ellesandra's cheeks was met with a smile and blush in return. Of course it made Star nervous. Her fingers trembled lightly on the back of Ellesandra's. She had, functionally, just confessed her affections to the knight. There was no way this happened without her blushing brightly. She saw the fear. She saw the apprehension. She let this linger for a moment, then gently pulled their hand away to let it settle back down on their lap. The connection faded. Her aura slowly faded from vision. Still, she smiled, still blushing. "...It's..." How to say this? Ah... "I know it's overwhelming. Just...Take a moment. Breathe. And understand nothing...HAS...To change. Just because we feel something doesn't mean it has to translate to action. But when I was pleading with you to let that part of you live, well...I obviously want it to live in me, too. So...As much as I had been trying to find the right time to make how I felt clear by...Telling you...I kinda feel like this is more fitting. And if it comes to pass that we do empower the resonance between us, well...Regardless of what happens between us, it's only right that you know what you'll be seeing. Every time I look at you...It's going to be there. Those feelings in my heart. I...Hope that helps you see that I have nothing...Nothing at all in my heart that I need to hide from you. You can see me like that any time you want, just as I see you."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra took in a deep breath when Star pulled her hand away. That was the permission she needed to pull it back to her own lap and turn away from Star. She clasped her hands together in her lap, then reached for the mug of cocoa to wrap around it, the metal of her gauntlets clicking against the mug. She'd turned away so much that her back was partially to Star. Her breathing was extremely forced, an intentional control of it despite the turmoil of panic and self-doubt within her. On the one hand, knowing that Star was also interested in her should make her feelings easier to act on, right? That hand was so small compared to the other though. The fact that Ellesandra had never been in an actual relationship, and that was what Star wanted. The fact that she was so traumatized and broken, and that she couldn't really process her emotions like Star could. That Star was so open and she was so private to the point that Stars powers alone felt like an invasion - and it wasn't something Star could control. The fear that Star would be able to see if she even had a brief moment of annoyance or irritation at her, something that happened more often with lovers in the past than Ellesandra had ever admitted but she didn't share that out loud. She couldn't be stoic and choose her battles around Star; everything would be a battle. And the biggest thing of all was the feeling that Star deserved way better than someone whose emotional turmoil was already as fucked up as Ellesandra's was. Overwhelming wasn't the right word for it. There was so much darkness, self deprecation and doubt happening within her right now that it almost snuffed out the flames of feelings for Star all together. It didn't, more just covered them so that they weren't being actively felt at that moment, but still. "Star." She whispered, unable to give more force to her voice than just that soft whisper. "That...shouldn't happen. You need to know not to expect...that." It was technically an improvement. Last time, she'd said it couldn't happen. This time, she was saying it shouldn't happen. Not that it would be any less of a potential blow on Star, but still. Her body language was telling Star everything even without the ability to see these feelings in her aura. Her elbows were tucked down close to her stomach, she was leaning over slightly and...well, they were still in a semi-public place, which was the only thing preventing her from fully leaning down onto her knees like she were in a fetal position. But Ellesandra was terrified of hurting Star, of being too broken and too...callous, non emotional, and not worth Star's affection.
Star Lumina	Star's hand gently landed on Ellesandra's back. There was no hurt. There was a world of difference in her mind between a snappy lash-out rejecting everything and what she saw and heard now. Fear. Self-doubt. Darkness. Things that she knew without a doubt were plaguing Ellesandra. She spoke softly, without a hint of sorrow: "I don't expect anything, Ellesandra. I've been saying all along that it's not what comes of these feelings that I care about. Of course there are outcomes I would...Enjoy...But it's difficult to convey how there are things I...Want...But that I have no expectation of it. It's not like I of all people don't understand that emotions are...Complicated." She paused, moving her hand to Ellesandra's armored shoulder in a sign of support. "That the feelings exist at all is a beautiful thing. And they make me happy. That's why I said nothing has to change. It just means a lot to me to be...Open with you. And for you to be as open as you're able to be, with me."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra felt a lot more comfort from the reassurance that they didn't have to do anything. That there was no expectation of it. That there were feelings, but they could just exist without Ellesandra's refusal to acknowledge them hurting Star. At least, right now it didn't seem to be hurting Star - in the future, who knew. It took a few moments of deep breaths, bringing the cocoa up to her face and just letting the soft steam and smell move up into her nose. The effect was calming, soothing, and that was only added by knowing that Star's hand was on her shoulder. A few moments, and then she straightened, clearing her throat. She'd worked through the panic, but it was still there. It was all bundled around that cage of emotions, unable to touch one without the other creeping up now. Those self doubts, and then of course the fear of having feelings for Star and something happening to her only making the other fears worse. Convincing herself that those feelings weren't worth exploring. She turned back to Star, feeling...sheepish and silly, like she'd just done something that was foolish or childish. "Sorry. I -..." She didn't finish that sentence, not wanting to talk about her inexperience with anything serious, or those self-deprecating thoughts. "So if we were to work on empowering this...resonance...I would be able to see that in you more consistently, potentially without touch? Is there anything else it would do? I have no desire to actually read your mind or anything like that; I honestly have no desire to read your emotions either but if that's part of the package deal that's...that's not so bad, as long as you're okay with and consenting to it."
Star Lumina	Star smiled as Ellesandra cut themselves off. "Nothing to apologize for," she said quietly. She set her hand back in her own lap after Ellesandra turned back towards her. She kept a close eye on their emotional state. It seemed to be on the upturn, so she was reassured by that. She nodded to Ellesandra's assessment. "You'd be able to see it, eventually. Not right away. But the more sensitive you become to my aura, the more visible it becomes, until it would always be visible. Right now you can probably only see it when it's surging with mana from my own emotions. As for if it would do anything else?" She pursed her lips a moment to the side. "I...Can't say for certain either way. It was around the time I was learning about this concept that everything happened and I was separated from my mother. Mind-reading isn't really the purview of auramancy though, so I wouldn't worry about that. And, Ellesandra, the whole point of me just showing you all that just now was...At least mostly just to show you that I have nothing I care to hide from you, including my aura, my emotions. I'm an open book to you. You don't have to worry about consent on that matter with me, though I understand it's still reassuring to hear it said unambiguously that yes, I am okay and agree to you seeing it any time."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra's emotions were on the upturn in the way that someone who swept all their dirty clothes into their closet cleaned their room. It was still there, just...pushed aside for now. Still something she needed to address and until she did, the romantic feelings she had for Star probably wouldn't be able to go anywhere. Either way though, she nodded. "I understand that in this moment of time you're consenting, Star, but the thing is - your emotions change. Your ideas change. If something happens at a later date that you want to hide from me, you won't be able to. Maybe it's a small pet peeve, not worth calling me out on, but it bothers you every time I do it even if I enjoy it. You won't be able to hide that to prevent tension between us." That was a personal example, since she had a decent amount of frustration with her inability to hide her own frustration at the lack of emotional privacy. This showed on the travel before they got to Myst. "Anyways, though. Let's assume there won't be an issue or you'll tell me and we can stop this connection if there is, later. For now, what do we do with that connection? How do you use magic through it that would be able to help me in a fight? Or vice versa, though I don't know if any of my magic would be able to effect you, or if it would be beneficial at all."
Star Lumina	Star just kept smiling through Ellesandra's words. "...I feel like I'm not really getting across what my auramancy means to me," she said brightly. A pleasant statement, not a judgmental or frustrated one. "I understand what you're saying. I understand this is a one way decision, no going back. I'm still saying yes. I won't ever want to hide from you, no matter what my emotions towards you are. Good or bad, embracing honesty and openness with all those around me is what it means to be me. I've had struggles, of course. Times of doubt. I might get upset about it in the future but...The darkness passes, when you allow it to. And the most true, strongest bonds, aren't forged out of a lifetime without conflict. They are forged through facing the weaknesses in them and making a bond stronger for it." She looked up at the stars as she spoke these words, smiling to herself. She then looked back at Ellesandra. "Sorry. Didn't mean to go on about all that. For now...Nothing has been done with the connection. Nothing substantial anyway. It allows me to use my sympathetic healing on you easily. But we would need to be together, touching in one way or another, while focusing on the connection to strengthen it. It won't really work with your armor on. Skin to skin contact is necessary for this. Just, uhm," she hastily continued, her face going red as she realized the implications of what she was saying. And while it was true that...more intense, more full skin-on-skin contact made it easier, she wasn't suggesting that. "You know. Holding hands, in meditation. That sort of thing." Awkward glance away, deep breath... "Uh. But once we can do that, it will...Well. I don't know yet. Depends entirely on how strong we can make it. But even if we just nudge it along a tiny bit, it should be enough to let me empower you with some enhanced focus, at the very least. The stronger the resonance, the more powerful magic I can evoke with it."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra listened as Star kind of rambled about Auramancy. In a way, it was cute. If she hadn't just gone through an emotional upheaval, she might have smiled while watching it. Right now, though, she just watched and tried to take in the information. Some of it went over her head, just a matter of not fully understanding the extent of Star's emotional vulnerability and openness, or how it all worked overall. When the skin to skin contact was suggested she pulled back, surprised and her mind going to exactly what you would think it would at that. Star clarifying even just holding hands would help made her nod. "Oh, um. Well we can't do that right now, but when we're back in the room maybe?" She looked down at her armor. Arguably, she wouldn't have needed to wear it today, but that was assuming no one would attack while they were out and about in the city. That type of faith in the city was not one she had. "I don't want to do anything that will wear you out right now, so nothing strong in magic when we do. Just test to see what we can do, push the limits. Is there anything else? You don't seem to be very offensive in spells, but I also haven't seen you use any defensive spells other than that...armor thing you did. The grease spell helped to control the battlefield. Do you have anything else like that, outside of our...resonance?"
Star Lumina	Star gently nodded at the notion of doing it back in the room as she took her cocoa in hand and set about sipping from it, now that it was cooler. "Building resonance won't wear me out. Kinda the opposite, it's meditative, so it'll be restorative. Not that I'm...Really in need of any more rest at this point or anything. Uhm. When it comes to what I can do, you saw I can make a bright flash for offense, though it's relatively short range and requires the enemy have eyes I can blind, or if they are close enough it can produce a bang loud enough to disorient them for a little. For the average bandit it's usually enough to make them fumble around for a minute or so, long enough to get away, but it's risky to do if I'm alone. People tend to see a magic user doing magic things and respond by stabbing them," she said with a half-joking nervousness. Ellesandra ought to know exactly what it meant to see a magic user and be trained to physically 'persuade' them to not do whatever they were doing. "But that is also auramancy. I know a handful of arcane cantrips and spells, mostly enchantment, abjuration, and divination stuff. Armor of Agathys, Alarm, Dancing Lights, Goodberry, Faerie Fire, Hold Person, Cure Wounds...I've learned a good number of spells, but arcane spells aren't as natural to me as auramancy. The defensive magic armor you see me use was what my mother called the Chromatic Wall. She tried to teach me how to do what she called Chromatic Lance, but I haven't been able to get that to work for me. If I can physically touch an enemy, I can reliably put them to sleep or temporarily paralyze them, but I'm sure you can see the dilemma that I try to avoid getting close to people who wanna hurt me. Oh, and it might be a little obvious but I can see invisible people. All the time. Like, they're still invisible, but they can't hide their aura, so...I can still see their outline."
Ellesandra	Well, yeah building resonance might not wear her out but she didn't want Star to practice using this...Chromatic Wall on Ellesandra as a test and wearing herself out with it. She took in a deep breath, still feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of this resonance, but knowing that it was beneficial and worth it in the long run. She took a sip of the cocoa, letting the warm chocolate soothe her insides as if it could actually soothe the emotional turmoil in her. There was interest - and a small bit of being impressed - at the idea of Star being able to see invisible people. That was a lovely little benefit, along with the idea of putting people to sleep or paralyzing them if touched, but she smiled. "You're right, someone uses magic on a battlefield they become a target. Unfortunately I'm pretty sure our enemies already know you can use magic, so no use holding back anymore." There were a few moments pause, and then - "So all that is left would be to practice this resonance? We can do so tonight a little before bed, if you would like. I think you know everything I can do, generally, and unfortunately I doubt any of my magic will work on you even through the resonance. Or if it did your body wouldn't be built for it, as physical of a magic it is."
Star Lumina	"Oh, I should clarify I don't need to see them specifically, my aura sense works all around me, but vision is probably the easiest and most reliable," she said, hastily clarifying before Ellesandra responded. At the summation, she nodded, then sipped more of her cocoa. "I would like that, yes. And I can't really say I know what to expect with how your magic will interact with mine. Not like there's much past evidence to go on. And I'm not even an expert on my own magic to begin with so..." She gently shrugged. "I'm excited to find out what's to come, if you are. Anything that helps us stay safe and healthy out there is good in my books." Big smile, then more sipping cocoa. She was starting to get quite the taste for it, not just because of her sweet tooth, but just...Associating such nice memories with it, being here with Ellesandra...It might just one day be her own comfort drink of choice.
Ellesandra	She let the silence stretch after Star finished speaking that time. She just sipped at her cocoa, looking up into the sky. Yep, this definitely was not a date. If it had been, she'd be able to look Star in the eye, right? Not just stare out at the oddly bright night that Myst provided and sip a comfort drink, trying not to panic about baring emotions together with Star. It just had to be someone that was so emotion-focused she ran into, didn't it? Someone who would force her to process shit. It had only been that morning that she'd broken down and let some of the mountain free, let the grief overwhelm her and sobbed in Star's arms. She took a deep breath again and shook her head. "Well, lets head to the room and get started, then. No use delaying it, it won't make it easier or better." She was hoping that Star forgot about her mentioning that she needed to process something. It...no longer felt like it was appropriate to bring those memories up for Star, since they involved Ellesandra having romantic feelings for someone other than Star. No, best to just try to process that on her own later tonight, the pain that had come up with Amelia's jabs at it being like a date being packed down tightly for now.
Star Lumina	Star certainly had a lot more to talk about, and was in no rush to build the resonance with Ellesandra. There would be time. She gently took them by the wrist, signaling them to stay seated. They hadn't seen a single other person all this time, after all, and she got the feeling Ellesandra would feel better out here than in the room. Maybe, maybe not. "There'll be time tonight. There's no rush, and I don't imagine it will be difficult either way. Let's just...Stay a little longer, Ellesandra. It might be our last peaceful night for a while. I want to talk more. Not about tactics, or 'us'...About you. It's not like I haven't see the way your jaw clenches when you're fighting back your emotions. I watch you stuff them away, even though that doesn't really...Do anything but delay the inevitable." She paused a moment, letting those words sit. "...I care about you, Ellesandra. I know there are things you need to let out, even if you've fought me on that all this time. Cocoa helps you process stuff so...Let's put that cocoa to work while I'm here with you to do my part, too."
Ellesandra	There was a flash of anger, irritation at being stopped and told she needed to process things. It wasn't really anger at Star, it was more her emotions being stretched thin. For someone who had spent so much of her life not feeling them, learning to push them down and just distract herself from them, compartmentalize them and forget them - the past few days had been an emotional tidal wave. Between the overwhelming emotions felt from the armor's magic, to the realization of feelings for Star, to Star's aura burst - or whatever - and having to pull jealousy and all of those feelings from her, to breaking down and finally letting herself grieve Marigold, and then the fear, trepidation, and panic at the idea of returned feelings? Ellesandra didn't have the emotional stamina she did physical; she was emotionally strung out, so the anger was a quick lash out. She didn't say anything, to her credit, only clenched her jaw and fell back into her seat with a huff that was more childish than she'd ever admit later, but Star would be able to see the anger nonetheless. She took a sip of the cocoa to cool herself down before she responded, to ensure her words weren't lashing out per say, even if they still had irritation and anger in them. "Have I not processed enough today, Star? I...the other thing I mentioned isn't a good idea to bring up right now, and I don't really have the emotional fortitude to go through what that might cause if I did bring it up right now. So can we just, not?" She said this, but that hadn't gotten rid of the small bit of remembered pain that was still there. How she'd been holding onto it since Amelia's words. And how, at least until the feelings were felt, she'd been a little excited to think of another bit of her past she could share with Star without it being too much. Piecemeal, type situation.
Star Lumina	Star certainly saw the anger. She wasn't going to push too hard, but she also knew that if she never pushed, Ellesandra would keep to their status quo until it became too much. She didn't like what she saw when they made their agreement of 'no death'. There wasn't the necessary conviction behind Ellesandra's words. She remained unconvinced, so to her, this was the only way she knew how to help. "We don't have to...But why isn't a good idea to bring up? If you're worried about...Upsetting me...Or something like that, then, please don't. I'll be upset if you lash out at me or speak to me in anger, but...If you're just sharing your heart with me, even if the emotions are...Hard...I'll be okay. If it's something else, then, well...Talk to me about it. I'm proud and...Happy as can be with all that I know you have let free from that cage in your heart. But I did promise you it would get worse before it gets better, didn't I? So...We don't have to do anything but...I'd like to just talk a little about you. I like you. I like hearing about you. I already talk too much."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra kind of just...shrugged when Star asked why it wasn't a good idea. After a moment, considering, she added. "When you...had that reaction in our room. The aura poisoning, or whatever it was called. Jealousy was a large part of that." She paused, then continued. "I, um. What I was going to share has to do with at least two other women, one I've been intimate with and one not. But, now that I've felt - well." Now that she'd felt that Star really did like her, had strong romantic feelings for her, and that this is probably where the jealousy had stemmed from - though Ellesandra still wasn't sure who or what Star had been jealous of - she had realized that sharing such parts of her past might not exactly be the best thing for their companionable relationship. She looked over to Star and shook her head. "And, I had no real plan to talk about it, either. I was going to share a memory again. Well, two of them really. Same day but separate situations." Ellesandra was not comfortable talking about herself. And, well, Star had provided a crutch for sharing information without talking about it. Ellesandra would probably take advantage of that, at least as much as Star let her, for the bits of herself she did feel comfortable and want to share with her.
Star Lumina	Star gave a soft smile. "It's not like I expect a woman as beautiful as you to be a kissless virgin like me," she said with a bit of a blush. "The poison feeling you felt wasn't actually the jealousy that made me sick. But when I was sick, those poison emotions just got stronger. It's a bit of a...Cascade of failure when it happens. Truthfully I haven't had that happen to me for a long time, a few times since getting separated from my mother, but not again since, well, just the other day. It's not like I can't deal with jealousy. It's...Certainly a new feeling for me, which is why I'm struggling with it. But like these other feelings I know I just...Need to let myself feel it, and let my heart become familiar with all these new feelings. They're still raw. But I'm not gonna lose my mind and fall ill every time you look at a hot professor with a sword," she said, keeping her smile as she rather specifically called out how Ellesandra looked at professor Chamberlain with attraction to try and prove a point that she could handle it. "When it comes to your past, well. The way I feel about it is that, hopefully at least, these people you wanted to talk about, or show me, made past-you happy. It's not like they are actively here, in front of you, threatening to take you away from me. That...Might evoke some deserved jealousy," she said with a small, nervous chuckle. "The only thing I can say is that I'd uh...Prefer to have my first time seeing you, uh...intimately...be something special, between us, if it were ever to happen, rather than through a memory. If it can't be helped, then it can't be helped. Just, y'know. If that part isn't important. And if I'm just making a fool of myself talking about all this when you never planned to actually show me any intimate moments like that in the first place then feel free to interrupt me any time, a-ahahahah...aha..hm.."
Ellesandra	She blinked, dumbfounded at the comment of a hot professor with a sword. She hadn't even realized, or thought about, how her attraction to Professor Chamberlain had probably been noticed by Star. Was that why she'd gotten a little upset? The surprise, and then a little bit of amusement, was obvious. The amusement only increased as Star commented about whether Ellesandra would share a memory of her being intimate. She had to bite her lip not to laugh at Star's bumbling words at the end, though she didn't interrupt Star. Not because she intended to share that, but because her rambling like that was...cute. And Ellesandra enjoyed watching it. "No, Star, I wasn't about to show myself and Sophia in the throes of passion. That would be a good way to show you what I like in bed though." The last comment was made with absolutely no intention to follow through on sharing that, but just tease Star and see how red she could make the mage's face. She had to fight down the smirk at the teasing, trying not to let themselves get too much into that dynamic so that those emotions didn't...build. She took another sip of her cocoa to distract herself from thoughts of being intimate with Star. They wouldn't be good things to focus on when they were going to be 'resonating' together later. Goodness, that sounded like an innuendo. "Like I said, two memories. Is that something that can be done, just like - blend one into the next? Or do we need to come out of one then go into the other? Also...is it safe to do that here? Or should we go back to our room?" She had kept her eyes closed while focusing on it before, so she wasn't quite sure how much either of them could be aware of their surroundings while doing this.
Star Lumina	Star slowly worked herself up into a blush with her rambling. It didn't get any better when Ellesandra came out boldly and talked about showing her what they liked in bed, which had her whole face shooting up bright pink, and a stunned expression landing on her face. Any hotter and steam would shoot out her ears. She didn't even get the chance to remark on how she also knew someone named Sophia, as an offhanded remark just to be involved in the conversation. No, too busy now feeling her heart pound out her ears. A little bit of time was needed for her to collect herself. "U-Uhm," she began, clearing her throat. "B-Blending uh...One into another is easy. And I'm still aware of our surroundings and nearby auras while in that state so...Promise I'll snap us out of it if needed."
Ellesandra	Star's absolutely beet red face almost made Ellesandra laugh out loud. God, whoever ended up being intimate with Star was going to be in for an awkward and probably silly and fun first experience. As Star confirmed she could keep an eye on their surroundings while receiving the memories though, Ellesandra glanced around. A sweep for danger, and a slight discomfort at having to rely on Star for that awareness rather than being able to do it herself. Still, this was a bit more comfortable than doing it up in their room. She wasn't quite sure how she wanted to approach this. She sipped more of the cocoa, it almost gone now. She didn't want to finish it, wanting to let the little bit of warmth and smell still in there seep into her nose, the comforting olfactory sensation soothing. "Okay." She said, and then began doing the gauntleted sections of her armor so that she could reach out and physically touch Star. It probably wasn't necessary - Ellesandra didn't remember for sure - but it felt like it would be something that would help. If asked, she'd say she thought it would help the memory transfer, but in reality, it would help Ellesandra. She ensured the cocoa and their food plates were set to the side where they wouldn't get damaged, and then she reached out to take one of Star's hands in both of hers. Her eyes closed, and she would work to put herself in the same state she did last time she shared memories, trying to calm her nerves down. It might take a moment, and just like before she'd follow the instructions that Star gave her to do so and help guide her into opening her 'aura' - or whatever - to sharing the memory she was focusing on. Star would find them sitting in what looked to be some sort of Mess Hall, mid day based on the brightness of the sun coming through windows. Ellesandra, older than the last memory at around 18, was sitting at a table with a handful of people around her. Ellesandra was dressed in basic training leathers with a shield strapped to her back, and a longsword strapped to her left hip. Her hair was up in it's customary pony tail, and she was sitting up, eating what looked to be a hearty lunch with the poise and manners of a noble. To her left sat a tall, blue skinned man - Aeras. An Air Genasi, he was dressed similarly to Ellesandra except his weapon was a warhammer, and he hadn't brought his shield along to lunch. He towered over Ellesandra, a 6'2 height compared to her 5'1, with black white hair that was cut short and a matching goatee. His build was wide, obviously physically stronger than Ellesandra along with the height difference. He was also older, though not quite so old that he had lines on his face; maybe mid to late twenties. Across the table sat a few other trainees, all guys around Ellesandra's age. "El, what are you plans for the festival tonight?" One of them asked, looking up from having picked up a slice of ham and just shoved it in his mouth, not using utensils at all. Ellesandra and Aeras appeared to be the only mannered ones there right now.. To Star's vision, she'd be able to see interest, attraction in him when he looked at Ellesandra. Ellesandra did not return the feelings at all though, in fact there was a bit of dismay and irritation at him asking. And a hidden bit of happiness at what she was thinking about after the question. "Oh, nothing." She said, in a way that implied there was very much something. Aeras smirked, elbow hitting Ellesandra's arm in a brotherly style of nudge. "Didn't the Princess invite you out to watch the fireworks on her balcony, Ellie?" In Aeras, Star would see affection - but not romantic or lustful. It was like that of an older brother, one who Ellesandra had trained with and grown up with in some ways. Ellesandra fought off a blush, her stoic mask and poker face not betraying her to her friends, but inside that happiness seemed to ignite. And there was definite embarrassment. "Yeah, so?" She responded, just as another feminine voice said from over her shoulder - "Oh, deed sheh now?"
Ellesandra	Sophia had walked up and plopped down right next to Ellesandra, her plate being set on the table with a little more force than had really been necessary. She also was taller than Ellesandra, but only just at 5'4. She was much more full-figured though, a bit thicker and with curves in a way that showed she ate well, and wasn't ashamed of it. Red, wavy hair hung down to mid back, and she chewed with an undisguised glare at Ellesandra. There was definite jealousy leaking out of every pore of her aura, enough that even those without the ability to see her Aura could tell she was jealous. Her accent was heavy, even more so when her temper was about to flare. "Sohnds lyke uh dayte, Ellie." Ellesandra looked sheepish, and confused, over at Sophia. While Star would be able to see not only the jealousy, but actual romantic interest strongly flaring for Ellesandra, Ellesandra's emotions in response were very much not matching. There was strong physical attraction, lust, for Sophia - but absolutely no romantic spark at all. And at her jealous, Ellesandra was both confused and exasperated. There was also a spark of hope at the idea of this being a date with Marigold, but she didn't show that at all. "No it's not a date, she's the Princess. But Soph, we've been through this. What you and I have is physical, I thought we were on the same page there? Even if it was - and AGAIN, it's NOT - that shouldn't bother you?" Oh but to be as naïve with emotions as Ellesandra was, especially at this age. Sophia was obviously hurt by this comment, and there was second hand embarrassment from all around. Sophia grunted and grabbed her plate back up. "Nehva mind, Aye'll sit elsewhere where em wanted." She stalked off, though she didn't sit elsewhere. She just dumped her food and stomped out of the mess hall, ignoring the looks. Ellesandra just looked even more confused and looked around. "What did I do? You all KNOW that I told her I wasn't interested in a relationship, right? I did that in front of people? I'm just not into her that way." "Yeah." Aeras confirmed, then added. "But she's into you that way, El. You can't expect her to just not have those emotions just because you don't." She rolled her eyes, waving a hand. "Well, that's not my fault is it? I was very upfront with her about it. She's a good lay, but there just isn't anything there beyond that." The guys on the other side of the table snickered, but Aeras shook his head. "You're a pig sometimes Ellesandra. You're taking advantage of her interest in you just because she looks like-" Ellesandra felt anger - and a little bit of shame she'd never admit - and slammed her fist down onto the table. "I am NOT!" And then one of the guys across the table cut in - "Why are you so interested in Princess Marigold anyways? Weren't ya like, raised with her? Itn't she more like a sis to ya or something? That's kinda weird." Which did exactly as he had intended. It cut off Ellesandra's anger at Sophia and Aeras, only to have it directed at him. "Shut the fuck up John, I'm not interested in her like that." The denial was real, even to someone without being able to see Auras. Whoever this Princess Marigold was, Ellesandra was all but head over heels for her. Aeras put a gentle, calming hand on Ellesandra's shoulder. "Hey, just be careful okay? You could do a lot worse than Sophia, but if you aren't interested in her you shouldn't join her bed when she has actual feelings involved." He spoke with the soothing, gentleness of someone teaching a lesson to a younger child. From most people, it would have pissed Ellesandra off. From him? She just sighed. "I thought I avoided that issue by making it clear, though. It was just physical." "Yeah, and then you stayed all night and cuddled, and kept going back." John added in, smirking. "Hell, I'd do the same too if she we-" He was cut off by Ellesandra grabbing a roll and tossing it at him, hitting him right in the face. "Shut your mouth John." There was...a protective streak for Sophia. Not out of romantic affection, but it was just Ellesandra's nature to protect those she was close to - friend or lover or romantic interest.
Ellesandra	This is where the memory began to fade. Ellesandra felt shame for the memory and how she'd treated Sophia, along with a pain in regards to the 'it seems like a date' comments. She forced it into the next memory before Star could comment though. They were directly related, and honestly she was terrified she wouldn't have the strength or willpower to go on if she stopped now. The world shifted into black and then into the next memory, where Ellesandra was standing on a balcony of a castle. It was overlooking castle grounds, able to see the walls in the distance, and then the city just beyond it. The ocean was to the west, moonlight reflecting off of it. There were a lot of lights from the town and the sound of festivities, music being played and townspeople having fun. Ellesandra was dressed nicer than she had been earlier that day, in a suit that would befit a nobleman. It was a light silver-blue color with gold emboss on it, obviously tailored specifically to Ellesandra. It hugged her well despite being a man's suit, fitting to her more muscular statue but still hugging the curves on her chest and hips enough to make her look attractive in it. Her hair was down from it's ponytail, at this point flowing down to mid back. She was leaning against the balcony, nerves alight and wringing her hands when there was a voice behind her - the same one that Star had heard when Ellesandra had cut off the first memory shared on the training grounds. "Ellie, I don't know why you insist on this stuff. I can't get you to eat a piece of the best cake I've ever had because you hate sweets but you'll drink this cocoa any chance you get." Marigold stepped into view as Ellesandra turned around, carrying two large mugs of the hot cocoa. Marigold was 5'5, beautifully kept red hair in an ornate braid that probably took servants a few hours to do in the morning, with a lightly freckled face and bright green eyes. She was wearing a green dress that complimented her hair and eyes well, hugging tight at the waist and bosom but flowing outwards around the legs. She held herself like you would expect any Princess to, even if she seemed more relaxed around Ellesandra. While in Ellesandra, though, you could see that romantic attraction, that hope, burning, Star would be able to see it in Marigold as well just...not towards Ellesandra. When she looked at Ellesandra, it was with a similar affection to that of Aeras'. Ellesandra took the cup and brought it close, immediately sniffing it and letting the warmth and the smell help calm some of her nerves. "You remember, the day you found me? It was the drink you shared with me then. It's my first memory of feeling...safe. You know? It was the most rich and exotic thing I'd tasted or smelled, and it kind of just stuck I guess." Marigold brightened at this, smiling wide with teeth. "Oh! I remember that. You liked it so much I gave you mine too. We were just trying to warm you up I think - it's been so long since then. Father of course wanted to just drop you off at the nearest orphanage." Ellesandra winced. There was pain there - obviously no real love lost between her and the King. "Yeah well, I'm pretty sure he still does. But you convinced him not to, right? I don't actually remember a whole lot from those first few days." Marigold nodded, moving to join Ellesandra at the balcony. She leaned on it with the cup in her hands, hanging out over the grounds while looking out at the festivities in town. "Yeah, Mother helped of course. I hadn't been making friends in the castle and when we found you out there, crying, so when I showed an interest she helped ensure that I could make a new friend if I wanted. I'm a couple years older is why I think I remember it better, but you also just lost your family. Not surprised you don't remember all of it." Ellesandra turned, leaning back against the balcony in a mirror of the posture Marigold had taken, except she was actually sipping at her cocoa while Marigold just held hers. There were more nerves in both of them as Ellesandra said - "You said you wanted to talk about something with me. Something important?" \
Ellesandra	Marigold nodded, not keeping her eyes away from the town. "It's been...fourteen? Fifteen years since we've met, Ellie. You've been by my side through so much, from helping me cheat in my Sylvan lessons to resigning from the main army to be my personal guard. I appreciate that more than you know; I can't imagine having anyone else standing beside me to support me when I take the crown." Marigold didn't mean this the way Ellesandra had taken it, which was a huge spark in those romantic feelings. She had even blushed, though Marigold wasn't looking at her and didn't notice. "Father talked to me today, and...well. We've found someone that we think would be a good person for me. Someone I'm interested in too." At this, Ellesandra looked over to Marigold. Now there was confusion. Her father had never liked Ellesandra, and if Marigold was talking about her, that made no sense. But she was talking about Ellesandra, right? These were the concerned and emotions going through young Ellesandra's aura right then. "Would you be my sister, and Maid of Honor in my wedding to Prince-" The rest of the words just...didn't register to Ellesandra. There was...heartbreak. From an aura standpoint, it was perfectly clear to see. It was as if those emotions had been taken away from all source of fire and dumped into water. The sad thing was, the flames remained. They struggled to survive, while it felt like Ellesandra was literally drowning. Yet through it all, Ellesandra kept a stoic poker face. A disassociated one, that happened almost immediately after the realization of what Marigold was saying sank in. "Of course, Marie." She heard herself say, as if it wasn't herself. The day that had been meant to be a date, that she had denied yet hoped so strongly for it to be so - had resulted in the Ellesandra that began to learn how to disassociate from it all. Whenever something like that happened, she began building that mountain. This wasn't the day that Marigold had died, but this was the day the foundation of the mountain had been built. And that was where the memory faded, back to Ellesandra who was immediately pulling away from Star, turning her body to face away and struggling to contain the pain that had been brought back in full force at it. Not only that rejection she'd felt there, but the later grief of still losing her. (done)
Star Lumina	Star had a lot to think about as she watched these two memories play out. She had a great deal of things, angles, emotions, to consider. It was, like so very many other emotional matters, a complex thing. Someone was falling for Ellesandra. Ellesandra didn't return it, and had what she felt confident calling at least a precursor to love in Ellesandra towards Marigold. It was strong. It had to be. It couldn't hurt so much otherwise. But whether it truly befit the word love was difficult to know for certain unless she focused on the emotion for a while. Time, she did not have. There were obvious parallels to the current situation. It gave meaning to the hot cocoa. It gave meaning to why Ellesandra was so emotionally closed off. It gave a name to the woman, Marigold, whose handkerchief Ellesandra still carried. But it had Star thinking about what she'd seen in Ellesandra's aura when she suggested the notion of whether the power Ellesandra might have with the card would be enough to revive someone. To revive Marigold was the obvious desire she saw spark in them. But Marigold didn't return Ellesandra's feelings. That was...Obvious, wasn't it? Not that it was the only reason Ellesandra would want to revive them, but she did sincerely worry if it might be something the woman considered as a chance to be with the princess again as a lover. A chance to bridge feelings that weren't reciprocated. A desperate emotion, certainly. Not one she blamed Ellesandra for, but one that was suffuse with poison for one's heart all the same. When everything was done, Star coming back to focus, she didn't stop Ellesandra from turning away. But she did scoot closer so she could reach one arm across Ellesandra's back and rest on their opposite shoulder while moving to lean her head on them. "...There's nothing that you would have needed to worry about in sharing all that, Ellesandra. Love, in all its forms, whether it is fully blossomed or simply budding, or sparking and yet to form fully, is a beautiful thing. And she was a beautiful woman. The bond you two shared...I couldn't possibly know all there is to it. But even with what little you showed me, it is clear how much she meant to you. Though your story is rife with tragedies I...Hope there are still happy, beautiful memories you can hold onto. You don't have to talk right now, if you're still letting yourself feel. We don't have to talk. We can just...Be here. But...If there is anything about that you want to say...I would really want to hear it."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra kept her back to Star, even as she felt a hand on her shoulder. She seemed to be keeping well enough control of her pain, at least enough that she wasn't crying. However, the fact the pain was there, raw and sore, didn't change. How Amelia's comment about this being a date had reminded her of Sophia, and how poorly she'd treated the healer then. How she didn't want to do the same to Star. How the idea of that being a date, because they had cocoa out amongst the stars, was one that brought back some very real heartbreak. It was why she'd lashed out, for Amelia daring to make her feel that again, even unintentionally. The thing is, she had loved Marigold. Whether she was in love could be debated. Was it the type of 'true love' that people aspired to? No, but Ellesandra also didn't believe in such a thing. Yet she felt it was important to reprocess that memory and feeling, since it was the source of where the mountain grew. Where she had begun truly putting her emotions aside, since it had been necessary to do her job. She stood by Marigold as she'd been married, and if Ellesandra hadn't protected herself the way she had, she wouldn't have been able to do that. "What is there to say?" She asked, after a lengthy silence. Her voice was hoarse from holding the pain in. But unlike before, she wasn't pushing it down. She was just holding it back enough she didn't break down. "That was the start of me doing this. That's...that's all."
Star Lumina	Star slowly closed her eyes, just taking a moment to be against Ellesandra. To be close to them. To comfort them. Her presence was always that much more comforting because of her auramancy; being able to connect with someone on a level below the surface and have one soul speak to another and say silently 'I am here for you'. It did not mend emotional wounds the way magic could close a bleeding gash. But it certainly would help Ellesandra keep composed as those emotions were allowed to flow through them as Star would say they should have been the whole time. "There's a lot you...COULD say. But if you don't want to say anything, that's okay, too. If you want to talk? Then you can tell me about what you're feeling. Tell me whatever comes to mind when you feel it. Tell me the good times with Marigold. Tell me what you liked about Sophia. Tell me about the times you weren't trying to beat the snot out of your comrades in arms. Tell me about you, Ellesandra. Those are things you can say, if you want to. Everyone deals with pain in their own way. I just...Want to help you so you are actually dealing with it, not...Ignoring it. It's been hurting you this whole time and...I don't much like anything that hurts you."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra reached for the cocoa, even though it was empty. She brought the empty mug and held it in both of her now bare hands, squeezing tightly on the mug. Her lips pursed and she closed her eyes, trying to think of something positive. Good times with Marigold were out of the picture - they would bring up too much pain with her gone now, even if they were good times. Sophia was an option. She didn't know when she wasn't trying to beat the snot out of her comrades in arms - though that was entirely just their relationship and how they showed they cared for one another. Except Aeras, but he hadn't really been a 'comrade' per say. He'd been established before she'd met him, and she was still in training. "I met Sophia." She started, trying to focus about that. Focusing on something that would distract her from the pain she felt. "When I first came back from my squireship. I was...about fifteen?" Keeping a specific age when she didn't know her age upon being found was hard. But around that age. "Sixteen, maybe. Old enough to know I liked girls, young enough to not understand the difference between lust and love. She's a healer, and she's...well, she's the type of healer who will hit a patient over the head if they're being difficult and knock them out so she can do her job. Fiery. And it shouldn't have been a thing to even be concerned about, but she was so...unapologetically herself. There were people who tried to bully her because she was bigger than a lot of the other soldiers, healers, women, and she just put their head under her arm and gave them a knuckle sandwich." A shake of her head. "Woman had a self confidence I could only dream of."
Star Lumina	Star smiled. That was nice. It might have been strange for Ellesandra that hearing them talk nicely about a woman from their past they were sexually involved in didn't inspire jealousy in Star. Of course, Star wanted that intimacy. There might be a tiny hint of envy, just that she wanted what others had but she didn't, but Star was simply...Not an envious person. Her first foray into romantic affection with Ellesandra certainly was making her feel all kinds of nasty things that came with the territory, but...When the initial period of this passed, she would come to master herself and be free of these jealous flareups at other people, too. Star gave a soft giggle. "It's easy to admire that sort of person, isn't it? People who know who they want to be, who can reach out and be that person, get over that fear...It can be inspiring. Rightly so. Because we can all do that, I believe. Just, well...Much, much easier said than actually done. Is that whole being knocked out to let her do her job something you're telling me from experience? Or did she just feel the same frustrations I have about regular healing being about as effective as kissing the wound and saying nice words at it? Because my goodness does it take everything out of me to fix you, eheh.." she paused a moment, then added, softer: "...But that's not gonna stop me from doing it every time. My heart can't bear to see you hurt."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra shook her head, though it was mostly at herself. "Yeah, I kept telling her that healing me was useless and she may have hit me over the head hard enough to make my vision blur. And by the time I was looking around again, she had already expended a lot of energy to heal the small cut I had." She squeezed at the mug a little, feeling a little uncomfortable at what Star had said. There was...definitely a response at the idea of 'kissing the wound and saying nice words at it'. There was arousal with it. The thing was, Sophia had done exactly that before. Granted not for a serious wound, but still. "I'm sorry healing doesn't work right on me. And that the only way you can actually do it is to take the pain on yourself, which I'm still not comfortable with." She shrugged a little, but then finally began to turn back to sitting forward on the bench. The mug of empty cocoa still in her hands, she glanced briefly over to Star. "I hate this stuff, Star." The words sounded defeated, irritated. She wasn't, she was going through this whole processing shit, but she hated it. "I honestly don't know how you do it."
Star Lumina	Star smiled at the memory. It might have been a bit troublesome at the time, but being able to reminisce on it now, knowing that Sophia was doubtlessly doing their best, even if maybe a little misguided, felt nice. Star shook her head, adjusting to ensure Ellesandra could sit how they wanted, though she kept contact with them, even if that was just keeping her head on their shoulder. "That's not the only way I can do it, that's just the easy way. I'm practiced enough as a healer that I can manage to mend even more serious stuff on you, it just...Takes a lot. A lot more than it ought to. I want to use my sympathetic healing more, but...You being comfortable takes priority so long as it's not an emergency." She then smiled again, hearing Ellesandra say how much she hated it. "I know you do. And one might say I have a bit of an unfair advantage in being so attuned to this stuff. Those same people might say you have an unfair advantage when the matchup is you versus someone who only knows magical offense. We each have our gifts. But...Truly, my powers don't give me any special capacity to deal with emotion. For a long time when I was young, I was sick. My mother told me that the same was true of her. And if the day comes that I have a child, it'll be the same for them, most likely. I was born with my powers, after all. So the world has always looked this way to me. You, well...I showed you what it's like to see just me. But remember that I not only see everyone that way, but I see...Clouds of emotion. Lingering remnants of powerful emotion and the memories, the moments that created them. The world to me is a sea of colours. And it's a beautiful thing to me, truly. But as a child? It was terrifying. Confusing. Any time I didn't understand why I felt a certain way, it had that chance of going out of control and making my aura...'break', so to say. The only source of comfort in my life, the only place that made sense, was when I was with my mom. Whenever she held me, the world felt calm. The world felt like it made sense. The colours, instead of being...Noisy, and blinding, became soft and inviting. Changed from the sounds that remind me of iron swords clashing on a battlefield to the sounds of birds singing their sweet songs. There was guidance, yes, but...It truly came down to just...Exposing myself to it all and letting it live in me so I could feel it, understand it, and come to a better understanding of myself through it all. That's all this is, Ellesandra. These things in your heart aren't going anywhere when you shove them away. Bringing it back up can be hard, I know. I'll say it again...It gets worse, before it gets better. But even these dark emotions are part of you, beautiful in their own way, for they morph into something genuinely bright and beautiful once they have had time to live in you for the time they need. Hurt gives way to strength. Loss gives way to the want for love again. Sorrow gives way for happiness. Denial gives way to acceptance. Turbulence...Gives way to peace. It's a never ending battle, Ellesandra. But if you want a small example...I remember seeing how you felt when that evil man called you short, thinking he was so funny. I can only imagine the kind of trouncing you have given to people over the years, people who have underestimated you for your stature, only to find that your fiery determination was a thousand times greater than they ever imagined it could be. You being a tiny bit on the shorter end for a woman is just...One part of who you are." She moved a hand to gently take Ellesandra's bare hand to squeeze it, here, arriving at the culmination of her point: "I can tell you from experience...Once the storm passes, you feel better. There's light at the end of it all. And for whatever it's worth...You're not facing any of it alone."
Ellesandra	She took in a deep breath, shaking her head. She hated how it took everything out of a healer to heal her, and the alternative for Star hurt her. Though in a way, it was nice to know that it was still an option, even if Ellesandra would never actually ask for it. She listened as Star continued on, explaining how it was overwhelming as a child and how she didn't just get good at this type of thing overnight, along with the prep talk about everyone being good at something. The short comment made her almost smirk, thinking about all of the times she'd been called a shorty on the training grounds and made people regret underestimating her for that. After a few moments, she moved to stand up, pulling away from Star. She did not leave, but just stepped away far enough to stretch and put some distance between them. On the one hand, Star touching her was comforting. On the other hand, it made her emotions even more difficult and hard to understand, what with how she enjoyed the touch. "Well." She said, trying to just...brush all of that off. To pretend that it was something small, not as big as it had been. "Are you ready to attempt this whole resonance thing? We can become musicians and resonate enough for a whole musical number." She was trying to joke, to lighten the mood and distract from the fact she was withdrawing again. It wasn't the same as before, but it was an active point of it being too much right now, and needing to get back to normal topics.
Star Lumina	Star could tell that even before all of that, Ellesandra needed a break. She needed to push them, needed to take the opportunity that presented itself, but even for someone who wanted Ellesandra to push through everything to feel better like Star it was obvious. A little levity. A little normalcy was needed. She was glad to be able to capitalize on this time together where it was safe, where they could focus on each other. But the time was nearly up. It was going to be time to go to Gurhal very soon, and once more deal with a lot of things that would distract from this. Star got up to join Ellesandra and mirrored their stretch. "We will make beautiful music together!" she said, ab-so-lutely unaware of what the implications of that phrase were. "I heard Nina say that to someone once," she said, turning her back to Ellesandra to get their dishes gathered. "She had a nice singing voice. Though I don't remember her girlfriend playing any musical instruments...Maybe they were a singer, too," she said, thinking aloud as she got things together to turn back to Ellesandra, ready to go along and return everything before going to their room where they could do their nightly rituals and get prepared for their attempted strengthening of their resonance.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra felt the corners of her mouth turn up at Star's comment. She considered long and hard whether or not to share the joke with Star, knowing it would make her blush up a storm - and potentially change how she felt about this Nina person and their girlfriend. After another moment, she decided to share the joke, if only to be fully honest to Star. "Making music together means making eachother orgasm loudly, Star." Her explanation was very dryly delivered, as if it were nothing to laugh at or to be ashamed of. She kept her stoic mask up while watching Star, preparing for her flustered response. She would head back to their room though, taking their dishes back to the bar first before going up to get out of her armor and everything. She went slowly about this, dreading the idea of working through this resonance and being able to see more of Star's emotions. And maybe potentially see how she felt about everything she'd seen in the memories before. She was nervous, but did not hold back from preparing, like you would when about to do a chore you disliked doing.
Star Lumina	Star froze in place. "Gah..." was the only sound that came from her as the joke was exposed. She at least knew how Nina was...Hardly surprising that they would make a joke like that, but boy oh boy did she not expect that to be what it meant nor did she intend on just saying that right out loud casually to Ellesandra. Yet at the same time, part of that made her...Excited. Aroused. It gave her a flash of desire to be touching Ellesandra intimately, to make good on that joke, make it real. Her legs and arms went a little numb at the cascade of thoughts, and she was subsequently silent the whole way back to the room. Things were dropped off, and Star insisted on taking a shower. Not that Ellesandra would know, but it was certainly a cold shower. She came back out dressed in the spare civilian clothes she had, wanting to keep her enchanted outfit decent for the next day where it might matter. Then, she moved to join Ellesandra on their bed, hair still damp behind them, and set about focusing. The position she assumed Ellesandra wanted to take was just cross-legged and facing each other, hands together, but there were...Options that would make it either easier or harder, depending on the amount of contact their bodies could make while performing this act.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't expect Star to completely go silent. For a moment, she felt guilty about sharing it, wondering if it had made her uncomfortable. By the time Star got out of the shower, Ellesandra had gotten out of her armor and and was in a spare set of clothes. She was sitting on her bed, looking up when Star came out, frowning. "I'm sorry, if that comment and explanation was too much, Star. I know you're still pretty new to all of this and..." She trailed off, not sure how to explain it. She just wanted Star to feel comfortable, and not forced or intimidated by any of the sexual comments Ellesandra might let slip occasionally, like when with Amelia. Still though, she had been sitting there, ready for whatever this resonance would be like. Her hands were bare, and her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows so there could be more contact there if needed. She wasn't sure what exactly Star would need for this, but she had mentioned that the more contact there was, the better the resonance would be. Ellesandra was entirely taking Star's lead for it though, not sure what to do.
Star Lumina	Star gently shook her head, blushing again. Ah, they brought it up again? She just got out of the cold shower... "It's not that any of that makes me uncomfortable, really. I mean. I'm an adult woman who has plenty of...Thoughts...Ideas.." Fantasies. "I've heard plenty from others. Just because I haven't actually done any of those things myself doesn't mean I haven't been exposed to it. If anything it makes me...W-Well..." She cleared her throat, hoping she wouldn't have to say it aloud. "Coming from you anyway," she added, much more quietly. A dirty joke from a sleezeball wouldn't get her going, obviously, but anything that put the mental image of Ellesandra and herself, together, intimately, in her mind? Well, there were obvious consequences. "N-Never mind that. That'll just distract from what we're trying to do!" she declared, moving to sit opposite Ellesandra, matching their posture with sleeves slowly rolled up so she could slip her hands along Ellesandra's forearms to grip at their elbows, or just before. Mirroring her was the obvious suggestion. Probably for the best they weren't taking on some extreme barely-clothed approach, because Star wasn't sure how well she could concentrate in such an intimate scenario, regardless of how beneficial the additional skin contact would be. Once they were situated in this position, Star closed her eyes. "...Just relax. Close your eyes, and focus on me. I will focus on you. It will take a bit of time where not much is going to feel like it's happening I think. But once we're doing it right, you should be able to feel...Me. And I should be able to feel you. Not just emotions, though there will be that. Not our thoughts, but...Each other's presence. The physical, the emotional, and spiritual. I've also been told there's a chance it'll have us be in a...Trance-like state, but other than that I don't really know what to expect. This is new territory for me, too so just...Bear with me."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra immediately felt more regret at having made the comment. It only brought to light again Star's feelings for her and her desire to be intimate in a way that Ellesandra was definitely not ready for. If Star had come to her and asked her to be fucked, with no emotional strings attached, Ellesandra would be happy to do that. But to be intimate in the way that Star surely wanted to be? The panic stirred again. She forced a swallow down and clenched her jaw shut for a moment, before mirror what Star was doing and closing her eyes as she was told to. She pushed these feelings back down, not wanting them to be a major point of interest while Star was touching her or they were trying to resonate. This felt...odd. She didn't answer Star's instructions, but she attempted to follow them. Ellesandra had meditated before - it had been part of her training in becoming one with her body and checking in on injuries or soreness in it. But her meditation previously had been very focused on doing physical body scans; this was just focusing on Star. And she struggled to do that without her thoughts going, which kept causing her to stop focusing on Star in order to push those thoughts down, then restart the whole process. Her hands squeezed Star's arms each time she had to restart, though unless something just immediately started to connect between them, Star would feel Ellesandra's frustration stirring. Ellesandra didn't act on it, the frustration at herself more a distraction than anything, but it would become noticeable as any time attempting this lengthened.
Star Lumina	Star could see the awkward regrets as the sexual jokes stirred feelings that Ellesandra didn't want to entertain. It was hard to feel this way about someone and actively see them trying so hard to not feel the same. Was it concern it would spiral out of control? It didn't matter in the moment. It was pushed aside. But even pushing it aside, it was not gone. So when the meditation began, each of them focused on each other, Star was given a very clear display of Ellesandra fighting against the feeling...And Ellesandra was given wave after wave of Star's romantic affection and attraction in turn. She did not fight it. So Ellesandra felt it all each time they focused on her. And each time focus broke, it lessened. Then each time the attempt to resume followed, it came flooding back. Each time Ellesandra broke concentration to fight with themselves, it put them back to square one. Not an ounce of progress was gained. "Ellesandra...You need to stay focused. You need to let everything flow naturally through you. Nothing is going to happen right now. Once you relax fully, no matter what you feel, it won't...Lead to any action. So please...Do you very best. Relax. Focus. Stop fighting with yourself."
Ellesandra	"Easier said than done." She muttered. Ellesandra was in strong denial about her feelings for Star. Her feelings were there, 100%. Star could see and, maybe, feel them in this. But there was so much fear packed around them. Self-doubt in her ability to be an actual partner to someone. Fear that she would let herself care for Star, like she'd cared for Marigold, and then she'd fail Star as her guard just as she did with Marigold. Fear of the past repeating itself. Fear that she was already too broken and too...not good for someone as innocent and pure as Star was. This was why she kept pushing those feelings down, which just became harder and harder the more she felt Star's feelings for her through their touch. Eventually, she was able to stay focused on Star for more than just a couple minutes at a time. Letting Star's emotions flow, and feel them, was foreign to her. Her natural response was to shove her barrier down, to split them up and not intrude upon Star's feelings. It wasn't even a lack of wanting to intrude, but also a recognition that she truly didn't want to feel what Star was feeling. Yet, she tried to. The affection and attraction, and any other feelings that Star sent through, Ellesandra began making their own little corner in her own emotional being that she sent them. She felt them, briefly, but began trying to instead of dwelling on them, push them to the side inside herself just like she did with her own emotions. To keep them separate from herself, so as to not confuse their affection and attraction towards one another as mutual, even if it definitely was.
Star Lumina	As much as Ellesandra may try, they unfortunately would not have the same degree of control over Star's emotions that were felt through this connection that Ellesandra had over their own emotion. Redirection, putting it in a cage, trying to not feel it wasn't possible, as it wasn't Ellesandra's to feel or not feel. It was Star's. To manipulate that would require an adeptness with auramancy that only one of these two women had. There was already a clear divide; the feelings were intrinsically understood within Ellesandra's heart to not be their own emotions. Just as with Star's calm, her inner serenity, her happiness, her tiny flecks of frustrations and fears and doubts and all the other small emotions she wasn't actively feeling, but was there. Star, likewise, felt the mutual attraction, felt the fear and doubt that caged it. She knew the whole time that it was there, but she wasn't going to shove that in Ellesandra's face. They had to face all of those things at their own pace. She could guide them, she could comfort them, but she could not force them. But Star's attraction would not be felt as if it belonged to Ellesandra; any attraction, affection, or emotions of the sort that Ellesandra felt and understood to be their own were, simply, their own. But as difficult as this might all prove to be for Ellesandra, the extended length of focus achieved the spark of connection that Star had been trying to foster. And with that began a helpful feeling to combat all the fear and doubt and anxiety that Ellesandra felt: Calm. A relinquishing of physical feeling. Like their inner self was lifting out of them, wafting away to a dreamland. Ellesandra was being pulled into a trance. They could snap themselves out of it before it set in of course. But if they allowed it, then a soothing wave of unconsciousness would fall upon them, taking away all the inhibition and fears that made it so hard to focus on Star. And if they accepted, they would blissfully awaken looking up at a beautiful night sky filled with stars while laying in a field of pretty white flowers, clad in a pure, modest white sundress as the cool, refreshing night breeze tickled their skin. They could stand, look around, move around. But it was clear to them that they were not dreaming, nor strictly awake either. This was...A peaceful place. It was calm. Ellesandra was alone entirely, except for, of course...Star. She stood up a ways away on this infinite field of white flowers, clad in an identical white dress. They were too far away from each other to speak. But Ellesandra would be able to tell, be able to feel, that Star was there, and that she knew Ellesandra was there as well, and that Star was...Happy.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra might be able to recognize that they weren't her emotions to push to the side, but as she briefly felt them coming through her connection to Star, she had still tried. Failed, but tried. It was her go to reaction for emotions and things that made her uncomfortable, trying to separate them to deal with little bits at a time rather than all at once - or just not deal with them at all, as typically happened. She felt when the connection seemed to...snap into place. The calm that flowed through, the slight tug into a trance like state. She hesitated, fighting her initial reaction of jerking away from it and breaking herself out. She wanted to just pull away and say fuck it, to say they were fine and didn't need to work on this resonance. But the thought of how that would hurt Star, and wasn't the best tactical move, made her allow the trance to come over her. When she woke in a field of flowers, staring up at a starry sky, she looked around in...confusion. Confusion at where she was - where THEY were, because she could feel Star in the distance. Then confusion at why the hell she was wearing a dress - she hadn't worn a dress since she was a child. Then confusion at the fact that, despite having been pulled into some other dream scape like thing and knowing she should be frustrated at this, with how often it had happened at Black Diamond and Sapphire's hands, she didn't feel frustrated. She just felt...calm. She stood slowly, looking around and self-consciously smoothing the sundress down. Looking down at herself in a sundress was a little odd, but she ignored that to begin moving towards Star. If there was a path that didn't require her to trample flowers, she would take it, unsure what this dreamscape might imply and if she was somehow in Star's mind or something, she didn't want to be destructive here. "Star?" She called towards the auramancer, feeling the happiness coming from her which was...an odd thing to recognize and notice.
Star Lumina	As Ellesandra stood, the realm recognized their desire not to step on the flowers. So Ellesandra could watch as a dirt path just...Appeared where it hadn't been before, recognizing it wanted to go to Star, and thusly extended in their direction. It extending to be under Star's feet naturally had her look down and move along the path towards Ellesandra. It was a slow walk. The realm beyond extended infinitely. Just a plane of flowers, lazily rolling up and down as earth tended to do, but mostly flat. As the two walked towards one another, there began to form...Wispy lines of colours in the air. One such wispy line flowed on the breeze and passed through Ellesandra's chest. As it did, Star's voice rung out. "...I do keep asking you to trust me, but...I understand that that doubts I see in you will remain. I hope only that I can prove in time that I have aimed to be trustworthy at every step. You did save me, after all." It wasn't Star, the actual woman who was walking towards them speaking. It evoked a memory. A memory of near when Ellesandra and Star first met. Another one followed a minute or so later, passing through Ellesandra like the wind. "I know it sounds silly. But since we'll be here for the rest of the day...Let's come back here to look at the stars tonight, once the sun sets. See how beautiful it really is." - Yet another echoing set of words from the past, heard in Ellesandra's mind. Another followed shortly after, each one flowing freely on the winds and carrying with it the emotions Ellesandra felt at the time, but in a retrospective light. Inner reflection, rather than directly reliving the moment. "There. Consider yourself hired, then." These words came with a bag of coins dropping down on the dirt path in front of Ellesandra. THE bag of coins. A few pieces of platinum spilled out as it landed on the dirt at her feet. It then burst into motes of white light, vanishing. One last one passed through them, this one carrying a wave of desperation, of fear, of panic: "...Please, Ellesandra. Let me heal you." The shaky, frightened voice of Star echoed with her pains and fears that rivaled Ellesandra's own, fear that she would lose Ellesandra, that the knight would die when she was right there, able to heal them. Each of these memories carried echoes of what Ellesandra felt in the moment, be it their pain or fear or anguish or happiness or levity or whatever else...But they also carried echoes of what Star felt. Momentary glimpses into their shared time together, from both perspectives. The two were still a fair distance away from one another. Too far to talk. But Star's presence was still there. It still brought with it the overwhelming serenity that helped carry Ellesandra through these memories; even through the harder emotions, she was there, and her presence fought off the crippling damage that any painful echoes might try to do, just as she had fought off Ellesandra's nightmares.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra froze when the path suddenly just...appeared. That unsettled her, not knowing what the rules were for this place. Was it just an express your will type of dreamscape that she could change it? Was it Star's will that was changing it, in respect to the feelings and wishes she felt in Ellesandra? Either way, she'd begun walking towards Star, still hesitant and concerned about the setting they were in, even if there was an odd feeling of calm all throughout those concerns. The little wisps of emotion that went through her made her freeze at first, until she realized that it was...memories. Or was it just the emotional memories? She heard Star get frustrated at her not letting Star heal her, at her officially being 'hired', at the request to be trusted. Well, Star was trusted now - trusted enough that Ellesandra was sharing this with her, letting herself become potentially vulnerable with her in a way she hadn't let herself in a long time. Yet, there seemed to be at the same time an infinite distance between her and Star, causing Ellesandra to look around. Was there a...faster way there? If she just wished to be next to Star, would she suddenly be there? Ellesandra tried, hoping to skip any of the random emotional memories that...well, it wasn't that they were uncomfortable or bad at all, but more than Ellesandra was still uncomfortable with this type of vulnerability.
Star Lumina	The world around Ellesandra seemed to be at least partly under their control. They willed the path, it appeared. They wanted to be closer to Star? And suddenly, they were close. The desire was made manifest. The last few steps closed, and Ellesandra and Star were before one another. Star smiled at Ellesandra. Star's hair wasn't in its usual style here. It was in a twin braid, like Star had worn during that memory of her childhood that had been shared. The two braids of snow-white hair were cute, tied with pretty blue bows at the bottoms. And with the two of them standing close to one another, a faint white light shimmered over Star's heart, as well as over Ellesandra's. From these two white lights, a wispy line of mana extended between the two. A line that had always been there, clearly, but was only visible in this...State. This place. It was their connection. Their resonance. Star kept her eyes on Ellesandra. She rose up a hand, palm flat and facing Ellesandra, inviting them to mirror her and press their palm to hers. "...This is the moment we can strengthen our bond, Ellesandra. Touch my hand with yours...And open your heart. The stronger your desire...The more you can open yourself...The more you let me in...The stronger our resonance can become."
Ellesandra	She blinked, a little surprised that it worked when she suddenly appeared near Star. There was a moment of taking Star in, eyeing the two cute braids and bows, appreciation and attraction filling her for a moment before the attraction was pushed down again. The light between the two of them was also something that was inspected, Ellesandra reaching a hand up to touch it as if she could just pluck at the string between them like a musical chord. Only after attempting to do that did she look at Star's hand and mirror it, grumbling. "Open this open that, everything you ask me to open is something I don't like opening, Star." The grumble was one of resigned acceptance, though. She did try to open herself - try being the key word. She had no strong desire to open herself in this way, but she did desire to empower Star and make her stronger, more useful in helping Ellesandra in keeping her safe, and that desire was the main thing that was leading her to do this...if it counted for this desire at all. Oh, there was desire for Star too, a desire that was strong but well leashed and controlled, not being allowed to come up to the forefront, but she wasn't sure if that mattered in this dream state. Did her ability to hold her feelings back count at all right now, when they were being so open and vulnerable with one another?
Star Lumina	The white connection between their hearts responded like smoke when plucked. Affected by the motion, but it wasn't tangible. It also did remain in one, contiguous piece the whole time, but was sent slowly drifting along the direction Ellesandra plucked it before moving back into its resting place that, itself, was slowly shifting and fluid. Star giggled at the grumbles, but didn't say anything. Attempts to repress emotion were more or less moot. Everything felt more raw, controlled by waves of calm rather than inhibition and repression. The feelings didn't come with compulsion for action, but they also weren't able to be pushed down or minimized in this state. Ellesandra wasn't their whole self in this moment, though fragments of their whole self remained on them as a shell that was slowly eroding the longer they remained in this trance. Ellesandra was looking into themselves, seeing their most core emotions. Star was on careful control of the moment, to ensure that the torturous emotions of the looming mountain of grief were kept away. Calm. That was what had to be maintained for this to work. When their hands pressed together, Ellesandra felt the connection pulse. It was a familiar pulse. It was something that Ellesandra had felt when Star went off, ultimately leading to her aura 'breaking'. The connection was...Powerful. Power surged through Ellesandra, letting them feel Star's presence and mana melding with them. She closed her eyes. The empowering feeling was...Good. It felt good. Very good. Emboldening. Strengthening. Healing. Ellesandra was able to feel her own senses sharpen. Awareness of her surroundings became clearer. Her muscles felt tighter, more under her command. Her right arm's dull ache soothed - though not actual healing was transpiring. But the potential was clear. And then, a dull throb in Ellesandra's chest. Then another. Then a stronger one. Then, even stronger. A growing, powerful thud. A heartbeat. Star's heartbeat. Ellesandra's and Star's were out of sync initially. But with each beat, they grew closer to one another. More in sync. Until Ellesandra felt both hearts beating together, as one. When they were out of sync, it was mildly painful. The closer they came to being in sync, the less it hurt, until finally the synchronized beats felt...Good. Very good. And at this moment, the white line between their hearts began to glow. The emotional barriers between them were stripped away, and Star began to glow with her aura for Ellesandra to see clearly as her emotions blossomed through the connection. The happiness, calm, the desire, the affection, the concern, the fear of losing them, the want to be close, the safety she felt in their arms and at their side, the flood of anxious feelings reminiscent of a schoolgirl falling in love for the first time, though tempered with very much adult perspective that had much clearer, more sexual eventualities and fantasies that surely sprung from it. Emotions that evoked mental images of the two of them nude, bare bodies pressed together with hands roaming one another. But her desires were not entirely that - the desires she felt equally evoked sensations that brought to mind sitting together watching a sunset, or looking at the stars and simply being content with one another; feelings that evoked a sense of fighting side by side on the battlefield to protect each other and those they loved; of being by Ellesandra's bedside to nurse them back to health; of being there for Ellesandra, regardless of if she was a friend, a lover, a wife, or just an ally. Different permutations existed, but they all had in common a stalwart strength. Star was irrevocably bonded to Ellesandra in her mind and heart. And through that unwavering desire came a surge of potential, which pushed into Ellesandra's heart and tore through whatever barriers Ellesandra might try to put up before it and expose the core of Ellesandra's desires, stripped free of fears, of doubts, of repression and denial. The overwhelming calm kept any of this emotion from overflowing, of battering Ellesandra's mind or heart. It allowed her, in this moment, in this trance, to simply...Look into themselves and feel Star's open heart and be challenged with how much they accepted Star, and how much they could be vulnerable to her in turn if they lived in this perfect world of flowers and peace where nothing else mattered. The real-world complications still existed, far above in the conscious world. This would not change anything. It simply stripped away all that stood in the way to make each woman as vulnerable as possible to one another so their barest selves could experience each other and temper the chains of their bond to empower it to new heights.
Ellesandra	At first, Ellesandra was frustrated at her inability to control her emotions. But then all of that just seemed to...go away. She felt the calm slide in, felt the pulse from before and she glanced at Star, just to make sure she was okay and there wasn't a repeat of what happened before. And then the heartbeat. A soft wince was given as she felt it being off beat with her own, kind of like a soreness or pain in the chest, and her free hand came up to cover her chest in feeling that. As the hearts synchronized and began to beat as one, though, she looked back at Star. Felt her goodness, her positive influence, her calmness, and even without the influence of this realm on her, those feelings for Star began to burn brighter, stronger. They alone wouldn't have been enough to burn away the darkness, the fears and doubts surrounding them, but in the combination of Star's calmness, of seeing - no, feeling - Star's desire for her both as a lover and as a companion, she wanted that. She might deny it, might deny to herself that it was needed, but deep down, she did. The desire that was reflected back to Star, Ellesandra's own, was a bit different from Star's. While Star did have a focus on fantasizing about them together, Ellesandra's desire didn't really focus around that. Oh, she was physically attracted to Star, aroused by her and the idea of being intimate with her, but to Ellesandra that physical, lust focused idea wasn't new. It wasn't something that she focused on as a goal or desire with Star. What was, though, was the intimacy that came along with it. The brief flash Star might get of the idea Ellesandra had for them intimate was Star arching or in the throes of an orgasm, but then it was just...closeness. Being held by Star, just touching one another, feeling that protection and love no matter what. Feeling that Star would be by her side through anything. The emotional intimacy was what Ellesandra wasn't used to, and what she craved - even if she'd never verbalize that or admit it to herself. The idea of them sitting together every night under a field of stars, cuddling up. Maybe with a dog, potentially even a child. These were the desires she wouldn't admit to herself for Star - a life with her. Physical intimacy, sex - Ellesandra was numb to that, could get it with a lot of women, HAD gotten it with other women. But the emotional connection between them, that's what Ellesandra craved. She'd fucked plenty before, but she hadn't ever made love. Without the fears and the doubts, the self-hate swirling around these feelings and desires, they swelled, grew. They were obvious, any ability to block them not one that Ellesandra possessed. And she...didn't know what to do. The odd thing was, it was the first time she was truly letting herself feel them, too. Truly letting herself realize she desired not only just intimacy with Star, but a life with her. She was stunned, letting the combinations of their feelings swirl around them like that.
Star Lumina	The true realization of this bond, the acceptance of it - even if that acceptance would be contended by all the fears and doubts of reality once removed from the trance - was the source of power that this moment sought. That intimacy, that flowering affection, that solidarity, the essence of their bond. It was tapped into, bursting forth from Ellesandra's chest to meet Star's own acceptance of it that saw not a single point of resistance. Star had always accepted all that Ellesandra felt, of course, so it came as little surprise. But with it burgeoning out of Ellesandra, the resonance was tempered. The white line between them grew brighter than it had been, strengthening and empowering from their bond. And as it grew, so too did that sensation of power. In that moment, Ellesandra was made to feel invincible. Every good feeling, every hope, every source of determination within Ellesandra's heart flourished and blossomed anew, bringing with it the strength and conviction to face any foe, any challenge, any threat. There might not be a specific word that embodied their bond, but the sensation fit it. Whether it was closer to two lovers defending one another or two friends or comrades in arms or some combination of it or something entirely different, Ellesandra felt their place cement in Star's heart...And hers cement in Ellesandra's. Every desire to have Star by her side through anything was, in that moment, realized. Her heart called out, wordlessly, asking: 'will you always be with me, Star?', and Star's heart answered, equally in sensation without words: 'always, Ellesandra'. A firm reassurance of her unwavering conviction. And with that, the world around them faded to white, and Ellesandra woke up again. Normal feelings returned. The foray into their inner self had a great deal of focus on one particular part of themselves, so it might come with some measure of emotional whiplash when everything else came back. Reality was still real, after all. The influence of this meditative trance was no longer forcing the doubts and fears away from Ellesandra's heart, nor forcing away the grief and guilt they felt. Star, too, felt this snap back to reality. Her face was bright red, and she kept one hand holding onto Ellesandra's arm, though the other snapped to her own heart, clutching it as she panted. The connection between them allowed Ellesandra to feel that Star was fine. She was okay. Just momentarily overwhelmed, and now needing to process all of...That. Just the same as Ellesandra would need to. But in the wake of it all? A fragment of that invincible feeling remained. That connection with Star remained. Her aura, just her presence, had an empowering effect on Ellesandra, and the faintest, tiniest, most miniscule healing tingle could be felt in their right shoulder.
Ellesandra	The feeling of the bond strengthening, the bursting forth of their resonance...it was so strange. Yet, Ellesandra felt like it was right. Like doing this was the right thing to do, like connecting with Star was good. And then the feeling of being invincible overcame her. She wanted to run and fight Black Diamond right then and there. Of course, she didn't. She just felt good, for the first time in ages. If pressed to come up with the last time she'd felt this good, she wouldn't be able to give you a specific time it had been so long. The mixture of their desires, feeling Stars desire for her, her affection, cement in her heart, also made her heart skip a beat - if it could right now. A blush would move to her cheeks in the real world and she felt...nervous. Shy, even through the reassurance of Star's conviction. Their connection. And then the trance was broken, white light filling her sight before fading to being back in the room with Star. And then those doubts hit. Her heart, which had swelled with desire and affection as well as Star's returned affection, immediately ached for that same feeling. That assuredness, that knowledge that things would be okay together. Instead, it got the pain of fear. The realization that she'd shared way more than she'd expected would happen during this, that Stars face was bright red because she knew how much Ellesandra just wanted, needed, someone to just...be there. By her side. Holding her. And the self doubt hit. Ellesandra pulled her hand away from Star's remaining arm and moved backwards, both physically and emotionally retreating from Star again. Those barriers came back down, the words - 'You'll just hurt or kill her, Ellesandra' repeating in her mind. He moved to the other end of the bed and pressed herself down into the bed, head lowered and staring at her lap, with her hands wringing there. "Sorry I - uh. Sorry." What was she even sorry for? If pressed, she didn't know how to respond. She was just sorry for sharing something that she didn't feel like she could act on. That she was burdening Star with her emotions, her feelings, when all they would do is end up hurting or getting Star killed. Just like they had with Marigold.
Star Lumina	Star had worried the emotional whiplash would do this to Ellesandra, so she was quick to follow Ellesandra as they retreated, crawling on the bed to land a firm hand on their shoulder. She looked at them, sure, and firm. Sure, she was still blushing. But she was, more than that, determined. "No." A single word, but it was about as staunch and firm as the gentle aurmancer could muster. "I won't hear it. That was all...A beautiful moment," she said, tears welling in the corners of her eyes. "And I won't hear you apologize. I already told you...Nothing is going to change just because we feel something. It's what we do with those emotions that decides what path we walk. And I know that you're still scared. I'm not scared, Ellesandra. But...I know you are. So just take a moment...Breathe with me. Find your center again. I'm here for you." Star's hand on Ellesandra's shoulder evoked a...Stronger response than it previously could have. Their bond had deepened. And though it was but a quiet echo, there was a remnant of that invincible feeling. That reassurance echoing in Ellesandra's heart, that Star was being sincere. That she was going to be there. Ellesandra had accepted Star, and Star had accepted Ellesandra in kind. There was trust. There was belief. There was conviction in Star with this newfound, deeper bond. "It's okay, if you need to cry, or if you need to be held. I'm here. I'm right here."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra flinched when Star followed her and touched her arm. It wasn't a flinch from someone who expected Star to do them harm, but it was the flinch of someone who was afraid of Star getting too close, emotionally. Of the feelings she had right now hurting Star, remembering how Star had emotionally exploded the last time Ellesandra had shoved her feelings for the auramancer down. Star persisted though, and tried to reassure her. Her jaw muscles were clenched with the strength to bite through steel, it felt like, as she looked away from Star, not letting Star meet her eyes. She didn't cry, but even as Star soothed her with the touch, the little bit of reassurance there, a small hint at that invincibility in the touch, the negative emotions and darkness swirled. She took long, deep breaths, trying to center herself like Star said. To push them back down. Not to feel them, but to bundle them up and push them down where they'd risen from the whiplash. To bundle them around her emotional feelings for Star, and once again shroud them, trying to pretend they didn't exist. It was futile; at this point, those feelings and that desire burned bright enough to be seen even through the shadow, even if dimmer. But the attempt was still made to ignore it, to pretend it didn't exist so that she didn't have to live with those insecurities in her mind constantly. "I need to - to shower." She said. She hadn't showered earlier, letting Star do it, and normally she waited until morning to shower. But with the way today had gone? Maybe she needed another shower to help process some of it. She stood, as long as Star didn't stop her, and headed into the attached bathroom. She didn't bring new clothes, since she'd just changed into these ones and would just use them instead. And if Star didn't stop her, she'd keep the water right on the edge of too hot. The water wouldn't scald her or leave any permanent damage, but it was....uncomfortable.
Star Lumina	Star didn't stop them. She needed to let Ellesandra have the comfort that fit them, not the one she thought was best. Within reason, of course. Self destructive habits were still a sure-fire way to make for one angry auramancer. But as Ellesandra got up, she grasped their hand with hers. A momentary, parting squeeze. A gesture she'd done before, last time Ellesandra had used a shower to try and reset. "...Warm water," she said quietly. And if Ellesandra didn't listen and still produced the discomfort with the heat of the water, there would be a gentle knock on the door. She doubted she had to do more than knock to make it clear she knew what the knight was doing. Even if Ellesandra got mad at her for hounding them over it, she wasn't going to permit the knight to inflict this sort of torture upon themselves. She took a cold shower earlier, of course. She needed to, because otherwise she was gonna start interpreting a lot of what Ellesandra said in horny ways, but it was reasonable cold. Just cold. Not freezing. Not uncomfortable. Just a little chill to splash on her face and cool her off. What the knight was doing was beyond that, and she wasn't going to stand for it, if they still insisted on doing it.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra paused when Star told her to use warm water. She frowned, and there was no hiding that she had fully intended to make it uncomfortable on herself. But she didn't say anything when she headed into the shower, and the change was that the water was hot, but instead of being on the line of painful/uncomfortable, it was on the line of uncomfortable/normal. Just hotter than most people would do, but hopefully not hot enough to get Star upset at her. It didn't help, not nearly as much as the discomfort helped distract her from the swirling darkness inside, but the water was still cleansing nonetheless. She closed her eyes and let her head rest against the shower, water just rolling down her, and then she reached over to her right shoulder. The arm where she'd felt Star, intentionally or unintentionally, healing her just a little bit each time they got close. Between Stars emotional outburst and then that resonance just now, she wasn't sure how much had healed - but she could tell some had. And the idea of that disturbed her. On one hand, it made sense to get it healed, to be back to her full martial strength. Oh it wouldn't be full, she'd need to work her right arm up from it's physically weakened state now, but it would be a step in the right direction. On the other hand, there was a large part of Ellesandra who felt like she deserved to have that injury. Deserved to have that pain when she overused it. It was a reminder of how she got it, why she got it. It was a reminder of the day she'd seen Marigold be killed. A reminder of how she'd used Marigold's own rapier to stab the man who did it through the eye. A reminder of her mistakes. With a few deep breaths, trying to push those feelings back down, push down the distrust of Star healing her, push down the doubt still swirling, she came out of the shower dressed and with a towel wrapped around her head to take care of her hair. She glanced at Star briefly, but then turned her gaze away again. "I...I don't know if I can do that again." She said, keeping her gaze turned away while walking to the opposite bed from what Star was in, trying to create some distance.
Star Lumina	Star was mindful of the other woman's state in the shower, but she couldn't really be mad about just taking a normal hot shower. Just like she couldn't be made to feel bad for needing a normal cold shower. It had its therapeutic uses, as long as it wasn't hurting the person taking it, or edging too close. Water was soothing. Pain was self-abuse. So she settled on her bed, and elected to look at the journal that had been left on it. She hadn't started reading it by the time Ellesandra came back out, and was just examining it. When the knight emerged and professed they were having doubts, Star met them with a soft nod. "It's okay if you can't," she said, keeping her voice gentle. "But...Don't go deciding it on a whim. Please just trust me when I say emotions that strong need time to settle. Even for me. I'll need some time before I try that again myself, if we do. No firm decision either way just yet, okay?" she said with a smile. It was perhaps surprising that even Star herself was saying 'hey this emotional stuff might be too much for me', but it certainly ought to help Ellesandra feel more justified in how jarring it was for them. In truth, Star wasn't deterred, as she found the whole thing beautiful. But the problem was, then, that it was so beautiful to her that it dropped a powder keg onto her feelings for Ellesandra. And as much as she insisted she was okay even if Ellesandra never returned her feelings, that was only true if she didn't actually fall in love with them. If she just...Indulged these feelings with reckless abandon, it was possible she'd push too hard out of her own desire, pushing Ellesandra into an unhealthy emotional state that might fracture their bond. She needed to pause and assess before she could continue. She recalled how Ellesandra felt in that memory, standing next to Marigold. The nervousness. The dry throat. The way her heart ached. She was feeling her own version of that steadily blossoming in her heart. Their time in Myst had resulted in a lot of fanning of that fire. There was no telling what would happen once they were back on the road. Would their mission take too much focus, leaving their bond to wither and die? Or would crisis evoke the depths of it and set it ablaze? If only she could see the future..
Ellesandra	She hadn't expected Star to tell her it was okay if she couldn't. That had been...the last thing she'd expected. She glanced at Star out of the corner of her eye, but then back down. She listened to what Star said, but didn't respond. Her lack of response was an acceptance, in this situation though. It wasn't her saying 'no it won't happen again.' It was leaving it open to see, in the future. She moved to lay back down on the bed and then turned, atop the covers, with her back to Star and pulled her knees up. The self-comforting position she'd taken enough that Star would recognize it, her fetal position one in which she wanted to just hold herself. "We should go to bed. Early day tomorrow." She said this, but even just looking at her aura Star would be able to tell Ellesandra was going to have troubles sleeping that evening. It was a way to shut down the conversation though, to stop it and push Star into sleeping so that Ellesandra didn't have to worry about her hearing when she did end up crying. And she probably would, eventually.
Star Lumina	Star might feel the need to give Ellesandra distance to process things at their own pace. But it wasn't like her auramancy deactivated overnight, nor did her feelings for the woman vanish while the knight was in the shower. She paused for a moment before considering what she was going to ask, but did ask it. She wasn't going to back down from at least trying to fight Ellesandra's cold, distant tendencies, even if she couldn't force herself on them. "...I'd really like it if we slept in the same bed. If I could hold you tonight. Nothing but just...Cuddling. Promise. But I'm not sure if you feel it too but...Being separate after what we just did feels a little...Weird. Wrong...Achy...It'll help me sleep much better if we could." All of this was true. She hoped it would be helpful to Ellesandra too, of course. But she had certainly noticed that the knight was more likely to accept these things if it was about her than about them.
Ellesandra	Star was right on the money. If Star had phrased that in any way that would have been to help Ellesandra, it would have been flat out refused. Her phrasing it as needing it herself, though? Ellesandra didn't answer at first, debating with herself. There was part of her that did, indeed, want Star holding her. That part was being conflicted with the need for distance, to keep Star away. She busied herself by removing the towel from her hair and tossing it randomly near the bathroom, damp hair now resting down along her back as she continued to lie there. "Okay." She said, finally. She'd only agreed because she was afraid Star needed it because Ellesandra was pushing her away. A lie she told herself that she'd continue to do, even with Star holding her. Even if she knew that Star holding her would potentially make her break down faster, harder. She didn't know how to handle herself right now, though, and if Star holding her would make it better? Well, who was she to refuse something Star wanted to do to make herself feel better too?
Star Lumina	Star donned a soft smile and set the journal on the side table as she slowly eased out of her bed and over onto Ellesandra's. She carefully moved into the bed behind them, pulling the blanket over the pair of them as she moved to spoon them. She pulled them against her, her front to their back, and let her calming presence wash over them. Their bond was noticeably stronger. Her influence, that much stronger. Of course there was nothing she could do to stop Ellesandra from breaking down and crying if they needed it. But she was there. A calming, reassuring presence that whispered to Ellesandra's heart, saying everything was going to work out. Something that took the edge off the pain, even if it still needed to be felt. That, combined with the general comforts that physical touch provided, was all Star could do for the conscious knight. Truly, it did bring about an ease in the ache she felt in her heart, being able to hold Ellesandra. She firmly kept herself from indulging romantic thoughts in the moment. That was still...Off limits. But she could enjoy it, and be comforted by it, all the same. Sleep was very much needed - it hadn't been a lie that they had an early day the next day. But even as Star drifted off, she remained connected to Ellesandra. If they were crying, if they were tormented by their heart, she would wake again and pull them more flush against her while whispering sweet nothings to them to give what comforts she could. And assuming Ellesandra did at some point sleep, Star was the valiant bastion warding their heart against encroaching nightmares. She wouldn't allow that. She would not allow Ellesandra's mind to torment them, and her influence, unconscious as it was, would ensure that Ellesandra had positive dreams. Emotional ones? Maybe, maybe not. But good ones, all the same.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra, at first, just let Star hold her. She enjoyed the comfort it gave, even if she would never say that. Eventually, probably after Star had drifted off to sleep the first time, she'd begun crying. It wasn't loud, it wasn't sobbing. She didn't even jerk with crying motions or anything. There were just...tears. At the pain, the fear, the strength of it all combined with the absolute bliss and ideal feelings she'd had when in the trance. The recognition of what she truly, deep down, wanted. To be loved, to have a wife, a kid - a peaceful existence. All things she'd never let herself admit before, all things that seemed completely out of reach for her. Who would love someone like her, so guarded and so...broken? When those feelings had been held back, being able to recognize those desires, that need and want was easy. With those feelings here, it just felt like someone had waved a potential good life in front of her, and then slammed into place all of the reasons that it couldn't happen. Even if Star did wake up and from the silent tears, from the pain that Ellesandra felt at the realization, or belief, that those things couldn't happen for her, she just stayed there. She tucked her chin down to her chest as if to hide her tears, hide her face from Star, and continued. Eventually, she would literally cry herself to sleep. Star's presence there was the only reason her dreams did not go awry. They wanted to. Star might even feel it - or whatever presence or comfort that supported Ellesandra would at least. The tug to take a dream that had started with her spending a day with Marigold into Marigold getting split in two by an axe - not even how she died, but more gruesome and so her mind had summoned it as an hyperbole. Or how that dead Marigold would have changed into Star and Ellesandra would have been crying over a dead Star instead of Marigold. Those things just...didn't happen in the dream. The pleasant dream continued, maybe not a great happy dream but not a nightmare either. And like the last time Star had influenced her dreams this way, Ellesandra would wake in the morning feeling...a lot more refreshed than she normally did when sleeping.
Star Lumina	It was one place that Star certainly had strength enough to affect actual change on emotional matters. Dreams. Reflections of the unconscious mind. Of course, Star was no Sapphire or Black Diamond or magical reality-bending tarot card. She wasn't going to be able to stop any of that. But when nightmares came knocking, Star had her brief moment to shine and banish them. No gruesome sights. Just happier times. A reflection instead of the easier life Ellesandra longed for. A calm life. A peaceful one. That was something Ellesandra's mind could construct, fill in the details however it wished. Let them live that fantasy a while before waking up, properly refreshed. The waking world was painful enough, after all. Star had awoken when Ellesandra cried, soothed them as best she could before they cried themselves to sleep again. She naturally felt the emotional response, the feeling of loss, of grief in the face of what could be versus what was. A feeling that hit Star, too. Feeling Ellesandra's raw affection for her, it still echoed in her heart. The potential for them to be so emotionally intertwined. To be so fulfilled by each other. To not be able to have that...She could understand, certainly, that feeling of loss of what could be. But once more, she reminded herself. It would get worse, before it got better. She held hope that, even if she and Ellesandra did not become lovers, that she would see Ellesandra smiling, genuinely, and free from the thousands of tons of rubble that kept her heart so buried. For what ever could someone want more for someone they had romantic adoration for, than to see them happy? Even if not with them...Their happiness remained her desire. These things were all swirling in her mind as the knock at the door roused her from sleep. "Wake up sleepyheads, time to go!" said Amelia through the door. "Get your butts up and get food in you, we're burning daylight!"
Ellesandra	She woke up, having turned at some point in the night to embrace Star back. Her arms had slid around Star's waist and she'd buried her face into Star's chest, holding onto her as she'd dreamt. When she awoke to the sound of Amelia knocking on the door, she rose her head swiftly, checking for danger. It was a habit, to check real quick when woken by something. Nothing was around, but she was holding closely onto Star, cuddling much more intimately than she normally would have been in her waking world. She gingerly extracted herself from Star and slid to the side of the bed, only glancing at Star once to ensure she was up before moving to stand. "We're up Miss Young Whippersnapper. Get off our lawns." Ellesandra had slept better than she normally did, but that didn't get rid of the training she had to wake up quickly. She didn't even seem super drowsy as she moved to begin putting armor on and collecting all their gear, putting the card in a pocket directly on her rather than in their pack, and so forth. She tried not to look at Star, feeling...embarrassment at how she'd woken up, and some of the things she'd dreamt about. Things she was certain she'd never have, but the dream of living out a life with Star in some cottage surrounded by fields of flowers, a dog and two kids...it had been a nice dream. A dream she would never admit to having.
Star Lumina	A dream Star similarly would have no way of knowing that Ellesandra had. But good emotions through it were hers to unconsciously feel, so Star woke up feeling good. Albeit a bit red in the face for some reason, but she didn't comment, just smiled at Ellesandra and began getting ready herself. Morning rituals done swiftly, trying (and not really succeeding) to keep up with Ellesandra's pace. She gathered up all the books they had, which were clearly not as needed as they thought they would be coming into Myst, and set about changing into her magical outfit again. She might need it. "Uh huh, get right on that grandma, captain expects us out at the gate in thirty, so put your cane into overdrive, would'ya?" Amelia called back, followed by the sounds of receding footsteps. Amelia was waiting by the entrance to the guild hall. Food was quick; they were up early enough to beat the morning rush and be first in line, and swiftly able to get some food into them. The books were taken with Amelia to the service desk to be returned, something that was of vital importance in Myst, before the group was ready to head off. It would likely be a good reprieve for Ellesandra. No emotions. Just task after task after task, completing things in an efficient manner to get to their assigned objective. Star was able to keep up, though she very obviously was not used to the military life, and even something as simple as just eating swiftly to get on with it was not normal for her. She enjoyed savouring the small pleasures in life, after all. But unless Ellesandra had any specific detour or other business, they were heading straight for the gate. Nothing to be left behind. They could be gone from Myst for a long time, or they could be back the very same night. But until they knew, they had to prepare for the long haul, ultimately culminating in them departing from the main city of Myst to one of its many 'clock hands' that extended out into the cloudy abyss, whereupon they were faced with a large portal that Amelia had to set about attuning, a process which would take a short while. Long enough for them to be greeted by Amara, who was already there standing watch in wait for the others. It was barely past dawn, so for Amara to beat them here by this much, the captain must have risen before the sun was even cresting the horizon.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra went about their morning rituals with the efficiency and speed of someone used to packing up and being ready to leave quickly. She even stopped to help Star if she needed help with anything, though she was careful not to do so in a way that would imply Star was being too slow or holding them up or anything like that. Food was eaten and she gave Amelia a 'respect your elders' talk in an old granny tone while Star finished. Keeping up the comraderie, distracting herself from the emotional whirlstorm that was her once again realizing that her dream was just that - a dream, and not obtainable. Unlike the night before, she had something to do now though. That something being getting everything ready and leaving Myst. When they dropped the books off at the circulation desk, she was sure to thank Serenity if she was there. Other than that, she didn't head on any detours while going to the portal, and would nod respectfully to Amara, but as they waited for the portal to be attuned she would look over to Star. Her hand came out, gauntleted or not, and just lightly touched the side of Star's hand. Not holding hands, but a brief touch to show support. "You nervous?" This was the first time Star would be returning to her home plane since she was sent away. And she had confirmation that her mother had been captured. No one could know for certain what awaited them on the other side, but trouble was certainly going to be part of it. Not to mention they knew that Black Diamond was going to come for them sooner or later, whether that was right when they got there or later.
Star Lumina	Star gave a soft smile and a little half-shrug with her shoulder at the question. "A little. But not because I'm going home. More just the uncertainty of what's waiting for us. Trying to be optimistic," she said, shooting one more smile at her companion. She appreciated the little physical bump. That she responded well to physical affection was something Ellesandra had clearly come to understand at this point, and it made Star happy. She briefly adjusted her ponytail as Amelia finished what she was doing. The portal then activated, a swirling mass of mana that was ready to transport them. Some brief discussion followed with Star and Amelia fine-tuning the location. Their destination had been agreed to be nearby Hotenz city, which was apparently on the star plane of Gurhal. Their ultimate goal was the moon plane, but the intention was to establish themselves and get a place they could come back to if needed, some place safe that had lots of work to do if they needed. With it all done, the only thing left to do was step through it. Star paused at the portal, assuming Ellesandra and Amara were going to take the lead, though if Ellesandra let her, she preferred to hold onto Ellesandra's hand as they moved through it. And once they did, in whatever order, the group of four found themselves in the midst of a sunny, rolling, grassy plain. A large hill that rose up and created a plateau was visible to the north-east, with some forest to the south, and a large body of water to the north-west. The immediate moments after teleporting in were ones of calm. No immediate threats to be seen. But the good news didn't last long, for Star frowned as she looked around. Amelia, too, looked like something wasn't right. "This is...The sun plane," said Star. Amelia then added: "This isn't right. This isn't where the portal was attuned." Hearing that, Amara pulled her spear off her back. "You don't make mistakes like that, Amelia. Tell me you were just slacking off or something," said Amara, the caution clear in her voice. Amelia shook her head. "No, something interfered." And that something made itself clear, for the shadow-sense that Ellesandra had immediately spiked as not one, not two, but three sources of the shadow-essence came zipping towards them at lightning-speed. Two portals opened, one to the north-east, one to the north-west. Out of the north-east portal stepped the familiar suited man with green hair who had summoned the armor that tried to kill the group. Out of the north-west portal was a tall, scantily clad woman with short, black hair that wielded a scythe. And the third presence Ellesandra felt? It was behind, to the south, but there was no portal, and no actual person to be seen. Just a presence. An invisible one. Naturally, given what Star had revealed to Ellesandra, it would come as no surprise that she took a moment to lean over and whisper to Ellesandra. "There's a third one behind us. It has the same sort of aura. It's one of them," she said, though it would be something Ellesandra already knew. So it seemed that Star didn't really know about Ellesandra's shadow-sense. "All right, no jokes this time," said Blood Emerald. "You fucked up. Big time, Ellesandra. And before any of you do something stupid, we're calling a truce." There was a seriousness in the voice of the man who had been nothing but jokes the last he had been seen. "My associate Blood Onyx here," he said, gesturing to the other woman. "And I...Would prefer to not turn your first five seconds in Gurhal into a bloodbath, buuuut...That's up to you all. No. Getting straight to the point? The big boss has requested an audience with you, Ellesandra. In person. Alone."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had nodded at Star's words. They made sense, though she knew she herself would be nervous if she were returning 'home'. Then again, she had very different reasons to be nervous. When it came time to enter, Ellesandra had strongly considered holding Star while going through, just in case something happened while doing so, but she decided to go forward with Amara for the more likely danger of there being something waiting on the other side. This was accurate, if not an immediate thing right when they stepped through. The portal closed behind them and Ellesandra was looking around, curious at the strange landscape. This wasn't what she'd expected, but when it was confirmed that this wasn't Gurhal...Ellesandra immediately drew her Rapier. "Incoming." She'd said as soon as she felt the three shadows coming. She didn't need Star whispering to her that there was a third, but it was appreciated nonetheless. She positioned herself next to Star, in a position where she could keep an eye in the direction of the one behind them without making it obvious she knew they were there. As the Blood Emerald spoke though, she shook her head to him. "Tell Die they can go fuck off and visit me in my dreams like they were doing before we went to Myst, if they really want to talk to me. Or are they unable to do so in Gurhal as well? Not that that seems to be where we are." Ellesandra was in a defensive posture. She did not think they could take all three of these people with just them, even with Amara and Amelia's help. If the choices ended up being they fight or she went, she'd go. But she was going to offer at least for them to get the hell away and to talk to Black Diamond in her sleep, at least. That seemed a safer option for all of them, as well as a way for her to tell Blood Emerald no - which was more satisfying than she'd ever actually admit.
Star Lumina	The shadow-sense that Ellesandra had made the answer quite obvious. The gems where were their hearts should be. The third, invisible gemstone was one that resonated with the same energy that Black Diamond had introduced as Red Opal. Amara and Amelia took up defensive postures complimenting Ellesandra, putting Star pretty smack-dab in the middle. The three enemies had formed a triangular formation around them. A wide berth was between them. Of course, with the speed they arrived, it was unlikely running was an option. "This is Gurhal," corrected Amelia. "Just...Not the right part of it. Not where I was aiming," she said, though her words were curt and transactional. No attitude. Just passing information, fully in fight mode. "We're not going to argue with you, Ellesandra. If what was necessary was possible through existing channels, we wouldn't be here. You'll put your rapier away now and step into this portal or for every two minutes that pass that you haven't, I kill one of your friends," said Blood Onyx, speaking with a fierce authority that was...Vaguely reminiscent of how Sia might speak, if Sia was a murderous psychopath. Blood Emerald kept his arms folded after flicking one hand to the space between himself and Blood Onyx, which opened a portal for Ellesandra to walk through. "What's the play here, soldier?" asked Amara, clearly ready to fight if they called for it, suicidal as that might be. But she clearly didn't like the idea of just...Giving up the knight to the enemy. "Come along now, and nobody has to get hurt. We'll leave your friends alone as soon as you step through," said Blood Emerald. "And assuming you refrain from fucking up this badly in the future, you can rest assured this truce will be a one time affair, but a truce, is a truce."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra turned to look at Blood Onyx when she spoke. While there was an initial response of attraction Star might see in Ellesandra - a recognition that she looked nice and had the intimidating presence that definitely drew Ellesandra's eye, there was absolutely no intention behind it. It was a base attraction, the type of attraction you felt when you saw a pretty lady on the street, but nothing more - especially for one of Black Diamond's servants. She didn't really see an option, here. She considered requesting that Star be allowed to come with her, just so Ellesandra could more easily protect her directly, but not only did she think that would be unlikely, that would set a bad example with Amara and Amelia for leaving them behind. If she didn't trust them to take care of Star, then she was also admitting that them staying there was dangerous. She pursed her lips, looking between Blood Onyx and Emerald. The acceptance came after a moment, noticeable in her emotion as she steeled herself for what was going to come ahead. She sheathed her rapier, reaching out to touch Star's arm in an attempt to reassure her. "I'll keep my rapier on me. I suspect Die could flick me across half the plane with a wave of their hand anyways, not like a needle prick will do anything to them hmm?" It was a forced compromise. She looked to Amara and indicated behind her. "And there's one back there too, Captain. If they attack, aim for their hearts - nothing else will do anything." She stepped forward, out of formation, and began walking straight for the portal, intent to get this done. If this was her death - well, it'd be her death. And, she wanted to slap Die around a little before she died for threatening Star, and her newfound companions. If it wasn't? Well, the chances of them holding to a truce were just barely a little higher than any of them getting out alive after a fight with all three of them.
Star Lumina	There was no motion from the servants of Black Diamond as Ellesandra moved into the portal. Star had nodded, but it would not take auramancy to see how worried she was. When Ellesandra stepped through, they found themselves standing in...A classroom? The grand shadow themselves was sitting on top of one of the desks, feet on the wooden chair before it. There were obvious paths to walk between the desks, but with Ellesandra walking into the room from the rear and the portal closing behind them, the likely result was the knight keeping their distance and leaning on the wall or something. The classroom also had no ceiling. Instead of a sky, there was a rushing flurry of red dust flying past. No sound was made as it did. It also could be seen out the left-hand windows. There was a door to leave the classroom, but opening that just revealed more void with dust. The shadow remained in place, but then, perhaps surprisingly...The shadow melted away, revealing the person, the woman, beneath. The Black Diamond had traits that were obviously opposite of Sapphire. Red eyes, black hair. A sense of gothic lolita fashion, from the black getup complete with thigh high stockings to the heavy boots, she was certainly had her sex appeal. Black Diamond looked at Ellesandra. Her expression was fairly...Neutral. "...My name is Valentina. Though you're free to continue to call my whatever you please," she said, not particularly caring what Ellesandra did on that matter. "And I've called you here because, it seems...You've cursed yourself. Something I'm sure comes as a surprise to you, given your talent for...Redirection, and magical resilience."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra walked through the portal and just...looked around. She had a very tight reign on what emotions she was letting show. There was concern mostly for Star that was being held down, not letting herself focus on it. If she did, she might panic at the idea of them killing Star while she wasn't there. She took a moment to look around the room, seeing the shadowy figure on one of the desks, and after only a second of consideration she began walking directly towards the shadow. She didn't seem hostile, her hand not trailing near her rapier or anything at all. She walked right up to the desk, even as the shadow went away and Valentina showed herself. Ellesandra looked her up and down, raising an eyebrow. "I expected something a little more." She said, completely ignoring what Valentina had actually said. She gave a glance around the desks, then nodded. "Yeah, this one is nice. Excuse me." And she would sit down in the seat of the desk that Valentina was sitting on. If Valentina didn't move her feet, or stop Ellesandra from doing so, she'd just sit on her feet. Completely natural, stoic face, as if this was entirely normal when meeting an apparently really powerful being. She then looked up at Valentina, her face still void of the confusion Valentina's comment had wrought, or the concern she still had for Star. "So, cursed? I curse myself all the time, but I assume you mean a magical curse of some kind."
Star Lumina	Unfortunately, Ellesandra's final words wouldn't have the chance to be spoken, for the moment they tried to sit on the chair occupied by Valentina's feet, Ellesandra just...Fell through the floor. Like it didn't even exist. And began to fall. And fall. And fall through an unending void of red particles that passed right through them. The void was the same in all directions, until it all turned black. The clouds of red particles could be seen overhead as Ellesandra descended into a truly black, lightless void, falling for the better part of a minute before the destination of their fall came into view. A bed of adamantine spikes as infinite as the void. Certain death. Alone, with nobody who could even know where Ellesandra even was, Ellesandra fell onto the spikes, impaled in a dozen different places and, for a single moment, experienced the excruciating pain of this impalement and their rapidly encroaching death. And then, they were back in the classroom. Standing at the back, where they had entered. Valentina still sat on the desk, where she had been, looking rather...Unfazed about whatever just happened to Ellesandra. Was it real? An illusion? A trick? Ellesandra could inspect themselves to see there was no injuries upon them. But what did just happen to them very much felt real. The pain felt real. Their adrenaline was certainly still spiked to its absolute maximum from the event. Valentina just...Looked at them. "As I was saying. You're cursed."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra began falling, and at first she looked around, trying to find something to grab onto to slow or stop her fall. "Shit." She muttered to herself as she just...kept falling. There was a brief moment of regretting her action; she'd been calling Valentina out on her not wanting to kill Ellesandra, or she would have already done so. Well, seemed like she was going to do so now. The thing was, there wasn't...panic, or absolute fear in Ellesandra like there would be in your average, mentally sane person. There was concern for what would happen to Star, a little bit of regret that she'd done that and pushed the situation to one where she wouldn't be able to protect Star any more. But there was an...acceptance that she would die. This is where the darkness in her calmed her - an acceptance that she'd finally be released from the emotional turmoil inside of her. Star had been very right to be concerned about it, since in this moment it was proving that Ellesandra was fully willing and able to just accept her death. When she saw the spikes, the only thing she did was curl up so that fewer would hit her. There was no chance of not getting hit and dying, she knew this. But she could limit how skewered she was, in case Valentina threw her body back to Star, tried to torment or scar her with it. She could also try to insure death came quickly, and she didn't just bleed out on the spikes. The pain that went through her caused her to cry out and eyes close, clenching against what had been known to be coming, but even knowing didn't mean you could really prepare for it. She coughed up blood and then - suddenly, she was back in the classroom. Ellesandra blinked in confusion, looking around and patting at her body. No holes in the armor where the spikes went through. No pain, anymore anyways. She remembered the pain - that much pain didn't just go away, so even if she wasn't actively feeling the pain it still felt...tingly. Like her brain was expecting the pain, even if it wasn't there. Surprisingly there was...relief. She was still here, still able to help Star. That was the main reason there wasn't disappointment at still being alive. Taking a deep breath, she took a seat at one of the desks in the back. She'd learned her lesson; Valentina wouldn't be fucked with. "Yeah, well." Her voice came out raspier than it would have before. A little bit from the shock and scream of being impaled, though more psychological than physical since she wasn't sure her physical form had actually been hurt at all during that...vision or whatever. She considered telling Valentina that being stalked by her and her minions was a curse, but she held her tongue. No need to antagonize the woman more. "I might need some more details than that."
Star Lumina	Valentina gave a soft nod. "That's why you're here," she said, looking...Saddened. Not that she expected Ellesandra to have sympathy. But it did seem that even this evil woman wasn't immune to the emotion. "Have you ever.." she paused. "...Considered something, some...Punishment, perhaps...To be something you would not only not wish on your worst enemy, but something you would actively help them out of?"
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked...confused. She frowned, squinting her eyes at Valentina, then looking around as if looking for Ashton Kutcher and camera crews - not that she knew what any of that would mean. She just felt like she was being pranked somehow. "Yes, but as flattered as I am that you'd consider me your worst enemy, I don't know if I can truly claim that title. Sapphic might prefer it." A pause, then adding. "So what am I cursed with?"
Star Lumina	Valentina gently nodded to the answer. "You aren't my worst enemy, so don't feel the need to be flattered. Sapphire isn't, either. She's just my most powerful enemy." She then paused again to think on how to answer the question. "You're cursed with...The same thing I am cursed with. I don't know that it has a name. I wouldn't give it the affection of naming it. But recall what happened when you stole the mana from within that suit of armor. That brief flash you had into different lives...That was real. They were real. Real people, actively, at the time you saw them, suffering through what you saw. You didn't...Take over their bodies or anything. The curse just...Forced you to relive their experiences. And if left alone, it will do this to you again. And again. And again. Until it is constant. Until it never stops. And only ever gets worse. Until you are feeling...All of it. Everything everyone everywhere, in every plane of existence, all of their suffering. Never any of their joy, or happiness, or anything of the sort. Only their darkest moments. Only their deepest fears. Only every dark and broken and twisted part of humanity until you can no longer resist the urge to take your own life." She looked at Ellesandra, eyes steel with a firm seriousness. "And when you do, it won't let you. Trust me....I've tried every way you can imagine. But you don't deserve that. You don't deserve a lot of the things you've experienced...Being the maid of honour to the woman you love and standing there as they say 'I do' to someone else in particular hits pretty close to home for me. Can't say I expected someone else to have gone through that, and it was pretty shortly after it happened to me, too," she said, donning a sad grin and shaking her head. "Been a while since something rubbed the salt in my wounds that hard. Not that it was your fault, obviously. But if there is one exceptionally unique experience out there where I can say I know how it feels, well...That's it." She paused, collecting herself again. "...So. We can go back to business as usual after all this. Go back to...You making up really bad nicknames for me, being a general shithead, me trying very hard to persuade you and Star to stop what you're doing without actually killing you if I can help it...But that all takes a backseat when this curse is festering in you. So I need to remove it from you."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked...disturbed at what Valentina said. Did Valentina already know that, or was she some damn deity just watching Ellesandra and Star? Her arms crossed and she squeezed, resisting the temptation to be more of a shit head in rebellion to this super powerful being taking an interest in her life. "So, you a voyeur or something, watching my conversations with Star? And what do you mean cursed for seeing that? That was my own idiotic fault for trying to draw the magic of the armored knight into myself, the memories of whatever it had with it. Did that curse me, or are you saying that my magical...abilities are my curse? I am certainly no auramancer and what you're describing sounds like the negative bits of auramancy." She was confused still, not entirely sure what exactly the 'curse' was, and a little distracted by how much Valentina knew about her. She hated that, and the reminder of Marigold. And that damned Prince.
Star Lumina	Valentina shook her head. "I'd much rather butt out of everyone's business. But every time you suffer, be it a physical wound, be it emotional turmoil, which for you is fairly constant, it is felt by me, as well. I live the experience as if I was you. But I'm also simultaneously doing so for...Everyone who is suffering, all the time. It takes a backseat to my consciousness; the whole trance phase of it was only the first...two hours of it once it took me over. As for watching your conversations? No. In particular, whatever went on in Myst is.." She gently shrugged. "One of those places I couldn't spy on if I wanted to. And there's been times I wanted to, certainly. But no, the curse was in the mana. You took it from the armored knight. The curse...Stuck to you. It shouldn't have, by all accounts. Between your magical resistance and the general structure of it, it shouldn't have stuck to you. But it did. It's inside you now. Weak, below your notice more than likely. It would have not power while in Myst, as well. But if you ignore it, well. It will eventually consume you, as it has me. Magical empathy isn't unique to auramancers, though they are certainly the most adept at it, and being able to 'see' emotion is certainly unique to them. But if it simplifies it for you, sure. Think of it like if Star was only ever able to see one thing: Suffering, in whatever shape it took. Pain, rejection, fear, terror, disease, hunger...Pick your poison. Including literal poison. And then expand that to...Everyone. Every living person. That is what the curse is. The curse I thought I could fix but...Instead just got stuck with myself."
Ellesandra	She took this information in. And then she sighed and hung her head back off the back of the chair, staring up into the red swirling dust above that formed the 'ceiling' of this classroom. "Cool, that's a lovely little existence. Maybe I'd be a bitch too if I had to live with that forever and couldn't just off myself. How fucking lucky of me." She reached up, pressing the palm of her hand into her right eye and pressing in a little to fight off the stress headache that was forming. "So, the options to get rid of it? Since you said apparently the all powerful demon goddess of yourself couldn't fix it." Ellesandra was...tired. Exhausted. She didn't want this. The idea of not being able to end herself when feeling the suffering of every person in the world was...ugh. She had times where she actively wanted to end herself with just her own suffering, let alone feeling others. "I'm assuming this isn't something that a powerful cleric or paladin by the name of Amara could just wave her hand and fix no?" Or Star, she didn't know what kind of restoration spells Star might have other than cure wounds, but she was hesitant to let Star touch this curse with her auramancy anyways.
Star Lumina	Valentina gave a sad smile at Ellesandra's words. "I'm not a demon. Just a girl who was born with the gift of being...Really, really good at breaking curses, and had a mentor who helped foster that gift. A girl who believed in healing people. A girl who was subsequently killed for healing the wrong person, so said some fatass king. A girl who should have just died in the snow that day, but was saved by an angel. Then fell in love with that angel. And let that love make her...Try to fix the curse that angel had. Suck it right out of her necklace into another necklace I made, then destroy it. Only, well..." She paused. A small flash of red mana appeared around her neck. The necklace in question summoned into existence. The chain was black as night, jagged and frayed. Attached to the jagged metal were spikes, all pointing inwards towards Valentina's neck. The ring of spikes were spaced about an inch apart, and were all of different lengths such that the points of the jagged, blackened metal spikes all terminated about two inches away from Valentina's neck; looking at it, it seemed as though if one tried to take the necklace off over top of her head, the spikes would drive into her neck. The pendant for the necklace was, perhaps unsurprisingly, a gem equally as black as night inlaid into a blood-crimson setting. It reeked of vile, hateful magic, such that any magical senses Ellesandra had would feel active fear from its presence. "It's one of two curses I've never been able to break. And to be clear I can't break it on you, either. But I can take it back. Remove it from you, and merge it back into this necklace, where it should stay. And trust me...If Amara or Star or...Anyone in the whole multiverse was able to fix it...I'd be first in line. But as my luck would have it, the person who has the greatest knowledge and ability to fix it is...Me. I've looked, for over a thousand years now."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked back down at Valentina, eyeing the necklace, then tilting her head. An angel, huh? She pressed her lips together to consider if commenting on that was smart, and ultimately decided not to do so. "If the curse is in that necklace, you said you just brought it on yourself when pulling it from this angel. I'm assuming you, or I, wouldn't be able to just pull the curse from that necklace to another necklace then? When I was pulling magic from the armored knight I wasn't trying to redirect it, I was trying to fuel my own magic, but I don't think I've ever run into magic that I wasn't able to redirect." Even if it effected her for the time it would take her to redirect it - which did not sound like it would be fun. Still, Ellesandra doubted that would work anyways. Surely someone who seemed to be as old and powerful as Valentina would have tried something similar before; it sounded like that is exactly what she'd tried with this angel love of hers. She shook her head. "Sorry, I've got to assume you've tried something like that, not trying to womansplain-why am I apologizing to you? You just tortured me with spikes." A huff, crossing her arms. The idea of having this curse was not one she wanted, and if Valentina was offering to take it back, Ellesandra would take that. But there was part of her mind, at the very back, that knew...Star would be offering to help Valentina, if she could. If she had the ability Ellesandra had, to redirect magic and to draw it in on herself, to actually affect the flow of mana within a curse...she wouldn't just let Valentina take the curse back and then leave, even if Valentina was trying to kill her. Her teeth clenched and she waited on Valentina's answer, trying to hate the woman while at the same time truly considering if there was a way to help her.
Star Lumina	"You're right. I did that. So it's better you stop thinking about if you can help me. I don't deserve your mercy or sympathy or apologies." She paused again. "The angel was Sapphire, if you were curious. I still remember brushing her hair and calming her nerves the day I walked her down the aisle. A little different than how it was for you I think. Hurt about the same, though..." She shook her head. "Sorry. I keep getting distracted. Your ability to redirect the magic might pull the curse out, but then what? I did the same thing. It just latched onto me. There's no...Destroying it. There's no stopping it from latching onto someone. And the reason I opened with my question about punishment you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, well...You're not even that, so I'd sooner banish you to Avernus than put this curse on you. It'll feel like a vacation by contrast." Another momentary pause. "So just...All I really need you to do is relax for a while. Let me do what I need to do. Then I'll send you back to your friends. They're unharmed, as promised. Then you can get back to hating me, and everything will be right back as it should."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched the woman for a few moments. A plan was forming in her mind, but she wasn't confident it would work. And the risk of it - well. It was a hell of a risk, considering the consequences if her idea failed. She relaxed her posture, arms out on the desk and closed her eyes. Deep breaths, trying to center herself like Star had shown her during the trance. There were the shadows, the negative feelings, telling her she'd deserve the consequences either way. That she deserved to be punished, and this would be one way to ensure she could live the punishment of her sins. Another part of her once again told her that it was the right thing to do. Yet fear existed, fear of it not working and, well, her living with this curse forever. After another few moments, she opened her eyes and looked at Valentina. "I have an alternative offer for you. I take that curse - either successfully put it into another object, or just take it upon myself, either way. And in return, you release Star's mother to her, with a promise not to hurt either of them, my companions, or have anyone else do so either. You'll protect them instead, like your life depends on it. In exchange for no longer having to deal with this curse, at all." It was a pretty good deal for Valentina, Ellesandra thought. At least, unless there was some other underlying reason that Valentina had captured Aurora and was keeping her and Star separate.
Star Lumina	Valentina slowly closed her eyes. She drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. "You're not a very good listener, Ellesandra," was all she had to say in response to that offer.
Ellesandra	She waved a hand. "yeah and? you're martyring yourself. Either give me the necklace, or let me pull from it, either might work. I'm not saying I'll be able to fix it, but I'm willing to take these risks on here." She placed her elbows down on the table, leaning over and looking at Valentina. "Or, do you want to keep suffering? Do you feel like it's a distraction, other people's suffering, from your own? That you deserve it for the things you've done?" Ellesandra spoke from...experience. "This is an option to get rid of all of that pain, Valentina. Are you telling me that you would rather keep that, and then still hunt down Star and keep Aurora away, than let someone else feel it?"
Star Lumina	Valentina's response was immediate: "I would rather kill every living being in the entire multiverse than put this curse on someone else. And I say those words as someone who desperately wishes she was still that young girl who helped others. I never want to kill another person. But I've fallen so far from those ideals that I'm beyond sympathy. Don't think me a martyr; that's what you're trying to make of yourself. I'm sure you'll understand these words when I say that if someone must suffer this pain...It's better that it is me. At the very least...In due time, my suffering will mean something. The only life left for me after the things I've done is death."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra shook her head. "Sure, I might martyr myself, but I'm getting something out of it. And, well." She shrugged. "Maybe I have a plan for it. But this isn't about sympathy, Valentina, at least not mine. Maybe after I take it you spend a day or two talking to Aurora and Star. Sounds like you need some emotional therapy from an auramancer yourself." Ellesandra was only about five percent confident her plan would work to prevent her from living in suffering for the rest of eternity. That five percent though, was enough to give her confidence it was worth it to ensure Star's safety. To ensure she got her mother back, and also enough to ensure she would be protected, in the case that Ellesandra wouldn't be able to later. "You don't have to take the offer, if you want to just take the curse back I won't stop you. But the offer is there, and I would rather you take it and stop hunting Star than to have to kill you later anyways." That last bit wasn't something she actually thought she could do. It was meant as a joke, a recognition that they'd be enemies again and she'd probably die anyways, curse or no curse. Yet, it made it clear the path they were choosing here. Valentina could give the curse up, and protect Star - or she could keep the curse, keep the suffering, and probably end up killing Ellesandra in a few days, weeks, months, whatever.
Star Lumina	"You'll never want Star or Aurora to every lay eyes on me, since you're so protective of them. It will kill them just to look at me. Not physically, no. But they'd see the depths of this curse, and if it didn't just put them into a coma, it'd make them immediately reach for the nearest blade and off themselves. It's what I tried to do the moment the curse set into me. Trust me," she said with a huff. "Sapphire has tried more than enough, and she's among the most powerful angels in the multiverse. Seems like adequate emotional therapy to me, when we're not trying to kill each other. I admit I'm surprised at your offer, self-sacrificing as it is. I can't tell if it's something you're offering because of the depths of your hatred for yourself, or the depths of your love for Star, romantic or not. Maybe it's just both." She gently shrugged. "But you're dealing with energies and complexities that are so far beyond your capacity to deal with that whatever confidence you have that you could do something tangible about this curse is deluded, fueled only by your disregard for your own life. Not that I don't understand that, too. But if you'd like to take your shot at killing me here, you're welcome to try. Really, if your only concern is for Star and Aurora, that's your better shot. I'll stand here, no weapon, no fighting back, no dodging, nothing. Just standing here. You do everything you can to kill me. If you succeed, I get release of death. All my thralls die. There'll be contingency that Aurora is freed and teleported right to Star. Worst case, maybe it lets you get out some frustrations on me."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra considered that. In reality, her reasons were a combination of her hatred for herself and her affection towards Star. And, well, it was her duty to get Star's mission finished. This was one way to do it. She didn't actually think she'd be able to kill Valentina at all, but it didn't mean she wouldn't try to just end it quickly, right? She stood from the desk, drawing her rapier, and taking a moment to consider the woman in front of her. Her eyes fell to the necklace indicated, then back up to her face. And then she made a few arcane symbols with her right hand, converting her physical energy into a mana that allowed her to cast spells on herself. The light blue glow appeared around her, the magical defense stronger than she'd cast it previously. She repeated the process, letting the blue glow settle over her rapier as well, empowering it to the full extent her magic would allow her to. At this state, it would be able to pierce through the most sturdy of armors, though the drain on her was about as much as the Haste spell was when she was pushing this much energy into the spell. It wasn't intended to keep up during a whole fight, but to place in for a single blow. Ellesandra took a few steps towards Valentina, weaving around desks as necessary, until she was within striking distance. She took up a fighting stance...and then stabbed towards the gemstone with the point of her rapier. It would be too much to actually expect the rapier to be able to cut through it, like it did with the gem in the pirate captain. Ellesandra was trying, but that hadn't been her true goal either. Whether or not she was able to successfully pierce the gemstone, if Valentina hadn't moved from the strike, it meant that her magic was in contact with it via her rapier. And she immediately attempted to used that point of contact to draw upon the mana within the stone. She wasn't drawing it into herself - which is what she'd done with the armored knight - but instead she was drawing it directly into the magic within the blade, the spell which was being used to sharpen it, make it stronger. An attempt to use the mana within the powerful curse to destroy itself, essentially. It was risky, and she was playing with fire, she knew. She wasn't attempting to draw the curse within her, so technically she wasn't going against the whole not doing that. But she was drawing the curse into her magic, into her own mana, and that certainly came with the risk of it effecting her. That was why she'd empowered her magical shield, to hopefully reduce the potential impact of that happening, but who was she kidding? This was a powerful enough curse to bring someone as strong as Valentina down; let alone a peon like herself. Still, the attempt was made to destroy the gem, fuck the consequences, even utilizing it's own magic to empower her piercing attack - which continued to apply pressure unless anything else happened to stop her.
Star Lumina	Valentina stood off the desk when Ellesandra drew their rapier. She stood facing them. A magical pulse left her, and all the chairs and desks flew to the side of the room. Violently. Enough to crunch them all into piles of splinters that just lined the walls of the classroom now. Ellesandra was of course unharmed by this, the median line from which all the furniture jettisoned was in line with her and Valentina's dueling line. As promised, Valentina stood in place. She didn't move, nor dodge, nor try to stop Ellesandra from hurting her. When they instead tried to strike the gemstone, the reaction was...fairly immediate. The moment the rapier touched the tip of the gemstone and tried to siphon any of the magic into itself? The whole blade just erupted into splinters of metal that shot out in all directions. Valentina's reaction was to put up a magical shield between the blade and Ellesandra, so they didn't get hot splinters of metal in their eyes or something. No such magic protected Valentina, however, causing small red-hot fragments of what was once Ellesandra's rapier to embed in her arms, legs, torso, and one in her cheek, which did start to bleed. She seemed...Undisturbed by this. She then looked at the tiny stub of metal attached to the hilt of Ellesandra's rapier that was once a blade. Then back up to Ellesandra, looking them in the eye, and had but two words to say: "You missed."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra...blinked. She stared at where her rapier had just been...destroyed. "Huh." Came out, mostly in shock than anything. She had expected a million different ways in which Valentina would just flick her across the room or stop her or something. Absolutely destroying her weapon had NOT been what she'd expected. She held the useless hilt in her hand now and raised it up, looking at it, then glanced at her sheath. Couldn't really use that anymore now, huh? She seemed a little more put out at the loss of her weapon than she would have if she herself had been stabbed instead. After a moment, she took the hilt and pulled her pack off her back, slipping it inside, before straightening back up. "Point made. Lets get this over with and back to hating eachother then, hmm?" Can't say she didn't try, at least. She'd keep in mind potential ways to fix it later, but right now, she really didn't have much of an option here. And she'd just lost her main weapon, which was really not ideal considering they were in a potentially dangerous land once she got back to Star and the group. A knife, which was all she had left, wasn't exactly going to be great to go up against the Blood Emerald with.
Star Lumina	Valentina shared Ellesandra's sentiments generally surmised by 'huh'. She hadn't even done anything. She just never imagined anyone would hear how powerful this curse was and then try to suction it into a sword so haphazardly. Maybe if it was slowly infused it might have been able to handle more, but that was too much force and too much power all at once, clearly. Valentina then just looked at Ellesandra, the fatigue and weight on her shoulders clear from the look in her eyes. "I don't hate you, Ellesandra," was all she had to say before offering her hand for Ellesandra to take so she could do what she needed to.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra just huffed at the response. She hadn't had time to draw more of the gem's mana into the blade, considering she was pretty sure if she took her time to do so Valentina WOULD slap her across the room. Or throw her on spikes again. Whatever. With Valentina offering her hand out, Ellesandra rolled her eyes. "Oh you're giving me your hand in marriage? How sweet, I must decline though. You're not quite my type, all dark and broody." She did reach out though, taking Valentina's hand for her to do whatever it was she needed. Ellesandra closed her eyes, taking a deep breath and trying to prepare herself for whatever it was. She was expecting more memories like what she'd gotten when she'd first pulled the curse into her, apparently. When she'd felt the suffering of multiple other people, and how emotionally raw she'd been afterwards, breaking down there. That had come as a surprise then - now, she was going to try to prepare herself for that onslaught if at all possible.
Star Lumina	Valentina remained flat-faced as Ellesandra took her hand. She didn't seem much in the mood for jokes. Something about all of this seemed to be deeply painful for her. There wasn't really any way to contrast her expressions against past ones, however, given her previous veil of shadows. She said nothing as their hands were joined. And then, there was a comfortable...White. Consciousness slipped away. And though it wasn't Valentina's intention, her magic and interaction with the curse did evoke a memory. A period of time in her life, that Ellesandra would live out through her eyes. Not in possession of her, but experiencing it precisely how Valentina had experienced it all those many years ago. Periods of passage of time would skip over, and many of the more mundane hours and details became lost in the memory, skipped over as the vision shifted from one scene to the next. Ellesandra would not feel Valentina's emotions as their own during, but...Valentina's thoughts and memories were theirs to relive while Valentina performed what she needed to. Days, months, years of Valentina's life were condensed into what was just about two hours of Valentina needing to do what she must to remove the curse from Ellesandra, but Ellesandra would be blissfully in another world while it was all happening, seeing a past Valentina would have very much preferred to keep buried. When all was done...Ellesandra would wake again, feeling not so different from before, a bit refreshed physically if anything, and would feel their mind entirely having been shielded from any adverse effects of this shared memory, none of the intense emotions that might have otherwise associated with this sort of sharing of memory, with a firm boundary over what were Ellesandra's own thoughts and experiences, and Valentina's. Far, far more divided than Ellesandra had ever been able to experience thus far; such was the consequence of it being controlled by a master of magic, of course. Any reflections on the scene, and how Ellesandra might feel about it all, remained entirely their own to decide. And with it done, Valentina looked...Drained. Pale in the face. Sweating. And slowly collapsed away from Ellesandra, falling onto her back. Still conscious, with eyes barely opened, but...A process that clearly took a great deal out of her.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had expected random images of being abused, of pain and suffering like she'd seen before. She had not expected to see straight into Valentina's past. She was vastly uncomfortable with this, considering this was in all likelihood not a consensual sharing of these memories. She watched as Valentina met Sapphire, fell in love, how Sapphire had disappeared, how Valentina searched for her. And then how Valentina brought the curse upon herself, and the years afterwards. Ellesandra's heart ached for her, but through it all she just watched. She didn't pass judgment, didn't say anything, just let the visions go from one to another, over and over again. As she came out of it, what was apparently only two hours later but felt like an eternity in the memories, she blinked, looking around. She looked over to Valentina who was...falling. Ellesandra reacted by instinct, reaching out and taking hold of her arm as she fell. She didn't stop the fall entirely, but at the very least slowed it so that she was gently lowered to the floor. Ellesandra didn't speak, letting go of her hand afterwards and then standing awkwardly over the woman. The thought crossed her mind, that now would be a perfect time to try to do something against the gem. But after those visions, she was pretty certain she couldn't She crossed her arms, watching Valentina quietly. She wasn't so much as looking at Valentina with pity, than she was looking at Valentina in...disappointment. "Well. I'm going to pretend I didn't see any of that, because I'm sure you were not intending to show that to me. So, Valentina, what is next?" Straight to the point. Valentina was at almost deific levels of power herself, at least compared to Ellesandra. Just because she was winded didn't mean she wasn't still strong, and Ellesandra wasn't going to just sit around and wait for her to rest.
Star Lumina	Valentina gently shrugged one shoulder from her place on the ground. "It doesn't matter what you've seen. I don't care," she said, weak. "What's next is...You leave, I suppose. Not much left for you here. Probably should get yourself a new...w-weapon.." she said, teetering on the edge of consciousness. The portal opened up again where Ellesandra walked in. It would take them right back to where they had been before entering, once stepped through.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked down at Valentina for a few moments, seeing her on the edge of the consciousness. There was a moment where she considered if she could do anything for her, but then she shook her head. Even if she could, Valentina was still a horrible person now. She may have been a good person in those memories, in the past, but now? She was causing the same suffering she was feeling. Ellesandra remembered Lisanna, what those pirates would have done to her if Star hadn't intervened. Under Valentina's control, in one way or another. She turned towards the portal. "Till we meet again, Vallie." And she'd step through the portal, immediately looking around to see if she could find her companions, and ensure that Star was safe.
Star Lumina	Valentina said nothing, once more. She let Ellesandra leave. And when they did, they would find the trio of Amara, Amelia, and Star standing in the grass as they had been. No enemies around. Star was...Sobbing. On her knees, face in her hands. Amelia was kneeling beside Star, rubbing her back and trying to comfort them. Amara was standing stalwart, on watch, arms crossed. The moment Ellesandra walked back out, however, Star's face snapped up. She was shaking. Trembling. She'd been crying for a while, it seemed. At least an hour, maybe two. The red, puffiness in her eyes was a clear sign. She shot up to her feet and sprinted at Ellesandra as they stepped out, the portal closing behind them, and threw herself at the knight. "ELLESANDRA!!!" she cried, wailing, and breaking into quite an inconsolable series of new sobs. The immediate connection made clear it was no longer sorrow she was feeling; the sorrow was melting away from her. It was now just...Relief. Overwhelming relief that had her breaking down into tears, even before their allies.
Ellesandra	That...was not what she'd been expecting. She stared at Star as she shouted her name, then braced herself as she felt Star clinging to her. The woman throwing herself at Ellesandra had made one foot step back to balance while she caught her, the look of absolute bewilderment on her face moving from looking at Star, then over her shoulder at Amara and Amelia. "I'm fine Star, shh...It's okay." She said, wrapping her arms around Star tightly and squeezing. She kept her eyes on Amara and Amelia though, mouthing a 'What the fuck happened?' to them. Even still, trying to figure out if Star was just sobbing because of her being concerned for Ellesandra or if something else happened, she was trying to offer comfort to her. Her arms had stayed connected around her, holding her, until one hand came up to lightly pat on the back of her head. Awkward with her armor, and she didn't pet Star really because she didn't want her armor to catch any of Star's hair and pull it. But she was trying to send a reassurance to Star that she was safe, well, and probably even better than she'd been when she'd stepped into the portal. When she'd left, Star hadn't seemed quite so concerned or panicked, so surely they had done something while she was gone, hadn't they?
Star Lumina	Amelia and Amara just looked at each other and gave unhelpful shrugs and sympathetic gazes at the situation, suggesting the cause wasn't too clear. They hadn't been attacked, clearly. No blood, no sign of fatigue or anything else. It took a moment for Star to calm herself, but she was getting there, slowly. Once she had gotten composed enough to speak, she held onto Ellesandra's shoulders and pulled back to look at them in the eyes. Anguish was writ on her face. "I-I felt you die," she said quietly, arms shaking. She was feeling emotionally unstable in the moment, so much that her relief nearly translated to an action she...Wouldn't regret, actually, but was probably inappropriate. She would prefer her first kiss be one that was made in a happy moment, despite how much this moment of feeling like she'd nearly lost Ellesandra made her want to throw it all to the wind and make their affections for each other real. Of course, emotionally, that just translated to...Relief. Affection. General need to squeeze Ellesandra so hard they popped. Maybe a little possessiveness and fear and anxiety to throw into the mix. Of course...Ellesandra didn't die. They were fine. But it certainly gave a glimpse of the pain it would inflict upon Star if Ellesandra ever did actually die. Just the surface of it, for the worst of it passed when Ellesandra was away.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra blinked, looking down to Star. "You felt me...Die?" There was at first confusion, and then there was a clicking in her mind. She probably had, in a way, when she had been thrown onto adamantine spikes. Fuck. Immediate regret at her crassness towards Valentina that had caused that punishment, which had hurt like a mother fucker but also probably hurt Star, emotionally, way more. "I'm very much alive, Star." He reached to take Star's hand and then moved it to her neck, where she would be able to feel Ellesandra's pulse steady beneath her fingers. Normally she would have put the hand on her chest but - well. Armor. "I promise, the worst she did to me was cause a little pain because I was a little shit to her. Couldn't help it, you see an all powerful like being telling you what to do, you gotta just annoy them a little right?" She said this with an attempted smile, but the regret at what she'd done was obvious. Not regret at the punishment she'd actually received, but regret at how Star had apparently felt it. Ellesandra hadn't even considered this. It was also possible this had come from something near the end, when Valentina was pulling the curse from her, but that just...didn't seem as likely. It felt much more likely that being impaled by adamantine spikes was what set Star off, after all. Ellesandra didn't let go of Star, just keeping her arm around her while looking up to Amelia and Amara. "Any chance we can, I don't know, get out of here to wherever we were meant to be going now? I'll tell you all what happened then when I'm not concerned about overhearing cursed goddesses feeling Star's suffering right now." Well, that was probably a confusing as fuck phrase for all three of them, but they'd understand more when she explained later. As an after thought, she added. "And I need to find a place to get a new weapon. The bitch blew mine up."
Star Lumina	"Well. This adventure's off to a smooth fuckin' start, ain't it?" asked Amelia as she stood up again, said with a deep, heavy sigh. A huge weight was coming off her shoulders. Star closed her eyes when her hand was moved to Ellesandra's neck. Star concentrated on Ellesandra's heart. And in that moment, Ellesandra felt a tiny, tiny echo of Star's heart through their resonant connection. Her racing heart slowly calmed in Ellesandra's presence, feeling their heart. A physical reminder that Ellesandra was okay. It was helpful. Star gently nodded, biting her lower lip as she forcibly calmed herself. Her tears were drying, but a few sniffles and hiccup-y sobs still leaked out. Her hands were still trembling enormously. She'd need a while before she was truly calm again. "I-I...I didn't even know I could feel that...I couldn't feel anything else while you were gone. There was nothing and then just...A jolt. Just...Pain...All over." A shaky exhale followed, then she nodded, trying to smile. Not really succeeding, but...Trying. Amara looked around them. "We might benefit from Star having a moment to collect herself, then being able to guide us. Either that or...If Amelia could get us back to Myst, we could try to use the portal to jump back here but, more on target. Though if our enemies interfered with our arrival once, there's a good chance they could do so again. It might be wise not to rely on portals."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra gave Amelia a wry grin. "What, do most of your adventures not start with three powerful generals of a goddess level magic user show up, whisk one of your companions away, and then make it feel like they killed her?" Humor was the only thing she could think to try to remove the tension and the sadness from Star's eyes. Obviously reassurance that she was, indeed, alive would help but - well. She didn't know what else. So she squeezed Star again and would turn to look down at her. The obvious description of when she'd felt that pain all over was...definitely the spikes. Even more regret filled her now. She would have been MUCH more careful with how she did things - and would need to in the future as well - if Star could feel that. As Amara confirmed that portals probably weren't a good idea - even if she wasn't entirely sure they'd be bothered by Valentina right then - Ellesandra nodded. A moment was taken to sense for any of the shadows nearby. Assuming there weren't any, she'd slide out of Star's hold just long enough to reach down and begin undoing the straps of her breastplate. If the goal was to get Star to calm down enough that she was in a decent headspace to navigate them, then the fastest way to do so would be closer connection. Disregarding any warnings from Amara, if there were any, about removing her armor in a strange land with strange dangers, she'd remove her breastplate and all of her arm guards then pull Star back into a hug - tighter this time, and pulling her head down to tuck it against Ellesandra's chest so she could hear the heart beat directly. "We'll be fine for a while I think." She added, considering how tired Valentina had been. She wasn't sure if the power of her generals were related to her at all, but still. "I left her laying on the ground weak and looking pretty broken when I came back."
Star Lumina	Amelia shrugged. "It's about sixty-forty for that to happen," she fired back with a mutually wry grin. There were indeed no shadows nearby. An all-clear was felt. Nobody in present company knew what the hell Ellesandra was doing getting out of their armor, but equally nobody said anything. Amelia almost accused the knight of having lost their mind while they were away, but bit her tongue. Star understood rather quickly, however, and blushed as she was pulled against the knight. There was a...Surge of romantic feelings at that. Star obviously wasn't acting on them, but...Yes, if the plan was to get Star to feel calm, flooding her with positive emotions was a good way to do it. Not that hugging her was always going to fix everything, but...A hug certainly was unlikely to be the wrong choice in a lot of scenarios, even in the times it might achieve a lot less than it did here. Star hugged the knight back, naturally, and buried her head against their shoulder. Amara seemed...Touched for a moment. It was a cute sight, without a doubt. Amara seemed quite happy for the two of them, where as Amelia just kinda...Donned a frown, crossed her arms, and looked away with her usual bout of attitude. Who knows what she was thinking. It didn't matter, of course, because Star managed to find her center after a short while and separated from Ellesandra. She sniffled and wiped at her eye, still shaking visibly, but also visibly more...Okay. "U-Uhm...Probably a bad time to mention I uh...D-Don't actually know my way around the sun or star planes, huh? Mom never let me travel beyond the moon plane. But, uhm. I think I can feel a passage to a nearby settlement. That is...Some trails of emotion that should lead to people, at least."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra didn't really care what Amara or Amelia thought of this. She knew how Star worked, at least generally enough. She needed physical comfort, it would help with almost every emotional issue Star encountered. Obviously it wouldn't work for all but - hugging through armor wouldn't really do it when Star had thought she'd died, now would it? Since there hadn't been any real threat about them right then, she'd seen no issue to provide that comfort. Once Star pulled away, even if she was obviously still shaken and teary, Ellesandra began putting her armor back on without a single comment as to why it was necessary to remove it. She glanced over to Star at her explanation, then back to the other two. "Well, up to you if you want to do that or try going back to Myst. I can't guarantee they won't intercept another portal, but considering they haven't just come down on us right now and killed us now that I'm back and the truce is technically over, I don't see why they would go about doing that. We're just as likely to have them attack us here as we are for them to redirect our portal anywhere." Ellesandra honestly had no preference either way. She just wanted to ensure that Star was feeling better, that they were safe, and they could start their search for Star's mother. And that she get another damn weapon. She was still irritated that hers exploded, though she wasn't entirely sure if Valentina had caused it to explode or if she'd just put too much strain on the metal. It'd been a magical rapier already, so she'd thought it could handle it, but it appeared she might have been wrong.
Star Lumina	"If that's your assessment, perhaps it best we go back to the guild hall and get you a new weapon. You'll be a lot more effective with one, though I suspect you have a mean left hook all the same," said Amara with a brief smile. Encouraging of her allies, as always, even if she didn't expect Ellesandra to actually fistfight. Amara had a shortsword at her hip if it was really needed, which would be marginally better than Ellesandra's dagger. "We can requisition it as an operational expense, since if anyone asks I can say you're aiding the guild. Probably best not to push that angle, but a new weapon should fly under the radar well enough. And it's not a lie that you do need one, so." Amara had sway in the guild of course, though there were limits. "Hey, does that mean if I get tired of my whip and want a shiny new one I just have to break mine?" asked Amelia with her usual sass. Amara rolled her eyes and flicked Amelia on the forehead. Amelia flinched and rubbed the spot she was flicked, scowling playfully. "A little less attitude and a little more portal," commanded Amara with a grin, nudging with her head at Ellesandra and Star to join them. It wouldn't be long before the portal opened back up and they were taking one step forward, one step right back to Myst. Ultimately, it was just a walk back through the now mildly familiar place to the same guild armory that Ellesandra had seen before, except this time they were able to take a look at the weapons with more intention. There were rapiers, of course. Magical ones, of likely superior craftsmanship to what Ellesandra had previously. Ones that would even more easily receive the magic that Ellesandra imbued in them, as they were intentionally designed to be used by magic-users of all sorts. While there were certainly even more superior ones that were not within Ellesandra's realm to take, these would still be an upgrade. Among the choices were ones that were imbued with elemental magics. Fire, ice, and lightning, specifically. Each did a slight bit extra magical damage with each strike. Of course...If Ellesandra did want to peruse the other wares, there were spears, halberds, swords, mauls, bows...Just about anything Ellesandra could want, even if they were only going to be taking a single one with them, maybe two if the other was a shield. A shield that they wouldn't be able to effectively use with their right arm injury, but, only Star really knew about that.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra frowned a little at the idea of just taking one of the guild's weapons, but she didn't say anything. Star would see that she wasn't entirely comfortable with that idea, but she also wasn't going to argue with it right now. At the very least, she would be planning to return it when their combined mission was over, or she found another weapon that she could call hers rather than the guild's. And at the command to go back to Myst anyways, she did another check in with Star. She didn't want Star feeling like they were going to be ignoring her potential to lead them to a civilization, or that they didn't value it at all. The entire time, beyond when she was putting her armor back on or taking it off, at least some part of her had been touching Star. Holding her side, a hand on her arm, anything like that. A constant, gentle touch to remind her that she was fine. When they got back down to the guild and were looking at weapons, Ellesandra did take an extra bit of time to figure out which weapon would be ideal. Her eyes skated over the spears, and her right fingers trailed over one or two, but she didn't choose one of them. With her arm injured, and her left arm being out of practice with them, it wouldn't be ideal. Instead, she found herself looking at one of the rapier's offered, choosing the rapier that had ice elemental magic in it. She held it in her hand and ran her finger along the edge, then pulled back and tested a few strikes to ensure the balance worked well. After this, she turned to look at Amara, raising it. "Are you sure it's okay if I use this? I'll be sure to not let this one break, and return it when we're done."
Star Lumina	The rapier tingled with ice magic. Its balance was exceptional, feeling like an extension of Ellesandra's arm. It was light, but that didn't come at a compromise to its sturdy construction. It would prove to be both lighter, and stronger than the previous rapier. Which was saying something, given Ellesandra's previous weapon hadn't just been some mundane, common blade. Amara gently rolled her eyes. "Nobody is going to miss it. There'll be a dozen more of those made before you ever have a need to return it. Weapons break. It happens. Why do you think the guild makes sure to have so many backups? If you feel the need to settle things, then pay back the guild by ensuring Amelia and I can do what we need to do. And if you spy any particularly nice books in our travels, letting us take them back here will mean a lot more to the Followers of Myst than a surely well-used blade ever will."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra sighed, shaking her head and then moving to test it in her current sheath, to see if it would work there or if she'd need to get a new sheath too. "Considering I broke my last one because I tried to stab a magical gemstone with enough power to bring a deity to their knees, perhaps telling me they won't miss it is a good idea." She said, mostly making fun of herself at what had happened. She felt bad at the loss of her weapon, but also not feeling comfortable taking Amara's charity. Well, the guilds charity, either way. Sure it would be useful for the guild too, in her travelling with Amara and Amelia. She nodded at the comment about letting them take a book, though she felt like that was more Star's decision than hers. Star might not own the plane or everything on it, but she still felt odd just taking things from her homeplane and delivering them to Myst. "Anything else we need to do for this, then?"
Star Lumina	The rapier of course had its own accompanying sheath. While rapiers did have fairly standard construction, the one Ellesandra now wielded was subtly wider at the base. It wouldn't neatly fit in the existing one, and thus the old one was likely fine to either discard or store with the other broken blade if Ellesandra was particularly sentimental about it. The others around Ellesandra still didn't know exactly what the knight was on about, having not been there, but there was an assumption that the whole story would be revealed in time. Star was looking noticeably better; the combination of regular touching and reassurance and some time had done enough to get her at least calm enough to stop shaking. The red marks on her face were still pretty obvious though. Amara shook her head. "All yours, Ellesandra. We'll be sure to help you kill many a baddie with it. But before we go losing another day to this detour, let's get back to the portal, yes?" If that was all, then that would be just what the group would do, with a stop for food as it had been a few hours at that point and a brief lunch to get them re-centered would be better than road rations. All said and done, it was a routine repeat of the last time they were at the portal. And when they went through the portal again, they arrived...Right back where they had been before going to Myst. "DAMN IT ALL!" shouted Amelia when she realized that they were, again, not where she aimed to be.
Ellesandra	She would get the new sheath, taking the old one and finding a place to discard it and her hilt that she'd put in her pack before. During lunch, she sat next to Ellesandra and shared fruits with her, a silent thing while eating and doing any small chat but otherwise staying silent throughout the meal. She seemed to be pretty quiet overall, thinking about how to explain everything that happened. When they got back to the portal and went through, only to end up in the same spot, she paused and looked around. Then at Amelia. She considered commenting on it, but she decided not to. Amelia seemed like the person to take that personally. Instead, she would look towards Star. "Well, lets go with where you were seeing things then. Not an entirely useless diversion, considering I got a weapon again out of it."
Star Lumina	Star felt for Amelia. The magi was clearly accustomed to her magic going to plan. She looked at Ellesandra with a smile and gently nodded once, glad that things worked out. Truly, if they had not befriended these two, Ellesandra might be confined to just their dagger until they could find a suitable replacement weapon, and then buy it, and it likely would have been far worse than what the woman now wielded. But nobody needed to explain to Star that making friends along the way when adventuring was always a good idea, for she'd do it even if it just meant experiencing the beauty of friendship. The connections and ability to look out for one another certainly wasn't a bad thing, of course, but Star had always been an idealist with such things for reasons that took total of five seconds of consideration to understand. So began their journey, properly this time, into Gurhal. There wasn't much talk to be had along the way with everyone keeping an eye out. The landscape and its features were certainly so closely similar to other places that one could be forgiven for thinking they hadn't gone anywhere at all - grassy hills and trees were about the same wherever one went, though there would doubtlessly be differences if one looked close enough. One thing that might come to be noticed was the climate - the ambient heat was greater than their previous adventures, here. Not enough to be sweltering, of course. But it was more balmy. Pleasant, during what was indeed the autumn months. But one could imagine if they had arrived a few months earlier how oppressive this heat might be, then. There were some clouds on this day, but they were sparse. The air was on the dry side. An arid heat, rather than a humid one. A perfect day to enjoy the beach, if they were just civilians enjoying life. This nice day carried the group forward to the small settlement that Star had felt. Only about a half an hour of walking until they were at the border of the settlement. It was a small one. Some wooden houses, what could be identified as a small church, a building on approach that sported a wooden sign that had...A script that Ellesandra would be entirely unable to read, though it certainly had the look of a tavern, and a stone well could be seen in the middle of the settlement. Some people were visible. Some stood around, talking. One was leaving the settlement on horseback, and steered his steed a bit more to one side of the road to make room for the group approaching and gave a nod if eyes met. A group of four children could be seen chasing one another playfully in what looked to be a simple game of tag, with three avoiding one until they managed to touch another, who then became the one everyone was running from. The smell of freshly baked bread was lingering in the air, able to be traced to a bakery. But one thing that Ellesandra would certainly notice about all of these people was that they were not human, not elves, not dwarves...All of them sported fluffy ears and bushy tails of various colourings and patterns. Vertical slit pupils, along with sharp, pronounced fangs accompanying the regular set of teeth. Based on the tail, a safe guess was fox, though they were certainly a breed apart from the two fluffy-eared companions from Myst. More pronounced vulpine features, though this cosmetic difference did little to distract from just how normal it all was. Just people living their lives in peace. On the far side, to the left from their approach, of the settlement could be seen a field of wheat, and a pen of what looked like cattle, though they weren't cows. They had grey, patternless skin, plump and fat bodies, and stood a little lower to the ground. Or maybe they were just that fat. It was hard to get a look at them from this far away. The group of adventurers would certainly attract eyes if they moved into the settlement, though Star was, as usual, keeping behind Ellesandra to lead the way, as that was where she was safest.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra began looking around as soon as they'd begun walking. She was both keeping an eye out for anything of danger and any feeling of the shadows, as well as trying to remember where they were going and getting an idea of the landscape. If they needed to head back this way at all, she would want to have at least a little bit of an opportunity to remember what directions they had taken. When they got to the small town though, Ellesandra quickly eyed the fox like people, then looked at Amara and Amelia. It was a comparison look, seeing what similarities and differences there might be between the two types of animal-like species, or if they were the same. The fact that the man on horseback had nodded to them indicated they were probably a pretty friendly group, especially with seeing kids running around playing outside. Star would be able to notice a bit of a pang of...something in Ellesandra when she looked at the kids. A combination of longing and acceptance that she'd never have that. Ellesandra didn't show this at all though, and in fact didn't even watch the kids for any real amount of time other than sweeping her eyes past when looking for danger. She observed the different buildings and then turned to glance at Star, indicating her head towards the one that looked like a tavern. "I can't read that writing, is that a tavern we can stop in, get some information on our location and directions, and plan our next steps from?" That was ideal, since they didn't really know where in Gurhal they were other than that it was the sun plane. Star had said she wasn't very familiar with this plane, so getting help and directions would probably be ideal. "And we probably should have asked this before, but do the people from this plane speak Common, Star?"
Star Lumina	Star had noticed the longing in Ellesandra. It was a common desire. Star herself held it dear to her heart. To be a mother someday. To have such happy, smiling children. To break her fate and give her child a happy life. Not something that was looking particularly likely in her immediate future, given the people who were practically getting in line to mess with her life. Her thoughts were stopped in their tracks when Ellesandra asked their questions, however. She looked at the sign, then at her companions. "Oh. Uhm.." A blush rose upon her cheeks. She hadn't considered this. "...Some do, certainly. But, e-eheh...N-Not...Not everyone. It's not uncommon for people to only speak Gurhalian." She gave a soft smile and rubbed at the back of her head. Amara and Amelia looked at each other. Amelia then huffed. "Well. So much for going off on our own, if that's the case. Fat lot we'll get done if we have to communicate with vague gestures at everyone." Star kept her nervous smile about her. "Uh. But, yeah. That's a tavern. The sign says 'The Dapper Distova'. Which you'd uh, you'd get is a joke, if you lived here, because distova are...really ugly, gross farm animals."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra hummed in acknowledgement, glancing around and then over at the farm animals she'd been able to see at the comment of ugly, gross farm animals. Were those Distova? Not important, though, so she looked back over to Amelia. "Didn't by chance prepare any magical understanding spells did you? Comprehend languages and tongues, I think is what my magic tutor called them. But if not - then I think you're probably stuck with us." She intentionally changed her tone in that last sentence to come off as disgusted, like them sticking together was a horrible idea, but there was a tug of a smirk at her mouth. She was teasing Amelia. "Either way, Star," She said, turning her attention over to Star. Her hand lightly touched the small of Star's back and gently guided her forward to the front of the group, lingering for a second before then pulling away. "As you are the native and can speak the language, perhaps it would be best if you took charge here. I'll be right behind you in case anything happens." She said this reassuringly, considering what had happened with the group of shadows. Despite this looking like a completely polite town, Ellesandra wasn't about to let her guard down anytime soon.
Star Lumina	Amelia huffed. "Yeah, yeah, I don't have comprehend languages ready today, but that'll be the first thing I prepare tomorrow," she said, giving a cross of her arms as she shot a playful grin at Ellesandra. Star, however, seemed to be inspired by this line of speaking. She was ushered to the front of the group, but then immediately turned to face Ellesandra. "Ellesandra! Take my hand!" she said, offering both her hands despite saying to take just one. Over-eagerness, excitement, was certainly written on her face. A little sparkle in her eyes. She had an idea, clearly. "I wanna try something. Won't be exhausting myself with this, promise."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra smirked at Amelia, but then looked at Star in surprise at her sudden excitement and request. She had both of her hands out and Ellesandra looked down to them, then back up to her. The confirmation that she wouldn't be exhausting herself was more of a salve to Ellesandra's concerns than Star might have expected, but Ellesandra didn't immediately reach out. Instead, her head tilted to the side and a playful smile, one that she'd given to Amelia before - and one that Star had seen in her most recent memory when she was playfully insulting those at the table with her, slid over her. "Star." She said, in a very mock-serious tone. "If you're scared and need to hold my hand to feel safe, you can just ask, okay?" And with those words, she reached out and placed her right, gauntleted hand in Star's held out hands.
Star Lumina	Star donned a playful grin at the mock-serious tone and words. "Mmmm, I like hugs more for that, but I won't complain," she fired back, with a flash of attraction in her eyes. High spirits, and while she wasn't going to push the issue, there was still that fire in her. She didn't shove her emotions down, like some people who will remain nameless. Her attraction for Ellesandra still burned, and whether Ellesandra particularly noticed it or not before, it would become clear once their hands joined that the flame of her romantic affections had been fanned significantly since it was felt last. Which was...Just the previous night. It was also, at this point, rather difficult to ignore the shared emotions when touching. At least this time, Ellesandra would have nothing but good feelings to see in Star. Happiness. A feeling of safety. The aforementioned romantic affection. Of course, there were smaller, insignificant emotions that were darker. Things that lingered in the back corner of Star's heart she had yet to get over, but such things would always be there in some form or another. Little anxieties, small worries. It was all drowned out by her just being in good spirits, which did wonders to drown out the very real echoes of pain and anxiety she felt over having thought Ellesandra had died. That was still there, but...That wound had healed. It just needed time, now, and maybe a bit more comfort before it left her for good. The anxieties, the pain, gave way to greater depths of affection. But none of that was the focus in the moment. That was just the side effect of touching. No, what Star was so giddy about, was actually testing their newfound resonance for her auramancy. The actual manipulation of aura to allow her to affect the other. A ripple of magic flowed from Star to Ellesandra. Magic flowed into Ellesandra, melding with them, and curiously being entirely unaffected by Ellesandra's natural absorption and resistance. Just as with Star's sympathetic healing, this method of magic, her auramancy, was unimpeded and flowed freely and naturally through the knight. The effect of the magic? A sudden spark of comprehension. The sign was suddenly readable, even if Ellesandra didn't functionally understand how to read it still. But they could look at the sign and read it, understand it, as if it was in common, even as the glyphs still remained entirely Gurhalian. As well, whenever it came time for others to speak Gurhalian, Ellesandra would be able to understand the speech as well. A minor magic, and truly, it didn't seem to have any effect on Star.
Ellesandra	There had been affection in her teasing, even if it wasn't as much as Ellesandra actually had for Star. Those feelings were still 'locked up', in a cage with bars wide enough for Ellesandra herself to step through. The attempt to hide them, to lock them up, was still there. The actuality of it? Those feelings were growing large enough that they were demanding to be felt, to be noticed. Even Ellesandra couldn't push them down entirely. And when she touched Star and felt the affection in return, how much stronger they were now from last night, her own feelings sparked in response. They flamed up, as if demanding for Star to be able to feel them too, and Ellesandra swallowed in a what felt like a loud gulp. She pushed at them down, but it wasn't very effective. And then the magic rippled through. Ellesandra had tried not to focus on feeling any of Star's emotions, but with their connection that was just...not really possible anymore. So she felt the anxiety, the pain still further down at her own mistake that lead to her 'death', and then how much the affection just covered all of that. She'd gone from smirking and a little affection to Star to...silent, after the spell was cast. Unsure how to react to Star's emotions, the discomfort with having felt them - and not feeling like she could truly return the affection she felt. The feeling like Star deserved so much better than her, especially considering how she'd hurt Star already so much today. Those dark thoughts circled around, teeth clenched as they swelled up in her chest. The feeling of never being able to have a kid like before rising to the surface as well since it had already been actively there, but now the thoughts of Star deserving better, of Ellesandra being broken and emotionally unavailable, of not being able to be a good partner, of never actually being a 'partner' to someone versus just a sex buddy and the nerves that went with thinking she'd be bad at that, all of this was the response to feeling how strong Star's affection for her had gotten. And she knew that Star felt that in her. Knew that it could be taken as a rejection, and knew that that might hurt her too. Which lead to more guilt. It was a dangerous spiral, and Ellesandra took a deep breath to try to pull herself out of it, glancing up at the sign. She was quiet for a minute, before asking - "Can I speak this too, or just understand it?" She wanted to confirm if she heard someone speaking Gurhalian she didn't just walk up and respond in common like a typical rude tourist. She was also trying to focus Star on what they were doing, instead of everything she could surely see happening in Ellesandra right now.
Star Lumina	There was an unspoken dissonance between Star and Ellesandra on the matter of children. While Ellesandra might very reasonably believe that Ellesandra and Star wouldn't be able to have children together, Star certainly knew that it was possible, somehow, given how she was conceived. Again, somehow. A question that had been burning in the back of her mind for a long while now that she was a grown adult, something she hoped to be able to ask her mother about, awkward as it might be. Or maybe Ellesandra didn't even think about that, maybe they never got that far into thinking about it, and just believed they weren't going to be able to get to make that decision in the first place. She couldn't know. She just knew that there was a longing about it all. Star tried to offer her mystic comforts on it all while she could, about that, about what Ellesandra perceived as their own missteps. She gave them a smile. A smile that said she wasn't upset with them, at least. A smile that said they could talk about it later. She obviously wasn't going to get into all of that in the middle of the dirt road with their companions waiting on them. "Speak common and other people will understand you. You won't know how to speak it per se but...It'll get the job done. It should last until we sleep tonight, so just something to do each morning while we're here. Unless you want me to start giving you Gurhalian lessons on the road," she said, throwing up another playfully sweet smile, trying to keep the atmosphere happy. There was a time to talk about those more emotional matters she could see going around in Ellesandra. This was not it.
Ellesandra	The reassurance she felt from Star didn't really help much, but it was noted and felt. It was something acknowledged, even if it didn't make Ellesandra feel any better about herself than she already did. She nodded at what Star said, taking a few moments to look around and recenter herself away from those dark thoughts. She glanced back at Amelia and after a moment, said "Haha I can speak Gurhalian and you can't", actively trying to make sure she spoke in a Gurhalian rather than Common. She didn't know if that would work, or if the magic would automatically make it common or understandable of some form to Amelia, but she too tried to lighten the mood with humor either way. With that being said, she stepped past Star to begin towards the Tavern. Her hand lightly brushed Star's shoulder, a reassurance that she was fine. The kind of fine where there was a fire around you and you were accepting it, but either way. She'd step into the Tavern first, taking a moment to look around and ensure there was no obvious danger here, before walking towards whatever would look like a bar or a bartender.
Star Lumina	The magic didn't really work like Ellesandra's joke hoped it did. Ellesandra spoke common and Amelia understood common, so there was no magic to be done. It was when speaking to someone who didn't understand common that it would kick in. Amelia just folded her arms again. "No you can't, grandma, we need you to hold off on going senile for a while, okay?" fired back Amelia, earning a shake of the head from Amara as she looked between them. Star was giggling sweetly. She was obviously happy that these two wound up playfully going at one another like this than actually having friction. The brush on Star's shoulder was met with another soft smile as the group entered. The tavern was well-lit by motes of orange light that clung to the corners of the room, flooding the interior with a sunlight-like brightness that complimented the natural light pouring in from the windows. No dark, broody corners here. There were a few patrons, namely a group of three fox-people sharing some laughs and stories, something about how someone named Nilo failed a teleport spell and got half-melded into a tree for an hour, and hasn't been able to shake the nickname 'woody' since then, as well as what looked to be a couple. A man and woman just relaxing together and drinking the hours away, enjoying the peaceful life. The bartender was a spunky looking girl, a bit on the younger side but mature enough to be working a bar. A long brown apron covered her front over top of a white blouse. Bright orange hair was tied up in a ponytail, and matching orange fur crawled up the back of her fuzzy ears, with some white fluff on the interior. "[Gurhalian] Sun blesses you," said the bartender, chipper and sweet as could be to the group. "Not from around these parts, are 'ya? But 'ya look thirsty all the same, and we've got plenty of cold ale!" Naturally, Amelia and Amara were just standing awkwardly as these words spoken in another language just went without understanding.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had just rolled her eyes to Amelia, and when inside was looking around. She listened to the group make fun of their friend nicknamed Woody, and the idea was a little amusing to her. Still, she made her way up to the bartender and watched as the woman spoke, obviously speaking something other than common based on how her lips were moving but Ellesandra heard it as common nonetheless. This type of magic was odd; she'd never had it cast on her before considering the limitations of magic on her. Her luck, it would have been something like she understood it but it translated it wrong, or she could only understand half of what was said or something. After realizing she was meant to respond, not just appreciate her ability to understand, she cleared her throat and responded. "No, we're new here. Was hoping you might be able to help us with some directions - appears we ended up here on the sun plane when we were shooting for the Star plane, or even the Moon plane eventually, but ended up here instead. You don't happen to have any indication of how we can skip over to the Star plane instead, do you?" Like always, Ellesandra was straight to the point. She didn't think it was a good idea to drink ale right now anyways, and they had just finished lunch in Myst, though they probably should offer something as compensation for information if the young woman in front of her was able to provide it.
Star Lumina	The bartender blinked once, their bushy orange and white-tipped tail flicking behind them a few times. She put a hand on her hip, tilting her head to the side. A friendly smile still stuck on her face. "[Gurhalian] Well now, to miss your destination that hard is worth a medal on it's own," she said with a bright giggle. "I kid, I kid. Sorry to hear you're a bit out of the way. Lemme see here, Kaza had a map somewhere's..." she said, then lowered to look around behind the bar. She then rose up again and raised a finger, gesturing to give her a moment as she walked to a door behind the bar and disappeared behind it. She could still be heard: "Kaza! Where'd'ya put the dang map?!" she said, answered by an older man's voice coming from farther away: "Ey? Whassat, Ricca? Oh! The map, uh, check by the...Gah, blast it, the, you know, the.." "You mean the trunk?" "Aye, yeah, yeah, the trunk, I meant to stuff it in there." Some moments of shuffling. Then, footsteps came back. Ricca returned with a scroll case, popping the top off to pull out a map. She set the scroll case down and then unrolled the map along the bartop, turning it so that north was in the upwards direction for the group. Amelia and Amara naturally took great interest in looking at this, and Star had taken to translating the important parts for Amelia and Amara to hear in common while Ellesandra did the talking. The map of Gurhal that was displayed was on the largest possible scale. It showed the land masses of Gurhal, as well as major bodies of water. Intersecting the land masses were three lines, splitting the whole of it into three vaguely equal thirds, each marked with a glyph. Star, in the northern third. Moon, in the south-western third. Sun, in the south-eastern' third. The sun plane seemed to take a bit more space than the other two. About forty percent, with the other two planes roughly thirty percent of the total land share. The distance they'd have to travel based on this map was...Extreme. Made worse by how Ricca pointed to the south-eastern coastal landmass. "We're down here, village of Neet. This is the country of Serdio. King Laho presides over these lands. If'n you're trying to get to the other planes, you got quite a walk ahead of ya. Enough that I'd say adventuring folk like yourselves probably wanna find a way to teleport there. But I wouldn't know anythin' about that. You might head over to the church and see Father Copia, he might know where you could get access to something like that."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded, listening as the woman called for someone in the back to help find the map. She hadn't commented on missing the mark, and in fact was glad that Amelia couldn't hear because she was pretty sure that would have upset Amelia a little, even if she didn't show it. Instead she glanced down at the map that was placed, moving to the side to allow Amara, Star, and Amelia to lean over it to look. She only took a glance to get an idea of where the Star and Moon planes were, and then at where the woman had pointed to. Yep, that looked like it was going to be a helluva trek. Valentina had done a number on their journey, hadn't she? A glance was given to Star, just to see if she was looking particularly upset by this, but looked back over to the bartender after. "Thank you very much for pointing this out. We might speak with this...Father Copia to discuss options. Humor me for a second though, based on the scale of this map, if we were to try to to walk all the way to the Star area, we'd be talking...How long? Two, three months?" She hadn't actually examined the map to see what the scale was or how long it might actually take, but was throwing two or three months out as what was, in her mind, a worst case scenario. Hopefully. If it was any longer than that, then they really needed to try to find a way there beyond walking or maybe even just horseback.
Star Lumina	"[Gurhalian] Maybe if you took off sprinting and didn't stop, yeah," said Ricca with an apologetic air about her words, recognizing how time was a factor for these folk. "It'd be six months as the crow flies. Not ta mention you'll wanna steer clear of the Sun Sands here," she said, pointing out a section of the map starting from where the sun and star planes connected on the eastern-most border, lazily stretching south-west in a curve, and connected to a mountainous region. If taking the most direct route from Neet to the star plane, these 'Sun Sands' were in the way. "Unless you're a whole lot better at coping with the heat than you look, that is. I hear even in the peak of winter where your nose is gonna fall off your face, it's still scorching enough to boil the water in your waterskin if you leave it in the sun." Certainly seemed that this destination was chosen to redirect the group to be as far away and to make it as difficult as possible to get where they were going. Star chimed in: "[Gurhalian] Thank you for all your help, Ricca," said Star with a smile, then switched languages to speak to Ellesandra, while also allowing their companions to understand. "[Common] The reason for going to the star plane was to go to Hotenz for work, as it would have been convenient to start there and set ourselves up for the road. We might instead find a little work to do here to offset some cost of travel and maybe some teleportation services. Ultimately, I need to go to the moon plane, back to my home of Veldime." She pointed then on the map to a section on the moon plane that was tucked against the western coast of the moon plane. The country outline was clearly labeled as 'Veldime', and Star pointed to a specific place within Veldime labeled as 'Snowhaven'. Her home. Pointing to that, Ricca looked a little...Uncomfortable for a moment. Ears flattened on top of her head, but she didn't say anything.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra let out a soft breath at the running analogy. She glanced at the map again, then shook her head at coping with heat. She tapped the front of her breastplate as if indicating that it really didn't do well in strong heats; she'd melt within it based on the heat being described. She turned her attention to Star when she chimed in, nodding. That made sense, they didn't really need to go the Star plane anymore. They could go straight to Moon, considering their current situation and location. A glance was given over to Ricca, however, when she noticed the difference in posture. She looked back to Star, to see if Star noticed anything, but asked. "Do you see any issues with getting over to Snow Haven, Miss Ricca?" She was hoping they could find a different form of travel rather than walking; teleportation would be ideal and they'd have to speak to this Father about that later. But for now, getting an idea from a local if there was anything specifically dangerous with their target location was important, so Ellesandra had focused all of her attention back on Ricca.
Star Lumina	Ricca took a few more moments to shift uncomfortably as the question was posed to her. "[Gurhalian] O-Oh, uhm, n-not exactly...T-That is, I've heard you wanna stay out of these forests," she said, pointing to a vaguely circular forested area that bordered a long river. It was vaguely in the way of where they would be going, drawing a straight light from Neet to Snowhaven. It would be easy enough to avoid, just would add a few days of travel. "Heard that place is infested not just with nar lillies, but even a few ob lillies," she said, evoking a surprised look from Star. "[Gurhalian] Ob lilies? Really? I thought those were culled to extinction," she remarked. Ricca shook her head. "Aye, no, the Guardians tried, but they burst into spores when they die, so I hear. Had a Guardian walking through here about oh, three months ago, said they were checking the area for ob lily infestation. Thankfully there's nothing of the sort here. All we've got is a problem with some crimson lageks," she said, pausing to rub at the back of her head to look away. The sort of look that spoke of how bad of a problem it was, but the girl was too polite to ask to impose. "A-Anyway, uhm. Snowhaven just...Well, I wouldn't wanna be spreading any rumours that aren't true, but I just...I heard that place was...Razed, and all." Star met that news with a soft, sorrowful nod. "I know. I'm not expecting there to be much left. But I'm hoping for more information on what happened there all those years ago." It was as good a place to start as any. But it did also mean that it was unlikely to be their final stop. And with the scale of this world, they would need to figure out a way to get around it that didn't involve walking from point to point.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked down at the forests indicated. She had no idea what Ob lilies were, though it sounded like there were some definite strange dangers here. Star would need to be relied upon to point these out, and she'd make sure to ask Star this evening to give them a knowledge dump of the flora and fauna that might be of danger during their travels. She definitely agreed though, that walking to this place was not really a true option considering the time crunch they were under. If there was a way to get there faster, it would be much better considering Aurora was probably not being treated the best within her confinement. "Are there any other major dangers around, Miss Ricca? Looking at things like bandits, any types of large scale fighting going on or beast migrations? Things that we may need to keep in mind during our travels, no matter which form of travel we end up taking?" She glanced over to Amara and Amelia as well. This was...a lot more travel than they'd probably signed up for, and she had to ask herself if they were going to be willing to follow along with the plan. Or perhaps they'd have to break off as soon as Amelia got her language spells setup? She wasn't sure, but they weren't exactly going to be 'exploring' lands on their way. They had a mission, after all.
Star Lumina	Ricca was at a bit of a disadvantage with all these people overhearing her name and not getting any introductions in turn, but she could tell these people were on a mission so she wasn't going to hold them up with pleasantries. "[Gurhalian] Well, like I said there are crimson lageks running around here, one hurt Keiko pretty bad when she was off trying to gather some fruits in the forest. She's still with Father Copia, hopeful she'll pull through but the wounds were pretty bad." An admission that had Star looking at Ellesandra briefly. Of course, healing was her calling. It wasn't about money, though in their current situation she'd not refuse generosity. Someone was hurt. "Other than that there's nothing major...Bandits don't really come this way much, not too much valuable stuff to steal here. Though as you head inland I hear there has been a whole lot of trouble stirring. Bunch of folk dressed all in black and wearing masks attacking people. We keep everyone safe in their homes by sundown, ain't nobody wants to attract any trouble here." Amelia and Amara were getting a working translation quietly from Star as this went. Summaries of what was said. It certainly looked troubling to them, though they looked steady as ever about the prospect of moving ahead.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra hadn't even considered the dynamic of not sharing names. She was in a 'get information' direct attitude right now. At the information about this Keiko getting hurt, she glanced over to Star and nodded to her. It made sense for her to go help when they were done here. If nothing else, it would make Father Copia more likely to help find a way for them to travel. And, well, this person would be healed if she was badly injured and if Father Copia wasn't able to handle the healing himself. She looked back at Ricca. "We'll stop by the temple shortly to see if we can't provide any assistance in healing this Keiko, and to ask Father Copia about travel methods. Thank you very much for the information, Miss Ricca." Ellesandra reached down to the coin pouch that she still had - since they hadn't thought to give the money back to Star now that she could use her magic again - and pulled out a few silver as an appropriate tip for the conversation. Turning back to their group, she spoke up again. "So, anything else needed in regards to looking at this map or shall we go speak with Father Copia to get a better idea of the danger nearby and travel methods? Depending on what those might be, we can potentially come back here to spend a night before setting out."
Star Lumina	While Ricca had been helping only out of the kindness of her own heart, and thusly was confused by Ellesandra just dropping silver on the bartop, it remained true that this village was not extraordinarily wealthy. The couple of silver that Ellesandra casually provided was what the tavern would make on a big group, and this without the cost of replacing the ale would ensure the plucky bartender and her family would be able to feel that much more secure when the local lord came around to collect taxes. So, it was with a blush and a humble lowering of her head that Ricca accepted the kind gesture. Whether Ellesandra noticed the impact or not, Star certainly did. Nobody asked the knight to do that. But Star could see how touched Ricca was. No auramancy would be needed to see the approval writ on Amara's face. Amelia meanwhile was looking a little more...Pragmatic, then looked at Ellesandra. "Ask her how much for the map, and the carrying case. We'll pay double for it, since it might be harder for her to replace given how far away they are from a major city." Which, of course...Amelia could just wait until the group got to a city and bought a map there for a more standard price. But even if Amelia wasn't showing it, the circumstances and convenient reason to pay double spoke plenty about the woman's heart. "And if they have any other materials that provide useful insights - geography, reference materials, anything, well. The guild provides gold for just this purpose, no reason to not make use of it."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had pretended not to notice Ricca's obvious blush and acceptance of the coin. She didn't notice Amara's approval though, having been looking at Star, and then Amelia when she spoke up. Ellesandra looked confused for a moment as to why she was offering double before it clicked. A nod was given, and then she turned to look back at Ricca. "My companion here, Miss Whippersnapper, would like to inquire as to how much you might be willing to part with the map, and any other materials that might provide geography or cultural references. She would be willing to pay double what you might have paid for that map, considering the understandable difficulty of getting one here from any major city." A pause, and then she added just to poke at Amelia even more. "Forgive her for only speaking common, so unfortunately either I or Star -" She motioned to Star "will have to translate for her during this negotiation." Ellesandra had let a smirk tug at her mouth at being able to poke fun at Amelia again, but otherwise she looked entirely serious. Which, she was. If Amelia was offering to buy this map for double the price, she wasn't about to try to negotiate the price down for the guild; there was an obvious need for coin here and she wasn't about to tell the two Myst natives how to use theirs.
Star Lumina	There was a very small but purposeful thud against the back of Ellesandra's left shoulder coming from the aforementioned whippersnapper. A playful punch, but nothing further. Though crossed arms and a face that was trying and mostly failing to look unamused was present if Ellesandra looked over their shoulder. The brief look Ellesandra had given at Star had shown a beautifully bright smile. One that only grew bigger as the moment continued. Generosity was something Star loved to see, and loved to practice. That she had such a unique gift could have allowed her to walk a lucrative path, pricing her capabilities high knowing there wouldn't be anyone else who could do what she can. Yet she always kept just enough to get by modestly. Things were different now, at least until their quest was complete. Gold could be the difference between life and death in the way of ensuring they were properly armed to face whatever was standing in their way. So it was a much needed soothing of her natural desire to give to those in need seeing all that happened here. While Ricca was hardly squalid, this certainly did seem like the sort of place that was tight knit, and the money would over the next few months get spread around well enough. Here was hoping the local lordship wasn't the sort to catch wind of it and find reasons to take it all away. Of course, maps were no easy thing to make. Cartography took years of exploration and vetting of scales and accuracy. This map before them seemed to be of decent quality. Well-maintained, certainly. It detailed geography and some major settlements, fewer smaller settlements, but mostly showed country borders. One map wouldn't be enough for Myst. The more maps they could compare, the better, in fact, to understand what was true without having to have someone personally vet the accuracy by visiting the locations in question. The fact that the map showed Snowhaven still existing on the map suggested that it was older, however. At least as old as when Star was sent away from her home, unless that section of the map was simply copied from other maps. Or perhaps it remained listed, regardless of its state. Whatever the case, Ricca perked up again and was left visibly uncomfortable at the idea of having to price her map. Not because it meant anything to her. It was just a map. But she was just a girl who grew up in a simple village. She didn't know how to price things, and that uncertainty was clear. And that was compounded by the promise of a major windfall. Poor people often grew nervous at the prospect of riches. "[Gurhalian] E-Excuse me a moment, please," she said, raising a hand to hastily move into the back room again. Quiet conversation carried on, privately. The two whose hearing might be keen enough to pick up on the conversation if they had a reason to - which they didn't, really - also didn't speak the language. Ricca returned after a minute or two, smoothing her hands over her apron to calm herself, then gave a smile at the group, plucking the map case from where she had deposited it earlier along the way. "U-Uhm, papa says that the map was given to him by a friend, but it'd cost us about seventy-five gold to replace it." An honest answer by any approximation. Truly accurate cartography was worth a whole lot more than just the materials it was made from. But Ricca didn't seem to have a dishonest bone in her body. Star would be able to tell if the woman was lying, anyway, but Star just kept on smiling. Star took the liberty of relaying the price to their companions. Amelia and Amara had no clear reservations on that price. So fifteen platinum coins were counted out and placed on the bar top. Ricca looked like she had never seen platinum in her life. She had a very uneasy look about her, as if worried this was all some elaborate scheme. She carefully plucked one of the coins from the pile to examine it against the light. While not uncommon for people to briefly examine coins to ensure their authenticity, this was clearly someone examining something they had never seen before, confirming the earlier look. The woman looked a little overwhelmed, but did snap out of it to, with slightly shaky hands, carefully roll the map back up and slide it back into its case like it was a fine piece of art that dare not be damaged. She closed the case and held it out to Amelia, who smiled sweetly at Ricca and took it, handing it to Amara, who slung the case by its leather strap over her shoulder. There was a touched, gracious expression on the fox-woman's face. Star leaned in over the bar, smiling with that knowing, reassuring smile of hers. Of course Star could see exactly what was going on in the bartender's heart. "I know it's a lot, all at once, Ricca. Four strangers wandering in out of nowhere, asking all these questions, throwing around this kind of money. I hope it does a lot of good for you, and the people of Neet. You seem like kind folk. You deserve good tidings."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had staunchly ignored the punch, playing it off as if it hadn't even been felt. Ricca heading off into the back to discuss with someone wasn't surprising, and in the meantime Ellesandra had turned to glance at the group, then around the Inn again. With them discussing money like this, she wanted to ensure no one nearby had been closely listening or eyeing them with the predatory look of a bandit or pickpocket. Once Ricca came back out and stated the price, she glanced over to Amelia and Amara as Star translated the price. Ellesandra hadn't honestly expected Amelia to pay double that price. That was...honestly, a lot of coin, even for Ellesandra these days. Oh, she'd seen plenty more coin passed around by Marigold before, but beyond their windfall from Morrun she hadn't seen that much going al together since leaving her home. They certainly were gracious with the guilds resources, considering they'd also all but gifted Ellesandra a very fine rapier, magical as well. Star's reassurance to Ricca wasn't surprising, considering how Star could surely see nerves and probably other things in the bartender. With that business done, Ellesandra lightly knocked her knuckles on the top of the bar counter then pulled away. "Alright then, thank you Miss Ricca. We'll be off to see the Father. If the transportation needs and business requires us stay for the night, are there rooms available here?" She wanted to ensure Ricca that if they needed to stay, Ricca would have more of their business. Not that it was a guarantee they would need to stay, but Ellesandra had a sneaking suspicion the father didn't just have a teleportation stone or or circle lying around that he'd let them use scot free without helping the town out. Perhaps taking care of this problem that had injured someone? She wasn't sure, but she wasn't expecting this next conversation to go entirely easily.
Star Lumina	Ricca gave a hasty nod at Ellesandra's words. "[Gurhalian] R-Really, honestly, c-consider the rooms yours to use however long you need!" she said, her fingers still lightly trembling. The implication being that they wouldn't be charging the group for the rooms. "There's a-ah, six rooms in the back, just a bunch of single bed rooms." Of course, this being such a small place, the inn was simple, and the amenities were similarly sparse. There was a single shower to share among the rooms, something that rarely mattered as the only times the tavern's rooms got used was when the odd traveling merchant wandered through. Decided lower in amenities than Myst or even the inn from Cloverport, but it was...Cozy. The other people in the tavern had taken note of the adventurers, but the patrons were simple folk. There wasn't any sly looks going to the group. The others minded their own business, though they could obviously overhear it all with their keen furry ears. The feeling in the air was very much one of a mix of awe and intimidation. Actual knights in shining armor between Amara and Ellesandra, not a sight often seen in a place like this. The people here weren't troublemakers on their worst days, so they were on extra good behavior given the obvious weapons being carried by people who obviously knew how to use them. "We'll be sure to pay the standard rate for the rooms if we need them," said Star, wearing her usual soft smile as she subtly reinforced that they weren't going to be staying for free. Star could tell that Ricca needed a minute to process all of that, maybe take the coin back to that other unseen man - their father, it sounded like - and celebrate a little. So she casually nudged with her head to lead the group out of the tavern, if there was no other business, to move over to the church they had seen more central in the city.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had shaken her head when Ricca said that the rooms were theirs. She did nod at the information about there being six rooms. That would mean they'd need to use two, or three? She glanced at Amelia and Amara curiously, but would assume they would each want their own room. Her and Star would be sharing a room for obvious protection reasons. Not for any other reasons at all. Nope. She refused to admit that to herself. With Star's not so subtle hint for them to head out towards the church, Ellesandra turned and began heading towards the door. She'd open it and do a cursory sweep of her eyes around, again keeping a feeling out for any nearby shadows, but assuming the coast was clear would hold the door open for the rest of the group before falling in line with them towards the church. She didn't speak until they were a few steps away from the tavern, but when she did she directed her words to Amelia and Amara. "We should probably ask now so we're on the same page, Star and I will be sleeping in the same room. I can't guard her if we're separate. Will you two be sharing or should we get three rooms anytime we stop somewhere? Also, this is probably moot considering the coin you just spent on that map, but will you be struggling for funds if we stay at taverns along the way or will we be fine on that front?"
Star Lumina	The group piled out of the tavern to find that the dirt road was dirty, the air was airy, and the people were exactly as calm and idle as they had been when they entered. It did truly feel like a town where nothing much happened, and people could just live a slow life. The furry-eared children who were playing tag had settled, burning out most of their energy, and were sitting and patiently listening to a story being told by what looked to be a clergy member in front of the church. A man dressed in white, reading from a leather-bound tome. A bit too far away to hear what it was about. Amara and Amelia looked at each other when hearing Ellesandra's question. Amara answered: "If money gets tight, Amelia and I can bunk together, but generally we keep more than enough to cover separate rooms. And when the entire First Crusaders are together, well. We'd not fit in that tavern's rooms, so we have usual partners for doubling up. Amelia usually bunks with Ayden." Amelia rolled her eyes. "Much to my displeasure, the big lummox snores like a dragon, and doesn't even stop when I jam my elbow into his fat rib," said Amelia, surely demonstrating what a nice relationship she had with her brother. Amara chuckled. "The costs for lodging for you two can come from our guild funds as well. We've taken a fair amount with us, but given all that's happened, it might be prudent for Amelia and I to return to Myst tonight on our own before bed and inform of the situation and secure additional funds. It appears that your enemies fully intend on keeping us away from our goal, so while I initially planned on Amelia and I making frequent trips to and from Myst, if we just end up back in the field over yonder," said Amara with a backwards nudge of her head. "Then that might be off the table. If we end up traveling halfway across the sun plane only to go back to Myst and be booted back to the southern corner, well...Your mission cannot afford such delays. Best we reassess and plan ahead. Even if there's no other reason to stay here tonight, I would say it's probably best we do for this reason alone. As to your original question, Amelia and I have our own funds we can spend on whatever, but travel expenses are, within reason, something I can expense to the guild." An unlimited coffer of travel expenses was certainly a nice boon to have, though it did seem they would need to come up with a figure that they could ask for up-front to fund everything they'd need, and then ration that out. "It also means we'll need to be more conservative with our expenditures, Amelia. I've no qualms with doing a good deed for the people here - on the contrary, I'm glad you did that. But when it comes to the rest of this journey, I believe we'll need to be more pragmatic. Much as it's a tenet of being a Follower to embrace altruism and do good where we can, we can't help everybody in the course of accomplishing our mission," said Amara. Amelia huffed. "Obviously, captain. I'm not Rinnie. You don't have to explain this stuff to me," she said, then paused and said something to herself, a little quieter: "...Still woulda given top coin...Nice map..." Yes, because it was all about the map, and nothing else; Amelia's denial stood like a ten foot tall mirror before Ellesandra, even if that denial of self was for reasons that were worlds apart from one another.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra looked between Amelia and Amara a few times. The light scolding from the captain was...not what Ellesandra had expected. If Amara was going to say anything about the payment, she'd expected it to be harsher. Then again, Ellesandra was used to a very firm hand when it came to command. Sia had definitely seen to that. The thing was, there was a little bit of disapproval in Ellesandra that Star might be able to see, but she didn't show it or say anything about it. "Understood. Your idea is a good one. It's also possible that the portal would only redirect if I and/or Star were with you, so if there is no magical limitation on you testing that it may be worth doing so. You two just happen to going the same direction, until Valie-bitch begins visiting either of you in your dreams warning you off from Star, I don't think you're a particular target of hers." She paused, then added. "And perhaps we should congregate in one room tonight before bed so I can give you the download on what happened, too." She'd almost forgotten that. She'd been trying to avoid thinking about explaining her 'death' to Star, knowing Star would be upset at her for all but actually asking for it, but that had also meant she wasn't thinking about sharing the information with Amelia and Amara. And if they were going to be travelling together, they definitely deserved to be kept in the loop. She glanced up to the priest and the group of kids all sitting around for a story as they neared, but she was silent, either listening to the group respond to her or just focused on going in this Father. It was possible this man was him, but she didn't want to interrupt story time if she didn't have to.
Star Lumina	Star looked curiously at the disapproval she saw in Ellesandra. A curious blink, but nothing more to it. Understanding Ellesandra's perspectives on things was something of a hobby for Star at this point. Just thinking and examining. Considering and contemplating. She did a lot of that, and even if she was good with people, had shown on multiple occasions that she did prefer to take a bit of a back seat unless she was needed. Not that she wasn't social, quite the opposite, but Ellesandra's direct manner of addressing things - while maybe not always ideal - had done well so far. She wondered what it might be that Ellesandra disapproved of. Then also had to wonder who 'Valie-bitch' was. Something Amelia pointed out, in no particular rush to pass up a chance to throw some playful attitude at Ellesandra. "I know it's easy for you to forget with you being senile and all, grandma, but now that we're in a safe place it's probably a good time to mention that you've been talking to yourself about a whole crapload of things since you got back out of that portal that exactly none of us have been able to follow. Soooo don't mind us all looking at you like a crazy person until you actually sit down with us and explain it all later," she said, briefly donning a smirk. She could have just said 'hey, you're talking about stuff you haven't explained at all to the rest of us', but she where was the fun in that? There was some ability to put two and two together with context of course, but it was true that a proper sit down was due. "If you don't mind putting your attitude on pause for five seconds, Amelia," said Amara, still clearly light-hearted and not genuinely reprimanding the woman. "I think it's fair to say that as long as we're aiding you two, we're legitimate targets. Better to assume so than assume we're safe, I'm sure you'll agree." A matter she didn't expect to lead to much disagreement. As they approached, the story the priest was speaking came into audible range, and it was clearly a light-hearted tale meant to reinforce the caution one must have around hags. The latter half that could be heard naturally had the valiant hero defeating the hag with non-violent means, power of friendship and love and all, but it clearly came with more serious undertones that hags were evil and not to be trusted. The more adult version that educated on the proper response being a sword to the hag's neck could wait until these children were grown and not quite such adorable, innocent fluffballs. The priest looked up at the group approaching, mindful of the stowed weapons, and looked to the children. "[Gurhalian] All right, children, that's it for today's story. Now I hear that Jezza has a surprise for you all, one that.." He paused, dramatically tilting his head up to smell at the air. "I think I can smell might be just about done. But you'll all have to be good and help her clean up afterwards, okay? Remember, everything's easier when we work together." The children acknowledged the man's words, but were clearly mostly just excited about this surprise that was likely food related. If Ellesandra focused on the smell in the air, there was just the tiniest, faintest smell of something tasty and sweet. Best guess might be...Pie? Or perhaps some other sweet pastry, and was wafting down from the bakery. As the children turned around, excited and eager to get to have dessert, their paths met with the group. Amara and Amelia being up front, one of them nearly ran head-first into Amara. Naturally, the captain's reflexes kept them from doing so with gentle, armored hands on the little fox's shoulders. The children looked to be no older than eight or nine. The child in question, who went a little pale not just because she nearly ran into Amara, but also because Amara was...Intimidatingly tall. "Woah, easy," said Amara, her voice as soothing and sweet as a mother's. The little girl didn't speak common, something Amara remembered after a moment. Amara then descended to one knee, hands easing off the little girl's shoulder. Communicating through a language barrier was hard, but...Amara reached into one of the pouches on her belt and produced four, paper-wrapped caramel candies. She unwrapped one to let the girl see it. Amara's eyes looked up to the priest, who had been a little wary, but there was a trustworthy air about Amara; while it took a whole lot more than just being a paladin and having a reassuring smile to get someone like Ellesandra trusting them, it worked quite well on the general public. Star, smiling at the small display, was sure to chip in her part to bridge the language barrier: "[Gurhalian] It's okay, little one," said Star with a similarly tender, sweet voice. "It's a caramel. Don't bite it, just suck on it," she said, then looked at the priest. "Is it okay?" she asked, deferring to him for permission. The other three children had paused for a moment as they observed the near accident, and the four sets of small eyes flicked to the priest for him to make the final call. The priest considered the look of the group for a moment. Wary, of course. Not that he'd distrust them all himself, but he was thinking about the children. To that end, he stepped forward and plucked one of the wrapped candies to unwrap and examine. Sight and scent. They were obviously candy just be looking at them. But no amount of scrutiny was too much when it came to children. "[Gurhalian] Have another?" asked the priest, to Star, who relayed the question to Amara, who nodded and reached into her pack to pluck another out. The priest then put the one he had taken into his mouth. All things that the children didn't quite understand, as made clear by the uncertain looks. The age-old adage of not taking candy from strangers came to mind, but the small town folk were clearly the trusting sort. Bad things rarely happened in this place. Great evils had nothing to gain from this place. So a little nod was given. "Go on, Marra, you can have those to tide you over while Jezza finishes up the pie," he said, earning some excited cheers from the children who moved in to be handed a candy each. They then each bowed to Amara before scurrying away. The priest gently folded his arms before him in pious greeting, briefly crunching the candy and swallowing before addressing them. "[Gurhalian] Sun bless you," he began. "How may I help you fine folk on this day?"
Ellesandra	That was exactly why Ellesandra was going to sit them down to chat tonight. But, she didn't have a chance to say that before Amara mentioned they were still targets while travelling with the two. A nod was given, even if that wasn't the point she'd really been making. No need to get into semantics right now, and they were right that they were in the dark a bit, so Ellesandra didn't feel irritated at the call out like she normally would have. In reality, she should have sat them down and talked with them about it before they agreed to come. It's not like they couldn't leave whenever if it got too much for them, but she doubted that would happen either way. As they approached the priest and he dismissed the children, Ellesandra was watching the priest more than she was the children. When one of them almost collided with Amara, she froze and glanced around, checking for a trap. A child as a distraction was an easy way to get normal guards or people off kilter or to let their guard down, after all. So when she found none, and simply observed the interaction between Amara, Star, and the child, she relaxed some. The suspicion and steps taken to validate the safety of the candy by the priest was also well respected too; he was a cautious man, and that was probably a good thing here. Strangers like them surely didn't venture into town too often. As he gave the same sun blessing greeting that the bartender had, Ellesandra considered returning it. She eventually decided not to though, glancing at Star briefly and then at the kids who had been running off, before focusing on the man again. "Good day. Ricca at the tavern suggested we come talk to you in regards to potential transportation across the sun plane, as well as mentioned there was an injured villager here who may need assistance. We have an excellent healer in our midst who might be able to help, if that's the case and needed." Ellesandra didn't indicate to Star as being the healer. Depending on the man's intentions, pointing out who was the main healer of their group could be potentially threatening to them. Sure Amara was surely capable of healing too, but Ellesandra didn't know the extent of her powers and didn't want to speak for her.
Star Lumina	Star gave a strange glance at Ellesandra. Not a judgmental one of course. Just one that was about as confused as when Ellesandra went looking in the shower when they arrived at Myst, and, she suspected, had half a mind to check for monsters under the bed, too. Ellesandra was paranoid. But Star had known them long enough at this point to know that, and that it probably served them well as a guard. But Star was such a trusting person that the notion that someone would use children as a distraction to trap them was so unfathomably alien to her that it earned the briefly confused look. She didn't comment, of course, just assuming Ellesandra was being careful, which she didn't mind. The priest gave a difficult look, but ultimately a thankful one. "[Gurhalian] Ah, she has told you about Keiko. Most fortunate that you have a capable healer, yes," he said, gesturing to the church doors. "Please. Come in, let me take you to Father Copia. As well I...Notice you might prefer to speak Common. Father Copia and I do know Common, if you'd prefer to converse in that language. Whatever is easiest for you."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had ignored Star's strange glance at her. She didn't know what it was about, and there was no point in asking right now. It would involve an unnecessary conversation about why Star thought something was strange to begin with, which would lead to talking about her seeing auras, which might make people uncomfortable. Instead she focused on the priest, and then nodded. "Yes, Keiko. And if you speak Common, that would be great. Unfortunately two of my companions here don't speak Gurhalian or currently have access to the magic which would allow them to understand. Easiest if we can all understand eachother without need of translation." She would wait for the priest to begin moving before starting forward though. She was very polite about it and made it look absolutely natural, giving him a soft smile and motioning for him to lead the way while they followed behind. If he did lead the way into the church, she would step in first and do her customary sweep of the place before continuing in to allow Star and the rest in behind her, only to quickly fall back to being beside Star.
Star Lumina	The priest nodded. "[Common] Very well, then we shall speak in Common," he said, earning a look of relief from Amara and Amelia. "Glad the language lives up to its name to some degree still," said Amelia, mostly to herself. As they moved into the church, it would prove to be about as small and intimate as expected based on the exterior. A small chapel for services. There were polished wooden pews, an ornately worked stone pedestal that held a glass bowl of water near the entrance, and thin white carpet running up along the main passage between the pews to the altar. Behind the altar was a magical, illusory image of a waterfall descending into a pool of still water. The imagery clearly had major significance, which Ellesandra would be able to identify as the holy symbol of the goddess Eldath, a pacifist goddess who served Silvanus, and was known as the Mother of Waters or Goddess of Peace, serving the tenets of serenity, comfort, and healing. Star looked at the holy symbol with recognition and warmth. Naturally, it was a goddess whose message resonated with Star personally, even if Star herself wasn't all that religious. Eldath was often associated with druids, but had a general following among pacifists of all sorts. It certainly explained the trusting nature of the fox folk here if this was the dominant religion. The chapel had stained glass windows depicting images of Eldath in various poses, and two people could be seen quietly praying in the pews. They looked just the same as anyone else in the village, and did clearly seem to be looking for peaceful solitude here. "My name is Father Verma," he said gently, voice lowered while in the chapel. "I am a student of Father Copia. I will be taking over the service of this chapel when the time is right, but for now any matters concerning the village should be brought to him," he explained, mostly to ensure the others knew that he was doing this not because he wasn't able to help them, but he had to respect the order of things. He moved with the group quietly to a passage behind the altar, leading up a set of steps to a medium-sized room that had two beds, one empty and one with a wounded fox woman laying, unconscious, under a blanket with a wet rag on her forehead, fluffy white tail hanging slightly out of the side of the blanket. Father Copia himself was seated at the far side of the room at a desk, faced away. An older man, not so old that he struggled to move, but defined wrinkles yet unseen and grey hair and fur showed he was likely in the latter half of his life. "[Common] Excuse me, Father Copia, I have brought visitors from outside the village," he said, stepping aside and gesturing to the group. Father Copia looked over his shoulder and then slowly stood. He had a gentle set of eyes and black, formal robes. "Ah, Sun bless you all, and the peace of the Mother of Waters as well be upon you," said Father Copia. "They have come seeking aide in traversing the planes, and have mentioned they have a talented healer among them who may be able to help Keiko, Father," said Father Verma. Father Copia nodded. "Aye, very good, very good. Please, travelers. Tell me what you seek, so we may aide one another." While the men conversed, Star gave worried looks over at Keiko, the wounded fox woman. Her natural instinct was to just...Rush to help them. But Ellesandra had purposefully not pointed her out, and she knew that wasn't without cause. So she let them take the lead, ready to move to the woman when given some sort of signal that it was time to do so.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra followed along, her eyes scanning along the church as they went. She obviously noted the signs to Eldath, but didn't comment on it. The interest and the apparent recognition by Star was noted, but again she didn't say anything on it. She was on her guard as they moved through, watching for anyone to be in wait somewhere, and as they stepped into the room with the injured Gurhalian she did another quick glance around. Star wasn't keeping her interest in rushing to Keiko hidden well Ellesandra hadn't thought...or maybe she was just becoming more in tune with Star's habits, interests, and getting better at reading her. Either way, she reached out to lightly lay a hand on Star's arm, before turning to meet Father Copia. "Good day, Father Copia. I am Ellesandra, and my companions are Star, Captain Amara, and Amelia." She would motion around, introducing all of them as they had been introduced to her. She wasn't sure if Amara wished to keep or drop the Captain title, but she'd rather be over cautious and respectful than not so. "Normally I'd like to get right into it, but I don't want to give any implication that our offer to assist Keiko here is dependent on your willingness or ability to help us in our travel. If it is okay with you, may Star take a look at them to see what she can do to help via mundane magic, if anything?" That would be the first focal point of their conversation. An olive branch, obvious intent to help rather than bargain their ability to help, as well as to allow Star to go check on Keiko rather than being on edge and looking at her worryingly the whole. Ellesandra had glanced over at Keiko only enough to show she wasn't an obvious threat, and there was no feeling of shadow from her, but assuming there had been none she'd continue to get Star to her sooner rather than later. She had, however, specified via mundane magic. Hopefully Star picked up on that and didn't suddenly try her sympathetic healing on the woman if it wasn't necessary.
Star Lumina	The term 'mundane magic' had confused looks spawning on the faces of everyone except Star. That was an oxymoron if one had ever been spoken, but the benefit of the doubt was given and truly, there was no point in trying to figure out what that meant. All that mattered was the offer to help. "Of course, of course," said Father Copia. "Please. Anything you can do. She was struck by a crimson lagek. Her wounds are grievous. I have been able to keep her stable with some potions I was able to brew, but her wounds have been serious enough to warrant keeping a close eye on her," explained the priest. Star smiled at Ellesandra. The touch on her arm had been enough to bridge their emotional connection to reaffirm that Star was deeply concerned for the wounded woman. The worry was significant, but contained. The fox woman was obviously stable. Once released, Star moved to the woman's bedside and drew the blanket back to get a look at them. The point of injury was obvious. Their lower abdomen, entry point from the right side, curving to the left. Blood on the bed below them suggested it was an impaling wound. The blood pattern on the bandages gave the wound's definition a straight shape, but far too tall to be that of a sword blade. Naturally, since it was said to come from what sounded to be some sort of creature, it was likely a natural weapon. Perhaps a talon? It looked vaguely close to that. Star moved to sit on the edge of the bed and moved a hand over the site of the wound, gently resting her palm over it. She closed her eyes, then, and sat in quiet focus. While doing this, the most peculiar thing happened. Atop Star's head spawned two furry fox ears, complete with white fur, along with a white fox tail poking out from under her skirt. The conversation with the priest would naturally begin again here, but understandably this change drew the eyes of everyone else in the room as surprise and astonishment washed over them all for what they were seeing. Did...Star just turn into a fox woman?
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had watched carefully as Star moved over to Keiko. She didn't care if the others were confused at the mundane magic comment. Star seemed to understand, and that's all that mattered. She'd waited until Star was settled and began to work before turning back to Father Copia. "While she's doing that, perhaps you can tell us about these Crimson lagek? Ricca also mentioned them but I'm afraid I don't know what-" She trailed off, eyes turning back to look at Star who now had fox ears and a tail. That...was new. She didn't even mask the surprise on her face. Was she just taking on a form similar to that of her patient, or was that a more natural form for her? It didn't make sense that it was just an illusion magic, considering she hadn't had them in Myst where magic was limited. It could be something with her aura, but then again Ellesandra didn't remember seeing the ears or tail even in Star's memory with her mother. No, this had to be some side effect of how she was healing Keiko. Ellesandra hoped that didn't mean Star was using her sympathetic healing, but she wasn't about to interrupt and potentially cause an issue. "Know what they are." She finished finally, turning her eyes back to Amelia and Amara to confirm they were just as confused as she was, before looking at the priest. "If we're to spend any real time in this area - and we plan to stay the night here, at the very least - we should be aware of the potential dangers or beasts around."
Star Lumina	That the conversation was continuing in the face of whatever was happening was a little jarring. Everyone just going to ignore that? Yeah? All right. Amelia and Amara were exactly as confused as Ellesandra, as were the two priests. Father Copia cleared his throat. "C-Crimson lagek are a somewhat common predator species in the sun plane. They have a naturally armored carapace, and most closely resemble grasshoppers. Though, they are about twenty feet long from tail to head on average, and stand and walk on six sharp legs. The main concern with them is that they are able to spit a jet of sticky threads from their maw, which very swiftly can immobilize people. It's not impossible to break out of, but for those of us who aren't meant for battle, it's all but a death sentence. They have long, scythe-like claws they use to strike their prey, usually after immobilizing them. Their carapace is a dark red colour, hence their name. They also may try to trample you, or bite. If you're planning to fight one, you must be cautious. They have acidic blood that will melt mundane armor, and have three hearts." Father Copia sighed. "If it sounds like a lot, I'm sure you can imagine why we've been much happier to lure them away with cuts of koltava meat from the cattle ranch we have here, rather than risk anyone fighting such a beast. It is a sub-optimal solution, of course. The repeated feeding has no doubt kept the beast coming back for more, which led to it being close enough to harm Keiko here. But the alternative was that we try to chase it off with torches, and in doing so risk the lives of the men here. It may be too mighty a beast to be threatened by such a thing, and we have been awaiting aide from the crown, but thus far we have not heard any response from King Laho or his lords or ladies, and each month when the tax collector comes we are told simply to wait, and continue to try and lure it away. I'm afraid more injuries like Keiko's are only a matter of time. But, if Miss Star here is able to heal her, then we may yet be done with this issue before then, once the kingdom sends its aide. So...What was it you needed, then? Travel, was it?" Just as Ellesandra had not held back Star's help as a bargaining chip, so too was the priest offering his aide openly. He had shared the truth of the dangerous monster that plagued them, but did not ask the group to take on such a task, and did move along to what they needed without expectation.
Ellesandra	Why waste time being curious? She wasn't about to interrupt Star to ask, and they could ask Star later. It wasn't like they couldn't get work done, and them all hovering around Star while she was healing might just distract her. No, best to continue with the conversation. As the creature was explained, Ellesandra frowned and her concern deepened, looking over towards the woman on the bed, injured. "Sounds like a dire beast indeed." She commented dryly. There was no need, or point, in offering to help right now. That would require discussion, even if the thought had crossed her mind. She had been serious when she'd told Star, and shown her that memory of being late to training, that they needed to focus on their mission. But if their mission just so happened to put them in the path of this beast - well. Ellesandra wasn't about to look the other way in that situation. Refocusing on the task at hand, she continued. "Star and I are seeking a way to the Moon plane, specifically around where Snowhaven used to be. We understand that there have been some troubling reports from there and it no longer stands, but it is our destination nonetheless. Captain Amara and Amelia are here as..." She paused. Did they introduce themselves as ambassadors of Myst or anything? She looked towards them, leaving it open for them to introduce themselves however they wished. Whether that be their real purpose here, seeking magical artifacts and the like and documenting culture of Gurhal, or if they wanted to say they were simply along for the ride on Star's mission. She wasn't about to speak for them and their goals here, not knowing their protocols on such.
Star Lumina	"Comrades, of course," said Amara once she realized it was being passed to her to speak. "And of course, just 'Amara' is fine," she said more for Ellesandra than for the priests. Father Copia gently nodded. "Aye, I'd heard of grim tales from Snowhaven, but it is a world apart from us. Though the old suffering teaches us that we are one people, there truly is no reasonable aide we here in Neet could provide," said Father Copia with remorse clear in his voice. "I am afraid I cannot offer you any information on what it is like over there. But, what I can provide, while not a direct answer to your troubles, is something that will be of more use to you than it is to me. You see," he continued, briefly clearing his throat. "I was once a member of King Laho's army, before Eldath's light brought peace to my life, and before my tied old body protested most vehemently against my continued armed efforts. I have...And old friend, the air captain of the Seventh Fort, specifically. If not he himself, he will know how best to secure you transit upon an airship. I would be happy to write you a letter that vouches for your generosity. An airship will be able to carry you to Snowhaven, or at least the nearest major city; such a trip would be quite expensive, but I trust my old friend to find something that will work." Expensive might be relative. What was expensive to the people of this simple village might prove to be chump change for the Followers of Myst, though their available funds remained to be seen. But if they could secure the service of an airship, it would surely allow freedom of transit across all of Gurhal. Months would become days. And while it wasn't as instant as teleporting, it was certainly AN option. Just as long as nobody was afraid of heights.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded to Amara at her explanation. Just comrades then, and no captain. She'd note this going forward and for future introductions. When Father Copia continued to speak about his days in the military, Ellesandra did take a moment to look at him again. She wouldn't have previously guessed he was a military man, but it didn't really change anything now. "We would appreciate that, I think. There is no rush, as we're planning to do some things tonight and then stay at the Tavern to plan our next steps. Where may we find your old friend? Is he in town, or shall we plan our trip to a neighboring fort to request assistance?" Like always, Ellesandra was to the point. No need to beat around the bush and comment on his military history or that she'd never been on an airship before. They could discuss later what that might look like for the group, and if there were any issues with it. She did glance over at Star, eyeing the new ears particularly. There was a...temptation. To reach out and pet them, scratch behind their ears. She obviously resisted this temptation, not only because she didn't want to distract Star form healing Keiko but also because it would be entirely inappropriate to do in public, or without Star's permission, and was definitely not something she should do as Star's guard. Definite line she shouldn't cross there. Right?
Star Lumina	There was a general nod of agreement about them appreciating getting an airship, or just the chance at it. It was better than walking. And while traversing the entirety of the realm would still take them a week or so, or thereabout, they were looking at the better part of a year to cross it on foot. The plane was great and vast, and there would be no way to properly traverse such distances if foot and horse travel was all they had. "Ah, my friend, his name is Albert Lamington, he is stationed at the Seventh Fort, a day's travel afoot north of here. It is a military garrison so you will likely not be able to stay and rest there, either, but about an hour inland from there is the town of Lidiera, along the coast. It's a fishing village, but the flat ground there was used to prepare and launch airships when I was still part of the military. Were I a betting fox I would wager that would be the best chance for boarding an airship around here," explained Father Copia. As he finished explaining, however, a heavy breath left Star, and her magic subsided. She blinked a few times as she opened her eyes, and her ears and tail simply vanished with a soft puff of silent blue magic like they were never there to begin with. She looked at Keiko, who was slowly opening their eyes. She smiled, seemingly either unaware or uncaring about how she was just a fox-woman for a handful of minutes there. Keiko moved to sit up, but Star laid a hand on their should. "[Gurhalian] Shhh, hey, no no no...Easy. Easy. You don't wanna sit up just yet. You're better now, but, the healing is just freshly done. Give it at least a few hours before you move around, just to be sure it doesn't tear open again," she said, smiling sweetly at the woman. Keiko looked at Father Copia, who was overcome with relief at seeing the woman awake. "[Gurhalian] Do as she says, child. She has healed you out of the kindness of her heart, she has my trust, so too should she have yours," said Father Copia, evoking a soft nod from Keiko, who then looked up at Star with a great deal of gratitude in her eyes. "[Gurhalian] Thank you, miss. I-I...I don't know how I cou--" began Keiko, interrupted by Star: "Shh, no, I won't have you thinking you owe me. That you're alive and well is all that matters," said Star, slowly rising from the bed to return to Ellesandra's side, then gained a bit of a weird look about her as she saw the weird look that Amelia and Amara were giving her. She looked at Ellesandra, the confusion clear as day. Did she have something on her face?
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded. Albert Lamington. A days journey away, potentially staying in some place named Lidiera. That wouldn't be so bad. They could discuss that progress later when in their room. "We appreciate that, Father." She was soon distracted, however, as the puff of blue magic surrounded Star and Ellesandra turned to her quickly. Her hand was already reaching for her weapon, unsure what the puff was, but she didn't draw it. She just watched as the tail and ears just...disappeared. And she seemed to pull away, while Keiko woke. A glance was given between Keiko and the Father, then back to Star as she reassured the fox woman that she was fine and safe but needed to rest. With Star returning to her side, with everyone looking at her oddly, Ellesandra just raised her hand and patted the top of Star's head. "That's unfortunate. Those ears were cute." Though she'd said this as an attempt to add humor and tease Star a little, the statement was true either way. It might also confuse Star, but they could explain that she'd grown a tail and ears during her healing later. Instead she just gave Star a smirk before looking back to Father Copia. "Is there anything else you'd like to discuss? I'm sure you need time to check on Keiko, let any family members know she's okay and write that letter you mentioned. We can stop back by here tomorrow morning to check in on her and pick up that letter before setting off, if that sounds alright?"
Star Lumina	Ellesandra's response did not at all clear up the confusion on Star's face. It just made it worse. She blinked, raising a hand to tug at her right earlobe. Tug, tug. Her ear is cute? Or were they talking about Keiko's ears? She was quiet as the business was concluded, but that confusion was not going to go away without an explanation. The priest gently shook his head. "[Common] No, I think that is all for now. What you say is about the short of it. I will ensure everything is ready for tomorrow morning, yes. I appreciate all that you have done, more than I can express in words. Her husband and son will be elated to know she has recovered. Father Verma, would you like to go bear the good news to her family?" he asked of his student. The other priest nodded. "[Common] It would be my pleasure, Father Copia." With that, Father Verma gestured for the group to adjourn down the steps and back out of the church. If there was no business for him specifically, he was swift to head off down the short path to the residence of the family to share the good news, leaving the group their own devices again.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra knew it had just confused Star, but she didn't say anything yet. She nodded to Father Copia. "Thank you." And with that, she would follow Father Verma out of the church. She did look around, ensuring again as they went out no one was waiting for ambush or anything like that. When Father Verma headed off to let the family know the good news, she turned to look at Star with incredulity on her face. "Were you not aware that when you were healing Keiko, you had fox ears and a tail on your own body? I've seen you heal before - you've healed me, and I was in the camp a good amount when you were healing those elven soldiers. I never saw you have a tail or ears, or take on any aspect of them in your healings. Or me, for that matter." She kept her voice down enough that she wouldn't draw attention, but there was a mixture of amusement, a bit of disappointment that the ears weren't permanent, and also concern for Star. She hadn't been sympathetically healing Keiko, had she?
Star Lumina	Star was quite used to pain, but Star also wore just about every emotion she ever felt openly on her face. She hadn't shown much the one time she had used her sympathetic healing on Ellesandra, because it was really just some minor cuts. Annoying, and maybe she winced once or twice from them, but it wasn't a life-threatening wound. Truly, if she had used her sympathetic healing, she herself would be clutching the site of the wound and be visibly in pain. Even if she was a stoic warrior, it was a wound that impaled them all the way through - even if Ellesandra didn't piece that together from the limited evidence. All signs pointed to her being a good girl and using her more typical magic rather than auramancy to heal. So when Ellesandra pointed out what had happened, she went bright red in the face. "I-I-I what?!" she exclaimed, reaching up to the top of her head to feel for the ears that weren't there. "I-I mean I...It was a really bad wound so I needed to join our auras for a while there, b-but...But are you sure?!" Yes, better make sure that Ellesandra wasn't just having a fever dream and imagining that she sprouted fox ears and a tail.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra watched Star's obvious surprise, then shook her head. "No, I'm not sure, I totally imagined you growing ears and a tail. Just like I imagined everyone in the room stopping to stare at you." She reached up and ruffled Star's head where the ears had been, intentionally messing up her hair with a smirk. "Learning new things about your powers every day." Ellesandra appeared to be in a...playful mood? Well, she was certainly more smiley and interactive than she'd been most of the trip, that is. She glanced over at Amelia and Amara. "Or is this old granny losin her mind, Miss Whippersnapper?" To Amelia and Amara, it would just look like she was in a good mood, that was. Star would be able to see that Ellesandra was masking. She was trying to deflect with humor, in embarrassing Star so that Star didn't look too closely at Ellesandra's aura. She couldn't block that, but she could at least try to distract and deflect while she felt the not-so-caged feelings stirring strongly. The desire to have reached out, scratched at those ears. The feeling now to cup Star's face and tell her she did a good job, healing Keiko. The desire to kiss her on the forehead and call her a dork for not knowing that she grew ears and a tail. All of these were being fought against, and she was trying her best to prevent Star from noticing.
Star Lumina	It took Star all the way until the ripe old age of seven years old to be able to see straight through the deflection that Ellesandra was performing. To trust in what she saw in the aura, rather than what she saw someone doing or saying explicitly. There was no world where Ellesandra's deflection could hide what they felt. Hide their desires. It wasn't too dissimilar to how she saw through lies, though this was entirely rooted in fears rather than duplicity. Ellesandra had nothing but the most...Beautiful desires in their heart. So as Ellesandra went on joking about, they touched Star's head to ruffle her hair. Ellesandra felt a little rush of happiness, of good feelings, of mirthful, playful joy at that gesture. Of course Star was receptive to Ellesandra being happy. But that happiness wasn't going to mask the rest of her feelings, feelings that Ellesandra could no longer hide from just by not focusing on them. And those feelings burned against Ellesandra's hand when they touched Star. Like a bonfire's tongues of flame licking at the knight's skin, it was briefly intense. But it did not sear. It did not singe. It caressed. It kissed. It lovingly embraced their touch. It was the quiet voice in Ellesandra's ear, tenderly whispering to them as hands coiled around them and lips brushed against their earlobe. And the sweet words it whispered encouraged Ellesandra's feelings. Invited them. Told them in no uncertain terms that it was all not just welcome, but wanted. Badly wanted. Sorely wanted. Wanted with such strength of emotion that the ache it produced throbbed across Star's entire being. It was a feeling that had grown from sparks, from the small flame of a candle to a steady bonfire. There was still so much room for it to grow and blossom outward but...It was clear there was no going back now. The feelings once fledgling had become seated, spreading their roots deeper into Star's heart with every time their eyes locked, every time their fingers touched, every time she saw Ellesandra being the kind and compassionate and thoughtful woman they were. All of that...For just a moment. That it was just for a moment was the only saving social grace that might allow Ellesandra to keep a straight face through it. For tempering those feelings was...Understanding. Ellesandra's fears, their doubts, the plagues that mired their heart had not gone anywhere, and Star was emotionally mature enough to not brazenly act in haste in spite of these very real troubles. Star wanted to kiss Ellesandra on more than just their forehead or cheek. But it was from that same affection that she did not, for it was cruel to ignore the depths of Ellesandra's struggles, to minimize them or simply say with profound naivete that everything would be okay and just expect those words to cure everything. Such complexities were difficult to process in the matter of seconds that they were felt, but there would be time for them all to flow through Ellesandra and let the knight feel what there was to feel. And in the meantime, Star was left giggling at the hair ruffle. "H-Hey, you're gonna make it all messy and tangled," said Star mirthfully, moving her hands up to smooth out her hair again. Amelia of course chimed in to answer tease-for-tease: "I dunno, grandma, you're talking to yourself more and more these days, we can't rule out that possibility," she said, smirking and naturally latching onto the positive energy. "Maybe if I just, hmm..." said Star, pausing thoughtfully. "If I try to recall those feelings...It's not like shapeshifting or polymorphing is exactly groundbreaking for magic.." Star paused for a moment, focusing inward. Was she about to willfully assume that form again..?
Ellesandra	Ellesandra should have known better than to touch Star while she was trying to hide emotions from her. The feeling of Star's returned affection caused her to pull her hand away faster than she otherwise would have, even if she still ruffled Star's hair a little. She clenched her fist briefly, matching the clenched jaw as she worked to push the feelings she'd just had flood into her, burning desire from Star aside. To ignore it, and pretend she didn't notice. To pretend that her own feelings didn't flame up in response, demand that they go find their private room right this moment. She watched Star for a moment longer than she normally would have, eyes flicking down to her lips while she was so focused on trying to bring the ears back. After a pregnant pause from her, Ellesandra said - "Don't do anything that will wear you out, Star. You already healed someone today, and cast the language magic on me. Save your energy." And then she looked up to Amelia and Amara. "And, I'm sorry about that. Lets get ourselves a few rooms, settle in and then you two can meet in mine and Star's room? I'd rather not talk about all of this out in the public area of the tavern where the natives might be able to overhear." She wasn't sure that there was anything particularly bad about them overhearing, but best to be safe rather than sorry. She didn't know what any local cultural politics affected things, or if there might be spies.
Star Lumina	Ellesandra's pregnant pause was a bit too long to stop Star from what she was doing. By the time they had said not to wear herself out, pop! Ears and tail were back, though this time she was aware of herself. She blinked, twisting her figure to look over her shoulder at her newfound tail, and practiced swishing it back and forth a little. Then, eyes turned up, and those fox ears flicked and flexed a bit. "...Huh." Was all she had to say. And then just as soon as they arrived, they burst and vanished again just as before with a little burst of tiny motes of blue light that flickered away after a moment. "Oh, uh. And that was pretty minor. I did a fair bit of healing on Keiko, but you'd do well to remember that I was able to heal multiple life-threatening injuries in quick succession back with that whole Cloverport incident. It's just healing you that takes all I've got," she said, smiling as she laid a hand on Ellesandra's arm. A calm reassurance flowed from her, though she kept it brief as...The flame of affection was still there, and she could tell it was triggering a response, so she wasn't going to agitate that. "But I appreciate you worrying, always. I'm okay. Got plenty left, if I need it. Promise." Another smile. Then, the two girls from Myst nodded to the plan. "Aye, sounds good, though really there's nothing to apologize for, it goes without saying in my mind that much has happened, and we've not had much time to privately debrief on it all," said Amara. They were speaking in a language that demonstrably most of the people here didn't speak, but nobody was going to argue that talking in private about these matters was wise. If not spies, then generally just the chance someone overheard the crazy things they were going to talk about and understood them was a scenario best avoided. If all was agreed, then the group was free to execute on the plan. Rooms were paid, with only a small amount of pushback given from Ricca who tried to insist that enough had been paid already, but clearly didn't need much convincing to give into the truth that a little injection of wealth could do a lot of good for the people of Neet. Most in the village would see only a handful of silver added to their savings each month after costs of living and taxes were taken into account, so the sudden, all-at-once injection of over a hundred gold was monumental, and if used for community benefit could be the seed that started this town on the path to prosperity. A better life for the children. Ricca had a good heart to not give into greed, but thinking about the young kits and building a better life for them, and perhaps even her own children if she might find love someday broke any resistance. Coin was accepted, room keys provided, and Amelia and Amara got themselves settled in before joining Star and Ellesandra in their room. The rooms were, as expected, rather modest. Four walls, a bed, slightly creaky floorboards, two oil lanterns fixed to opposite walls that could be lit for light, and a window with shutters to let the natural light in, or to close and latch if one wanted privacy. The only furniture besides the bed, which was admittedly pretty comfy if simple, was a desk with a chair, and a trunk at the foot of the bed to store things in while staying. Naturally, expecting there to be limited seating based on their own lack of sitting area, Amelia and Amara hauled the chairs from their rooms in along with them, so everyone had a place to sit, though Star and Ellesandra could easily just sit next to each other on the bed, facing the other two in their chairs.
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had stared at the ears and tail again. Once again, something about them just made her want to scratch behind Star's ears. She didn't, though, the temptation well and truly controlled. The feelings she'd seen from Star at their touch were still fueling her own desire, but the idea of telling them all everything was doing a good job of dampening it. When they got to the tavern and got their rooms, Ellesandra had begun to take her armor off to get relatively comfortable for the explanation coming up, and had asked Star before Amara and Amelia came in whether or not she was comfortable with Ellesandra sharing details of Star's magic and their journey and such. She was pretty confident Star would be okay with this, it wasn't her story and information to share so she didn't want to do so without asking. With said confirmation, Ellesandra had chosen to pace at one end of the room instead of sitting on the bed next to Star. Star would be able to see a nervous energy about her, as she still hadn't decided how much of her OWN story she was going to share. She didn't feel comfortable sharing much with Star, let alone with Amelia and Amara. Once they were all in the room and sitting down, she reached up and tugged her hair out of her ponytail, mostly for something to do with her hands and play with the long strands while she spoke. "Okay, so before I start, please let me chat before interrupting about things." Ellesandra looked very pointedly at Amelia at this comment. "And a brief heads up on mine and Star's magic. I'm particularly resistant to any forms of magic that I've found, other than Star's Auramancy since it seems to interact with my aura rather than my physical body. Divine, arcane, nature based, - all of that tends to not work well on me. I can absorb the mana of a spell and translate it into my own magic, which is a more physical energy magic. Amelia, that's why my Haste spell takes so much out of me; it's burning my physical energy and power rather than any arcane mana. Conversion isn't one to one, and I can redirect magic with the conversion as well" She paused for a second, looking at Star, then continued. "And Star's magic is aura based. She can manipulate it differently, and thus in some ways bypass my innate resistance. She can also see auras, which helps her to be empowering to people and support them better both emotionally and magically. This makes her, and auramancers like her, natural leaders and people who tend to bring together enemies to join forces and such. A danger to those this wouldn't benefit, of course." That was a very, very quick summary, but Star could elaborate more on her powers later if she wanted to. That was enough detail for the point of what she was going to be sharing. "I know you probably have questions on that, but you can ask after. To start off, I ran into Star when just travelling on the road and she was being attacked by pirates. After taking care of them, we agreed to travel together to the closest town at the very least. Which was overrun by those very same pirates. Star explained her mission to return to her home plane, to find her mother who sent her away during an attack to protect her, and she was meeting up with an elven mage there who would be able to help direct her on how to do so. We met him, but found his wife was being held captured by the pirates. So, we staged a diversion and rescue for her, and escorted the two back to their elven settlement." She paused, running her fingers through her hair and lightly tugging on it. This was a completely unconscious movement, but one that helped keep her focused. The small pricks of discomfort at her hair being tugged kept her focused, somehow. It always worked for her when she had to share uncomfortable stuff verbally. "I was visited in my dreams during that time by a shadow calling themselves 'Black Diamond'. They were trying to scare me off from Star, warn me away from guarding her or letting her hire me. Implying that if I just left her alone, she would give up on her search for her mother, and therefore they would not be forced to kill her. Well, if you know anything about Star she's not one to give up even if I weren't there, so I figured that meant she needed protection even more." A deep breath. "So, we joined with elven soldiers and fought off the pirates in Cloverport, including a shadow-imbued captain that was like the three who appeared earlier today. Black diamond's commanders, so to speak. I stabbed him through the head and he just kept on fighting, almost killed me. Had to stab him through the gem in his heart to actually stop him - thanks to Star using magic to hold him in place for me. We got information about going to Myst then and where to find you all, but we took a few days rest to recover from that fight. During which, someone named Sapphire also appeared in my dreams, the supposed 'good' balance to Black Diamond. She's an angel and didn't appear as a shadow, so I knew a bit more about her. She prevented Black Diamond from just taking control of my dreams and giving me nightmares, like they'd been doing, and gave me the choice to have normal dreams or visit one of them to chat. I visited Sapphire one night and she confirmed that Star's mother is in fact alive, but is being help captive by Black Diamond." Ellesandra glanced at Star at this. There was still some regret at the pain this conversation had caused, even if she was still confident it had been the right thing to do. "Well, that was the day I met Freya and she gave me the card. Then we spent the day planning out our trip and headed to meet you the day after. We also met Black Emerald that day as you know, he's the shit who sent the magic armor after us. And while fighting it, I'm sure you noticed that I tried to draw it's magic into myself to slow it down or weaken it. I thought I could redirect the magic into my own and because it's entirely a magical being, it'd make it easier to fight. Turns out doing so I pulled a curse that Black Diamond themselves has, into myself. So I saw a lot of people suffering and some really horrible things." She didn't feel the need to comment on how she'd broken down after seeing those. Or go into detail into what exactly she'd seen. "I didn't know I'd pulled the curse into myself, so we went into Myst and everything was fine. Apparently, the curse was dampened by Myst's magical prevention measures, so I didn't have any negative effects there. But when we came out, the reason Black Diamond wanted to talk to me was because she wanted to remove the curse from me. Said no one deserved to live with it, and she wouldn't wish it on anyone." Ellesandra cleared her throat, deciding to restart this part in more detail rather than the very high level summary she was giving before. Her goal was to give the basics, and let Amelia and Amara ask the questions that mattered to them since she knew they probably would anyways, but Star deserved to know more about this part. "Well, I stepped through the portal, and ended up in what looked like a classroom but with red swirling dust in the ceiling and out the windows. Black diamond is some powerful being close to deity level, and I admit I'm not a big fan of beings like that anymore. So when she told me to sit down I chose to be a little bit reckless, assuming she'd have just killed me if she wanted me dead, and chose to sit somewhere that would annoy her. She may have sent me falling for a few minutes and then impaled on a bunch of spikes for that." A glance was given to Star. There was true regret that, at how Star had apparently been able to feel that and how it had effected her. "I immediately appeared in the room again with no real injuries to my body, so I'm not sure if she actually killed me and brought me back, or if it was something in just my mind like a psychic thing, but I definitely still felt it like I'd been killed. Either way, I gave her space after that and she explained she's cursed, and I unintentionally drew some of the curse into myself. She wanted it back. We chatted about if I would be able to break her curse but I think the answer to that is a pretty solid no, and I'm not confident she'd let me if I could. The curse prevents her from dying so - she might be using that in her plan to war with the gods and destroy them, and all." Oh. She hadn't mentioned that before, had she? Well, she had now. "Anyways, she drew the curse from me and sent me back. And revealed her name is Valentina. I also got to see how she became cursed while she was drawing it from me but - well, I don't think that was an intended side effect and I'll refrain from sharing her personal details that have no matter to this conversation unless I have to." Ellesandra finished, taking a deep breath and turning to face them all. "Questions?"
Star Lumina	Star certainly had no qualms with sharing her personal details. Hard as they might be, and Ellesandra would certainly see the little wounds, the pinpricks of pain, at certain topics. Her mother being held captive, mainly. But it was an example of how Star dealt with things in that moment; she had been wounded in the moment, she had cried when she learned of it all...But now? She was okay. It wasn't hurting her anymore, not conceptually at least. It obviously still hurt because her mother was still captive, an active sort of pain, but if anything that just emboldened her to action rather than break her down to cry. Amelia had given a little smirk at the pointed look about not interrupting, but otherwise had a serious expression as she listened, one leg folded over the other to ensure her skirt didn't reveal anything immodest from her posture on the chair. Amara sat bolt straight on her chair, arms folded and just listening with an expression that showed empathy any time the story drifted to the rougher subjects. Not quite as obvious and compassionate as Star, of course. But as tough as Amara was as a fighter, she clearly had a softer heart. She was no Sia, that was certain, even if she could drill students just as well. Flashes of recognition showed on Amelia's face at certain points. The explanation of magic, the reason Ellesandra broke down...Everyone in attendance was listening close. Star in particular was mindful of Ellesandra's emotional state through it, knowing their pacing and hair were points of self-soothing for them that she'd seen before. Everyone...Needed a minute with all that. "I don't want you to feel bad about what you did, Ellesandra," said Star. "To be honest I...Didn't even know I could feel that sort of thing. It's all very new to me, too." She then looked at the others. "Er...To explain, the reason I got so upset out of nowhere in the field. I felt Ellesandra's death that she described. That's a large part of how auramancy works. Magical empathy is one of the core pillars of it. But I'm sure you also know that auras have a general understanding in arcana; your devotion aura, for example, Amara. It's just a product of your natural aura, something that is a part of you, an extension of your soul, burning with the divine energy that flows through you. And Amelia, I'm sure you're familiar with how many enchantments classify as 'auras' when they linger on someone and affect others near them. That's the same idea. Injecting arcane energy into an aura can make it produce the effects you're familiar with. That's another pillar of auramancy - the ability to manipulate another person's aura to produce effects. It takes time and you have to...Connect with someone, in a manner of speaking. Things like friendship and general closeness with another person make it easier over time to perform auramancies on others. Each person has a certain level of natural attunement with any other given person. Some people have a major resistance to my auramancy, others have a natural acceptance of it. And those natural qualities would be different if the auramancer was my mother, for example. So even if I had a naturally strong connection with either of you, my mother wouldn't necessarily have the same. That is all to say that just because I'm an auramancer doesn't mean it's always straight forward with others to use my magic. But, being close to someone, physically touching with things like putting my hand on them, and purposefully strengthening connections in mutual meditation, can strengthen that connection, either temporarily or permanently. The apex of that, where my aura can connect with someone else without inhibition, is a state called 'resonance'. Normally, resonance can take months, years even to build with someone. It's not required to make auramancy work effectively, but it does make it a lot stronger. My mom explained to me that she only wanted to be resonant with my, er, other mother, Robin. And she was, but Robin died before I was born. I could always see how that took a part of my mother, Aurora, with her. Not something I understood when I was younger but...Because auramancy is such a deeply personal form of magic, it's equally vulnerable to things like...People I care about getting hurt, or dying. There's a natural attenuation for auramancy to lead to strongly defensive and curative magic. Healing and abjuration come very naturally to me. But just the same, it seems that even if separated by planes or vast distances, that connection stays constant. We mentioned it briefly in the past but, Ellesandra and I are resonant. We were from the get-go, which, well...I've met a lot of people in my travels, and I've never been resonant with them from the start, nor did I ever build resonance with anyone else. All a bit of a long-winded explanation to help you understand why I broke down," she said, blushing a little, but keeping her emotions level throughout. Amara responded: "So, what happens when Ellesandra gets hurt? You mentioned it's a protective magic, and it's fortunate that it is able to bypass this...Resistance Ellesandra has. I've seen you heal her before, but you mentioned just outside that it's still harder for you to heal her," said Amara, met with a nod from Star. "There are methods I can use to heal with auramancy, but the only one I've mastered is called 'sympathetic healing'. It's a method of healing someone else, and it's made easier or harder by the strength of that connection I have with them. It's fairly effortless to do on Ellesandra for me. But the caveat is that while it does heal the other person, it does this by transferring the wounds onto me. Now, my magic is empowered by how well my aura can 'flow' through a given aura, and there's not any aura it can flow through better than itself, so healing myself takes substantially less mana. So in the process of transferring this wound, I'm able to heal it before it actually manifests on me. Even grievous wounds, life-threatening ones. I don't actually open wounds on myself from this, but...I do feel the pain from the wound for a while, as if I did suffer it. It fades over time, and I can speed that up with meditation. So even something like being stabbed through the gut, I could take from someone and be fine after a day or two at the most if I focus on it, longer if I let it happen passively. Of course, there's something to be said that being in excruciating pain makes it hard to meditate, but truthfully that's something my mother trained me to be able to do. It's a skill that's useful to auramancy, to be able to meditate and do what we call achieving 'purity of self' no matter what pain we feel. If that purity of self is ever broken, I can't use my auramancy, and I generally feel pretty awful. I can't get sick normally, but any time my purity of self breaks, it's like having a really awful flu." Star took a moment to breath here. "And, it's also important to know that, as much as it's not a tactic I encourage, if things ever do go wrong and someone close to me is in danger, that...Need...The strong desire to protect them, can push my auramancy into a sort of...Empowered state. Any time I'm in crisis, it's like a fount of mana explodes inside me, and while I never really am thinking too clearly in those moments, since I'm just acting on emotion at that point, I'm able to far exceed my normal limits. Not without probably passing out after the fact from exhaustion or something close to that...At the very least gives me a nasty nosebleed. But given who we're up against I...Figure it's probably going to happen at least a few times that we get into a crisis situation. If you see my eyes sort of...Brighten and go a solid colour, go ablaze with mana, just understand that's probably what's happening." Another breath. "Sorry. I know this is all complicated. Really I'd...Love someday to be able to explain it all more so it could be recorded in Myst, help out with the collection of knowledge. But the only way I can ever really understand anything enough to be confident in sealing it in formal knowledge is if it's something I fully understand. And there's still so much I don't know, so much more my mom had left to teach me." Amara held up a hand and shook her head. "No need to apologize. Really, what you've explained is more than enough. Now isn't the time to focus on whether or not the knowledge can be saved. Someday, it would be nice. But we'll just add that to the pile of other, more important reasons to save your mother, aye?" said Amara with a soft smile, earning a nod from Star, and a smile in turn. "Right," said Star in turn. "Shapeshifting apparently is one of those things you're still learning about, yeah?" asked Amelia, wearing a small smile. Not a joke, but something to lighten the mood a little. Star giggled softly, nodding again, then looked back to Ellesandra, along with the other two women. "Question for you, Ellesandra," began Amelia. "What's your high-level plan, then? We've seen that this...Valentina person can just decide to plunk us wherever they please if we try to teleport into Gurhal at least. They were able to throw a suit of armor at us that, if I didn't have Vaerix as my trump card, would have been a fight I would have sooner encouraged that we have an emergency retreat rather than fight. They are apparently approaching deity level strength. They have at least two more high-level officers," she said, not knowing that Ellesandra knew it was exactly three, and that all three had been present in the field, but one was invisible. "I can only assume that they are going to harass us, and while I'm not going to back down in the face of someone who clearly is out to do some awful things, I have to also be pragmatic about this. Even if the captain were to put out a call to the whole First Crusaders, and we certainly do make quite the mean fighting team all together, we still don't know the full capabilities of these assholes. Oh, and this curse apparently makes her immortal, so, joy, killing this Valentina woman is actually pointless even if we could. I'm invested in seeing this through at this point, because hell if I'm going to let you two run off and die and leave that on my conscience," a sentence that, when the Amelia attitude was removed, actually meant 'I have come to care about you two', even if she wasn't going to say it quite such a sappy way. "But we need to have a bigger plan in place. More than just how to navigate this behemoth plane without walking for months until you succumb to your advanced age," she said, cementing that apparently Ellesandra being old was the running joke, even though in reality Ellesandra was actually only a single year older than Amelia, and Amara was the oldest among them. "I wanna know what we're gonna do to actually beat these pricks. Because the way I see it, they won't have any trouble making this all difficult for us, and the closer we get to freeing their prisoner, the harder they're gonna fight back. And nothing will give me quite as much satisfaction as wiping that stupid, smug grin off that green haired freak's face."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra would feel bad about how it had caused pain for Star, no matter if Star wanted that or not. The regret was still there, even if it was easily pushed away and ignored while they continued on to discuss the rest of it. She'd stopped pacing as Star explained her magic, standing awkwardly for a moment but then moving to sit on the bed next to Star once it became obvious she wouldn't have to go into any more long explanations about things. Instead, she listened quietly as Star explained the connection they had, the resonance and how it was formed, as well as how her magic worked. She was glad Star did that, because honestly she wasn't sure exactly how to go about explaining it herself. She winced at the explanation of how being resonant with someone and then losing them took a part of them away, at least in Aurora. Was that what had been happening to Star when she thought that Ellesandra had 'died'? She crossed her arms, considering and wishing she'd thought to ask for hot cocoa if the tavern had it. Her nerves could really use it right now. Ellesandra wasn't normally a talker, or sharer, so sharing all of this was definitely out of her comfort zone. Not to mention that she had literally felt the pain of death less than 8 hours ago and was also wrestling with her emotions for Star, she wanted the crutch of a comfort item more than she normally did. She didn't say anything about it, shifting from crossed-arms to hands placed in her lap and squeezing together. At Amelia asking her a question, she turned her attention back to the woman and nodded. "Well, first of all, i can sense them. I don't know how I can sense them, but I could do so even before I fully signed on to travel with Star. Ever since that first dream Black Diamond visited me in. The captain, I could sense the shadow coming from him, and it was centered in the gem that was his heart. I can sense the same in all three of her lieutenants, and she'd shared with me in a dream that's all she had. Not that it isn't possible for her to have lied, but I think we'll only have to deal with three of them for now. Also, all three were there when we stepped out of the portal. Remember I said there's another behind us? Star can sense invisible people's aura, so she's covered in sensing this one, but I could tell because I could sense the shadow." Ellesandra glanced at Star, realizing only now that had been a detail she hadn't shared before. It hadn't been intentionally withheld, though. Just not something she'd deemed important at the time. "But well, we know they can't truly be wounded unless you stab them in the gem in their heart. I've been able to trace it in all three of them to ensure it is in their heart and not a different place for each one, when we were ambushed today. Well, at least the two I could see. So we won't waste attacks on stabbing them through the head like I did the first one, not knowing it wouldn't do anything." She paused, considering more. What would they do when fighting them? They were all obviously powerful, and Amelia was right that Valentina was immortal while cursed. "I somehow doubt we'll have to fight Valentina directly, so her being immortal isn't a factor hopefully. And if we do, well. Just let me touch her necklace and prevent her from killing me while I do. I can draw the curse into myself so we can kill her. Not ideal, but possible if it's absolutely necessary." Ellesandra was very pointedly NOT looking at Star when she said this. She knew damn well Star wouldn't allow that, but she felt like it was a necessary plan to share just in case. "The rest of them, I'm truly unsure. We can practice fighting together so we have different battle plans, but we don't truly know the powers of each of them. I suspect the armored knight we fought wasn't even directly the Black Emeralds - green haired freak" She clarified for Amelia. "creation. Unless they're all just aspects of Valentina herself, it would have needed to be her magic that passed the curse on to me. So, we're unsure what any of them can actually do in a fight, themselves."
Star Lumina	"You can?" asked Star when Ellesandra mentioned they could sense the shadows. New information, for certain. She blinked, considering this. "I wonder why that is," she said more to herself. Was it just a product of how Ellesandra's magic worked? Seemed an awfully specific side effect. Amelia briefly recalled the instruction that there was another behind, and while she hadn't been sure that had been another of these 'lieutenants', that did clarify it, so she nodded. "Stab in the heart. Got it. I'm sure if we ask nicely they'll stand still while we do so," said Amara with a chuckle, hoping a little lighter tone could help keep things smooth. As if it was so simple. Then when Ellesandra spoke about taking the curse, Star's head violently whipped towards them. Ellesandra didn't need to look at Star to feel the disapproval from her. It legitimately was strong enough that Ellesandra could quite seriously feel it from their presence. Their level of resonance made stronger emotions flow more freely between them, and the close proximity and strength of emotion made it tangible for the knight. It wasn't nearly as strong for them as Star felt it, but to feel it at all made Star's stance clear. No. She understood that in an emergency, desperate measures were sometimes needed. But that wasn't okay in her books. She didn't say anything, but, well, the slightly awkward looks from Amara and Amelia as they saw the head turn fast enough to lash someone with those pretty white locks told the story. Yeah. They noticed. "Well," began Amelia again. "Sounds like we can expect to fight more of those. If not those armor suits, then more of her creations. Goodie gumdrops." She sighed through her nose. What a thing to get involved in. "So what do you suggest as the path forward? Obviously, next steps are to follow this lead to see about securing an airship. Then going to Snowhaven. And if by the grace of luck we manage that without complication, then what? I know it'll depend on what we find I suppose. But I'd feel a lot better if we started thinking two or three or four steps ahead rather than just one. Sure as the hells sounds like our enemy is doing that."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra had no idea why she could feel the shadow she just assumed it was something in regards to how Valentina was in her dreams. At the comment about them standing still, Ellesandra smiled to Amelia. "Just cast hold person better." The tease back was obvious, humor in regards to how hard stabbing them in the heart would actually be. Or just somehow destroying the heart - didn't have to be stabbing. With Star's OBVIOUS disapproval, Ellesandra kept her gaze firmly away from Star's own. She knew that wasn't an option Star would accept, which - "Actually, Star. If we do have to face Valentina, you are absolutely not allowed on the field during that. Not because I'm just being protective, but Valie-bitch actively said an auramancer looking at her while she had the curse would go insane. And I know it's not just looking that would do something to you, you can still sense it." There was an unspoken implication that if, for some reason, Ellesandra had to pull the curse into herself then she would be able to be near Star, as well. "That's very important, Star. The curse involves feeling the suffering of every living person. You can not be near it." She'd heard what Amelia had said, the suggestion to figure out next steps after getting to Snowhaven, but Ellesandra wanted to wait until Star met her eyes and affirmed her understanding. She wasn't joking about this, and she turned a fully serious face onto Star with the look of ' you don't really have a choice in this.'
Star Lumina	Star was taken aback by the serious shift, and knowing the details of the curse. Amelia and Amara, too, knit their brows. They needed a moment to make sure they heard that correctly. Star, as well, had to consider that. Yes, if she was exposed to that, she could see how it would break her. That Valentina wasn't also just some comatose vegetable because of it didn't track for her. How could anyone bear that? She could think on that later, for the moment, she had to face Ellesandra. She saw the serious look. Her not being there was reasonable, given the evidence. That much didn't meet any resistance, so was met with a soft nod. "I understand. I don't know that I could run from someone like that but...If I have any choice in the matter, I'm not going to be reckless in the face of a curse that powerful." An answer that hopefully set Ellesandra at ease. Star didn't have a death wish, and she held firm on HER side of the promise of 'no death'. "...But that doesn't mean you have any business interacting with that curse, either. There'll be another way."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded. She wasn't sure how either, shaking her head. "Trust me, the small taste of it I got after drawing it into myself was enough to make me not want to, Star." Just because she didn't want to, didn't mean she wouldn't be willing to if she had to. "As a note, the curse is what broke my sword. I tried stabbing her gem and using the curse to power the sword enough to break through the curse. Didn't really, well. Work." Ellesandra looked sheepish. "I'm not sure if Valentina shattered my rapier to stop me or if the curse shattered it, but either way. For Valentina's part, she protected me form the shards of my own sword though, for some reason." Ellesandra hadn't considered why, she had no real idea. Valentina didn't seem to want her dead, but she also did if Ellesandra continued with Star. More like didn't actively want to kill her but would if she needed to? She shrugged. A hand reached out and lightly patted Star's thigh. Reassurance at Star not getting near the curse had helped ease the sudden worry that had come up, and she didn't let her touch linger for long before she'd turned back to Amelia. "Anyways, I'm not sure. We get to Snowhaven, and search for clues as to where Star's mother was taken. We know she was taken by one of Valentina's groups, so we're likely to have to fight one of the lieutenants to free her. And Valentina will likely know, since she can sense everyone's suffering and spy on them through that." Oh, shit. That was another thing she didn't mention. "So, we look for clues there, and we can probably ask about the Cult of Faust location on our way. They might be related, since Sapphire confirmed they were working together with Valentina. That or asking about general banditry and the like. If we can't find anything either through information or at Snowhaven, then perhaps we turn to finding someone with magic who might be able to perform a scry for us. Assuming neither of you can?" She asked, glancing between Star and Amelia.
Star Lumina	"Oh, is that all?" said Amelia, looking exhausted at this point. She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Anything else in your 'by the way' pile of realm-shattering revelations you'd like to share while you're at it? What does that even mean? Spy on us through suffering? So what, every time I get a papercut she's able to spy on me? Every time I'm having a shitty morning? Urrgghgh," said Amelia, huffing after her groan in case her frustration wasn't apparent enough. "Gods above this just keeps getting better the more I learn of it," she muttered to herself, then looked at Ellesandra. "Of course I can scry. Who do you think you're talking to?" she said, giving a pouty look. "Something that I'm realistically only gonna have one shot at per day, and I don't exactly carry a super expensive focus for that sort of magic in my back pocket, but if you think it'll be useful, I can ask my captain next time I see her if the Followers might loan out one of their suitably tailored crystal balls for me to carry with me," she said, then looked dryly at Amara, who just gave them a look that was all too used to their sarcasm in return. "And what the hell is up with this Cult of Faust anyway? Who is Faust, and why do they have a cult? And why is that cult helping this cursed bitch?"
Ellesandra	Ellesandra felt like Amelia was truly speaking for the whole group with all of this. "I'm not quite sure how specific it gets, but I know she knows everything about my past. Which has not been told to anyone but Star, and she doesn't even know all of it. Valentina knows because when I suffered, apparently she did too." She shrugged. "So if you really wanna make her suffer, just stab yourself in foot every morning and call her a bitch, I guess." Ellesandra was obviously not being serious. She shook her head. "I'm not sure how much 'spying' she gets from it, considering she's also suffering for a thousand other people at the same time I'm sure, but she'll probably know stuff about all of us that we haven't shared with anyone." Well, except Star because Star was an open book, but still. "And I'll let Star explain the cult of faust, she probably knows more about them than I do?" Ellesandra asked more than said, looking at Star. "They are the cult that was in your story, no?"
Star Lumina	Amelia looked briefly amused by the petty comment. A successful distraction from the rest of it. Star had sympathy - because of course she did - for the frustrations on display. It certainly had exploded well beyond what she thought it would. She just...Wanted to find her mom. That was it. Why did it have to be this complicated? "Safe to say that, depending on the sensitivity of it, nothing we do will be secret. Best to operate on that assumption and not rely on being clandestine," said Amara. Star gently nodded to Ellesandra passing the explanation to her. "Not exactly, but, sorta, I guess. It was never called the Cult of Faust in the stories. But in Gurhal, everyone learns of an ancient war that happened here. You can ask pretty much anyone about it and they'll remember at least part of the story, I'm sure. Some might also make reference to a concept they call 'the old suffering', which is a reference back to this war. To make a very long story short, well...There was an exceptionally evil man who rose to power in Gurhal some thousand years ago. Some evidence from ancient ruins show that Gurhal used to be a very highly advanced place prior to this war, most of which survived in Hotenz city, where there was the historic last stand of the people of Gurhal. The war was incited by and led on the side of destruction by the man, Faust. He often is referred to as the Grand Magician in this context, for he was an archmagi." This fact evoked a flick of the ears from Amelia. That word, archmagi, seemed to pique her interest specifically, but she continued to listen quietly. "The people who followed him collectively were known as the Dark Curtain. And while I'm sure it was a cult, it didn't go by that plain title. He tried and nearly succeeded in destroying all of Gurhal, promising an...Ascension of the species to godhood, to surpass even the feats of Netheril. As the story goes, the gods sent their strongest warrior, Silent Purity, to slay Faust when Gurhal was in its darkest hour. Silent Purity was what was called a Seraph. Which is just the feminine term for what most scholars call Solars, which is considered the masculine term. I know that might deviate from typical nomenclature, so just know they mean the same thing in terms of how powerful they were. There's a lot of speculative facts that I won't get into, things people disagree on with this old history. But, 'the old suffering' refers to a sort of...Collective agreement from all people in Gurhal. A promise that we must all act to prevent us from feeling that suffering again, from falling to the depths of darkness the plane once experienced. And while I've been away from Gurhal for a long time now, I can only imagine that this Cult of Faust has read into the very obviously horrible things that once happened, took the understanding of the old suffering, and perverted it to turn Faust into a martyr or something, probably trying to bring about another dark age. Though just knowing what I know about Gurhal, they will have to be extremely sneaky sorts. No sensible, reasonable person will ever associate Faust with anything good, and they'd more than likely be hunted by anyone with a decent moral compass if they truly are trying to emulate the destruction of the past."
Ellesandra	Ellesandra nodded to Amara. "So when you two make out when we aren't looking, make sure to remember that Valentina can see that." Ellesandra intentionally inserted the most off the wall thing she could think of to try to alleviate the potential depression this topic could bring up. her goal was to make Amelia - and maybe Amara? - splutter in outrage or something, just smiling a shit eating grin at the two of them. She had also perfectly timed it to try to line up with when she'd passed the baton to Star to speak, since she thought they'd be a little less likely to interrupt Star's explanation than they would if Ellesandra had been the one talking. With the conclusion of Star's rehash of Faust, she shook her head. "More powerful arch beings. Lets just hope our luck doesn't keep up and this Faust isn't resurrected or something and we have to fight him off too. I'm strong against magic users but archmages might be out of my league even still." That really did seem to be the way the damn adventure seemed to be going lately. If something bad could happen to get in their way, it did. She looked back to Amelia and Amara, serious compared to her previous statement. "It's not too late for you two to back out, if you want to." The offer felt needed, since this had grown to much larger proportions than either of them had known originally.
Star Lumina	Amara just quietly closed her eyes and shook her head at the make out comment. Amelia very obviously rolled her eyes. Was there something between the two of them? They weren't giving signals that there was, but they could be hiding it. Star probably knew, but she also wouldn't be divulging that even if asked. When the offer to back out came up, Amelia straightened her posture and folded her arms again, having been slightly leaning forward on her crossed legs for a moment. "What, just head on back to Myst to relax and read, say good luck, try not to die, which you probably will?" Amelia scoffed. "I already said you're not leaving your death on my conscience, so you're stuck with me now. Should have thought about that before bringing us along and explaining all this. You had your chance to be rid of me," she said, full of huffy attitude. Amara moved a hand to plant softly on top of Amelia's head, flattening their ears gently and rubbing back and forth. "What Amelia is trying to say is that the evidence of how dire this all is is cause for greater support, not less. Truly, if we find ourselves outclassed, it may even be worth seeking support in Myst. If we have a way to move around the realm more swiftly, if this airship plan pans out, there are powerful fighters and mages in Myst who are prepared to lay their lives on the line for what is right. Professor Yami in particular, I recall him speaking about something he did years ago, saving this young feline woman from a kidnapping and stood against exceptionally fierce resistance in doing so; it stuck with me because he spoke of how he and the allies he brought with him were like a force of nature, an exceptionally strong paladin, an assassin, a mighty fighter, he, the wizard. And yet, the enemy summoned a legion from the hells to stand against them and he ended up snapping his staff over his knee to perform a retributive blast. That selflessness made it quite the story to me, as it was a coin toss as to whether he would have been destroyed alongside the enemy. What was the name of that woman...So...Soria, no...Sophia! Yes, that was the name," said Amara, and what was a small anecdote to her evoked a bright signal of recognition in Star. "Sophia? Is that what happened to her?" she asked, looking briefly upset by this. "Goodness...I knew I should have accompanied her..." Amara was surprised to hear that Star somehow knew this, but it did serve to corroborate the story as more than just the professor boasting. Unexpected. "...Hm. Small worlds, I suppose. But, well...Given all that you have said, Ellesandra, and Star...It's my belief we should seek allies wherever we go. We never know whose talents might be needed, and with enemies like the one's who stand against us...It ought not be ruled out that our actions might incite wider conflict."
