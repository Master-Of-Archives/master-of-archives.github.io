<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Through Ellesandra's travels they had doubtlessly encountered many faces good and bad; for them to hear the commotion of banditry in progress might be as familiar as the pleasant birdsong of a morning in these forested lands. "Oi! Get back here, girly! We ain't done wit'cha yet!" came the gruff voice of one man, dulled through the trees. Another voice cackled alongside the first. "Kekekeh, what'ssamatter? We ain't gonna hurt'cha, s'long as ya giz all your coin!" Then, a third voice. A womanly yelp. It was close by, but difficult to see through the tree-line. The main road did not have a clear path, so dashing through the underbrush was the most direct route. No other people could be seen along the road as it stretched north-south; the yelp of a woman in peril came from the east. Another voice then echoed. Male, like the other gruff ones: "A-ta-ta-ta, easy, girlie, ain't getting away that easy! We got'cha now, so why dun'ya give up nice and easy. We'll also be takin' that pretty silk dress o' yours, o'course.."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was aimless. She was wandering, following road to town then another road to another town. Usually she picked up a job on the way, but no one in particular was travelling this way so this time, she was alone. Armor plated feet made that particular metallic noise upon each step down the dirt path, her eyes ahead and taking in the sights of the roads. Might as well enjoy the environment on her trip, right? That was, until she heard voices off in the distance, in the trees to the side of the road. Ellesandra came up to a stop, head tilting and listening. The voice of a few men, seeming to be trying to encourage someone to give them coin filtered through the trees. Despite this, Ellesandra didn't start moving, not into the sound of a womanly yelp came out. Ellesandra's left hand moved to rest on the rapier hilt on her right hip, taking a few steps forwards towards the trees and the underbrush. A glance was given down both directions of the road, and the other side of the road behind her; a cursory scan to ensure that this wasn't some ploy to trap her or get her surrounded or distracted. Not that anyone had reason to target her, but it wasn't unheard of for bandits to use the idea of a damsel in distress to trap someone else, too. Confirming that there was no immediate danger behind her, she eyed the right places to step and quickly moved through the underbrush, taking long strides that skipped as much ground as possible with intentionally placed steps to ensure that she didn't step on any traps that may have been left and hidden within the obscured brush. She ignored the pricks of foliage that brushed against her, stepping through into the small clearing that the bandits, and the woman, was. At least three men, and then the apparent damsel. Ellesandra didn't look particularly imposing, height wise. She was short at 5'1, though wearing an ornate looking white breastplate with carvings and designs on it, abnormal for someone to wear if they ever expected to get hit in it. A plate skirt, matched this, going down to mid thigh where it met long, gauntleted boots to protect the remainder of her legs. Black tights were worn beneath, both to cover the skin open to the air and prevent the metal from resting against it directly. Long, white hair was currently hanging down to her mid back, natural waves and curls in it. Typically if she were expecting a fight it would be worn up in a ponytail, though she hadn't been about to stop to put it up before stepping in. Blue eyes stood out from a pale skinned face, quickly taking in the situation. She did not immediately draw her blade, but would take a few steps to circle the situation, steps that would take her closer to the woman, but not quite in-between them yet. "Gentlemen, any chance I can persuade you to depart with your lives?" Words were spoken coldly, and straight to the point, with a stoic face that took years of practice to master. She looked almost bored, as if she didn't truly care about the outcome of this encounter. Her eyes reflected the dead feelings inside of her, but there were so many feelings that weren't being shown. Guilt was overwhelming, one that almost encompassed the rest of them and made them hard to feel. The guilt alone was pressing down the sadness, grief, depression. The only feeling that competed with the guilt was anger, though this was partially directed at herself so the anger and guilt blended together in many aspects. Rising up to the surface, the caution and suspicion at her current predicament, paranoia that this was a trap, and also irritation at these bandits for even making this an issue if it were a real situation. Preying on a lone traveler was weak and cowardly, and the irritation was making itself known.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Checking their surroundings, Ellesandra found nothing but empty road and a midday horizon greeting them in both directions. Unless the stray squirrel they spied on the tree behind them was secretly an evil-doer posing as a woodland critter, there was no trap to be found. Indeed, as they stepped through the underbrush, they came to find the situation exactly as it would be expected as they stepped into a clearing amidst the trees that sported trodden earth and patchy grass. Three bandits, each sporting red bandanas, scruffy beards, and less-than-pristine scimitars that had bitten the wood of ship decks as much as they had their pray. Pirates, it seemed, standing at various heights hovering around six feet, and all looking decently conditioned by their pirate lifestyle. Striped white and red sea-fairing shirts with suspender-bearing pants that were tattered and torn from the life at sea. A nearby port town to the north-east explained their presence here, though that remained a town yet to be visited by the knight. The three of them turned to look at the knightly woman when they arrived. They stood in a triangular formation, surrounding another woman. This woman looked entirely out of place among these ruffians, which was likely what led to this situation in the first place. A bit taller than Ellesandra at five-five. Long, flowing white hair pure as an untrodden snowfall. Bright, vibrant blue eyes that were as if the sky and the sea brought to bear their vastness to express the gentle soul of the woman they belonged to. Almost mesmerizing in their striking beauty, or they might be if not for the distracting red wound on the woman's cheek. A gash, likely from one of the pirate blades. It looks to have clotted, but the red streaks down her cheek were fresh and slowly drying. Further evidence of this wound could be seen on Star's dress. A bright, beautiful white and light-blue garment with exuberant frills and feathery adornments along the rim of its brassiere, with sheer fabric visible below the flowy skirt. A dress fit for a princess, even if Star was anything but. Star, despite being surrounded by these evil-doers, did not look exceptionally fearful. Adrenaline was clearly working through her. But it was not the face of an entirely helpless damsel. Just a woman who, even if they did know how to fight, was still very much in danger. The three pirates turned to the knight, the two that were facing Star turned their backs to her to face Ellesandra. The other was already facing them. "Ey? What's this, little lady? C'mon, now, no need for you t' get mixed up in all 'is, then, is there? Move along, we's just seeing to escortin' this 'ere lass to our, ah, protective custody, yeah?" said the first pirate, wearing a grin that showcased some dreadfully rotten and cavitated teeth. "Yeah," chimed in the second. "We'd uh, 'ate to have ta', you know...Get'cha all mixed up in this 'ere...Perfectly legal and legitimate transaction, eh?" he said, wearing a shit-eating grin for his attempt at deception. Star met eyes with Ellesandra when they observed her; she could see the crushing, overwhelming guilt upon them, as well as the anger boiling just under their calm exterior. Star dare not escalate the situation by striking, but...There was a calm readiness in her eyes. A silent signal that she would follow their lead. Star very obviously also did not have a weapon, so one might wonder just what she might have up her sleeve. If she had sleeves, at least. She did not.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra eyed the men who seemed to have ignored that she was well armored and dressed. She carried herself with a practiced, cautious ease. If these men were smart, they would have recognized that she was no mere traveler who just happened to be armed. She'd seen combat; plenty of it. When Ellesandra's eyes met that of the woman, and saw the blood there and along a gown, the irritation turned quickly into anger. It was too similar, seeing this woman on her knees, injured and surrounded by enemies. Her eyes had widened slightly when she looked at the woman, and saw her previous charge, instead. Not literally, of course, but the similarities were enough that her guilt ridden mind easily made a connection, and it took a moment of blinking her image away to reinstate the reality of their current situation. This woman wasn't her Princess, but it did not matter. She had been injured, and Ellesandra was not going to listen to these men's flimsy explanations. With a glance back at the nearest man, her left hand drew her rapier quickly. Her right raised and a light yellow light poured out of it, quickly covering her own body in an enchantment. There were no words spoken for the magic, though it became obvious why she didn't utilize a shield or anything with her rapier, as her right hand had drawn an invisible sigil in the air as the spell took form. Haste, a low powered one currently as these pirates didn't seem like they needed the full extent of the spell and the stronger it was, the bigger the toll it would take on Ellesandra's body. Just enough of a boost to ensure that as she struck, the pirates wouldn't be able to get to their captive. The captive woman looked plenty ready to fight back herself, but Ellesandra wasn't going to risk her own attack causing them to decide to kill the woman instead. With the speed that seemed supernatural to any normal warrior or bandit, her rapier shot out straight for the first man's throat. Ellesandra didn't hold back the killing blow, but whether or not it struck home the rest of her body was moving - grabbing his shirt and hauling him to the side as she stepped in to stand closer to the woman. Close enough that she could defend her if any of the men decided to step in towards her, but wanting to give her enough space to do whatever she had in mind; Ellesandra knew better than to step in between someone about to cast magic or make their own attack and accidentally ruin it or cause them to injure themselves.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirates shifted their stances when the other's weapon was drawn. A fight was inevitable, it seemed. And it was the arrogance of the outlaws that made them all too ill-prepared for what, or rather who, was about to strike them. The magic gave them pause, striking a mild fear into them. But one pirate saw fit to close the distance to try and stop the spell before Ellesandra could weave it. His reaction too slow, the distance too great, and his lifetime of fighting other unskilled pirates did not prepare him for the lethal precision Ellesandra employed. His sword was high, neck exposed as he charged with a battlecry at the knight. His life ended nigh instantly as Ellesandra's rapier pierced his neck, bulging his eyes as his hands grasped with futility at the wound and choked gurgles served as his final words before his lifeless body was discarded, leaving Ellesandra's rapier dripping with his crimson essence. The other two pirates remained too slow to react as Ellesandra took position near Star. Star, then, took the initiative to secure this fight for her knightly protector; she had been swelling magic within her chest while the conversation went on. Time enough for her to be ready upon a hair trigger to do what she planned. Her plan? She shot up to her feet beside Ellesandra, arms thrusting out to either side. A bright blue aura enveloped her as, in that split second of her shooting up, mana exploded outwards from her in the form of a blinding, brilliant light. As bright as the sun, yet Ellesandra would not find the light painful to their eyes. Instead, it was soft. Soothing. A residual white mist lingered around Star and spread out a handful of meters from her to make a swiftly dissipating fog in the aftermath of the spell; breathing deep within this mist would bring with it an emboldening, restorative sensation within Ellesandra, firmly suggesting Star to be the sort of magic user that focused on support and healing as the empowering mist filled Ellesandra's lungs. And, of course, while it empowered Ellesandra? The two remaining pirates were sent reeling back, free hands clutching palms over their eyes as they screamed in agony and blood poured out between their fingers over their eyes. Further evidence that the effect of the blinding flash was selective, given that to the knight it was little more strenuous than walking out into a sunny afternoon field. Wild, aimless swings of their scimitars found nothing as they tried to fight off the knight they knew was...Somewhere near them, ready to end them. Their blindness might be temporary, but given it was on the order of days it truly seemed Ellesandra would hardly have needed to use any magic at all to fell these fools. Doubly so with an ally like Star, though it stood to reason that it was only thanks to Ellesandra's distraction that Star could produce such magic, else she likely would not have ended up trapped in the first place.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had guessed the woman would be using magic of some kind, but she had not expected a brilliant light to appear out of nowhere. Our of instinct, Ellesandra turned her head away from the light and readjusted her position so that she was partially facing the woman, unsure if the woman was fully on her side or not. Still, the light wasn't actually painful to her eyes - something she didn't realize until a moment later - and instead it seemed...soothing. Energizing, really. Yet when she looked up to the pirates, it had obviously hit them differently, unpleasantly based on them seeming to be blinded. The caution and surprise almost filled her emotions, until it was roughly pushed down. Ellesandra could take time later to process what just happened and ask the woman about it. Right now, she was going to take advantage of the situation given. With the two men blinded and swinging their scimitars wildly, it was easy for Ellesandra to step up into range of them and avoid their aimless swings, her still enhanced speed being used to provide them both with a quick end. She could have kept them alive, but the risk of them doing something like this to someone else was too high. So, each of them received the same treatment the first one did; her blade straight through the center of their throat, pulled slightly to the side to ensure it cut into the artery. A quick kill, both depriving of oxygen and a quick bleed out. Not immediate, but close enough. Ellesandra waved her right hand and the haste spell ended on herself even as she turned to look at the woman, blade still drawn. The lethargy from the spell didn't hit as hard this time, considering the restorative magic that had surrounded her from the mage. Not to mention, even as the haste spell ended she could feel the energy from the mage's spell flowing into her in a way the mage probably hadn't expected; the mana of it itself replacing that which Ellesandra had used for her own spell. Ellesandra flicked the tip of her rapier to the side to get rid of most of the blood on it, eyes still on the apparent 'damsel'. She reached back, slipping her hand into a pocket on her bag and pulling out a dirty cloth rag and cleaning the rest of the blood off of the blade, but not speaking. She wanted to see how the woman responded to the men having been killed; she wasn't sure if she would need to defend herself from the mage or not.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The two pirates stood no chance. They had been debilitated. Mercy was an option, but none had shown any degree of remorse in what they were about to do. It was very likely indeed that they would be chasing another to steal from them before long, had they not met their ends. The grass and dirt below was now spattered with sprays and pools of blood. The mana that lingered in the air from Star's spell did very much to soothe and restore the knight before her. With all done, Star's reaction shifted from one of survival, of alert, adrenaline-widened eyes, to...Tears. She slid her arms around her own torso to give herself a self-hug. She bent forward slightly, head slightly hung as she bit her lower lip to try and fight back tears. Small trembles were visible in her frame. Eyes were shut tight. She tried to stifle her sniffles and choked, high-pitched sobs to some degree of success, but whatever was troubling her was still clearly too much for her to bear. Was it just shock? It certainly didn't seem like the first time she'd been in such a situation. So it did beg the question of what could produce such visceral and obvious sorrow in the woman.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra finished cleaning her rapier, eyes still on the woman now...crying. She wasn't quite sure how to approach or make the woman feel better; comforting a stranger was both not something she was comfortable with, or good at. Not to mention, suspicion was still heavily apparent. This could still very well be a trap, a way to ease her into thinking the woman was harmless. After that magic, Ellesandra wasn't going to let her guard down around the woman, at least not entirely. Sliding the rapier back into it's sheath, she stepped back to drag the men to the side and out of sight of the woman at least, since the death of others was likely to be a traumatizing factor if this woman hadn't seen death before. Staring at their dead bodies wouldn't help. It wasn't until after they were moved to the side that Ellesandra stepped back up towards the woman, and spoke. "You're safe now, miss. Did they injure you badly, anywhere?" There had been blood on the woman, though Ellesandra hadn't been able to get a good enough read on how injured she might have been. "I have some medical supplies in my pack, if you need them, but it also seems like you may be able to take care of the injuries via magic if that's easier for you?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had been quietly seeking her center while the knightly woman saw to putting the bodies out of the way in the nearby bushes. The vultures would certainly be along in the days to come if nobody found the corpses to deal with them. Nearby townsfolk would be unlikely to care enough to give these lawless bandits any proper rites. As Star cried, a soft blue aura slowly came over her. It was difficult to discern what the aura signified, but it was similar to the one she had when she attacked prior. Except...It swiftly shifted from its usual azure colour to a tumultuous mix of darker blues, reds, and purples. The colours certainly seemed to hold some sort of meaning, but...To an untrained eye it was little more than just what it was - a multicoloured aura. But as the bodies were tended to, as Star was given time, the colours slowly returned to a steady, azure blue. This coincided with Star's sobs and tears subsiding quite directly, to the point that when the aura was again one uniform colour, she had returned to steady breaths. She wiped at her eyes, taking measured breaths through her mouth to keep herself steady, then looked at Ellesandra when they spoke to her. She managed a half-smile and a nod at the notion of being safe, then a shake of the head at the question of being injured badly. "Just caught my cheek with their blade," she said, finally speaking. She had a gentle voice. Feminine and sweet, though still very subtly shaken. "That's very kind of you to offer. I can handle this small wound myself, though, you're right," she said, then moved one hand up to her own cheek. The tips of her fingers touched the wound, briefly glowing with soft white light once touching the wound. A few seconds of this passed, and when her fingers then removed again from the wound, it had ceased to be, leaving the skin unblemished and without so much as a mark to speak of. The streaks of red, the reminder of where the wound once was, remained, however. There was little sense wasting mana on what a wet cloth could accomplish, in her mind. She then moved her hands to her dress skirt, in all its feathery frills, and pinched either side with either hand to lift as she bowed in a pleasant curtsy to Ellesandra. "Thank you, as well, for coming to my aide. My name is Star Lumina. I typically travel with someone else who acts as my guardian, but..." She raised from the curtsy, then looked away from the other woman as discomfort overtook her face. "They are, erm...Indisposed...For the foreseeable future. I must admit I may have grown too comfortable with the safety that guardianship had afforded me, and thus complacent about how dangerous the realms can be." She returned her gaze to Ellesandra, a tiny blush coming over her cheeks at her honest admission. Despite having clearly powerful magic, she was, without a doubt, out of her depth.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had eyed the magical aura around Star cautiously, but hadn't made a move to stop whatever it was. When she watched the woman seem to gather herself and heard the sweet, feminine voice there was a momentary gut wrenching flashback. Guilt, pain, and grief hit her once again, hard enough that she actively took a step back from Star. Her jaw clenched and she fought it down, reminded herself that this was not the same. This woman - Star, she'd called herself - was not dying. If anything, she was more just traumatized by the experience, most likely. Taking a deep breath to help center her own emotions, Ellesandra nodded.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star noticed the reaction. She had noticed the distrust initially. She noticed it all. She couldn't understand the cause, only that her voice, something about her words, had caused a reaction. The shift of Elesandra's aura, the sudden pulse of heavy matte greys that bore down on them like a boulder. It evoked a sympathetic expression, though such expression would not give away that she could see more than the knight knew she could. "...I might have been able to, I just..." she blushed again, hands folded before her as she looked at the ground before her in...Shame? "I hesitated. Even though those men would have hurt me, I had hoped to get away without causing them harm." She gently shook her head with a sad chuckle. "I must sound pathetic," she said, looking back up to Ellesandra. "I could never ask to burden you with my protection, Miss Rhinelander. But I must...Also concede that it would be a great boon to me." She then pointed past Ellesandra, to the north-east. "...I was heading to Cloverport, just an hour's walk north-east from here, when these pirates intercepted me on the road. The main road just west of here will lead there. Though, erm...That is just a single stop in my journey." She lowered her arm, then took a deep breath and looked at Ellesandra more directly again. "...Perhaps it is foolhardy of me, but...The journey I am undertaking is one that I cannot abandon, no matter the perils I may face. So...Whatever aide you offer to me, I will only be able to selfishly accept." Some guilt, an emotion Ellesandra clearly knew well, overtook Star at that admission. A bold, assertive claim; for better or worse, she would not give up on whatever this quest of hers was.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The woman seemed to blush a lot. Was that attraction, or embarrassment? Ellesandra would assume the latter. Crossing her arms, she stood with her feet wide and looking up slightly at the woman, head tilted to the side. Her eyes were narrowed in what looked like a suspicious gaze, though the suspicion was much lower than it had been when she first encountered the pirates and Star. "I am not sorry for killing them, though I am sorry if my doing so caused you distress, Miss Lumina." The fact Star had hesitated because she hadn't wanted to kill the men was foolish, but Ellesandra fully understood that some people just didn't have it in them - especially some soft mages, like this woman seemed to be. Ellesandra had never seen magic like Star's, but that wasn't surprising; there were many kinds of magic in the world. After Star had commented on her current destination, and implied that it was only one stop on the journey, Ellesandra frowned. "First of all, it is not pathetic to require or admit you need help." A lesson that Ellesandra herself could learn from, but it was easier to give advice than follow it. "Foolish to try not to harm them. Even should you have succeeded in escaping, you would have simply left their next victim to it instead, but that would not have been your fault; only theirs." They turned to look in the direction Star had pointed, north-east, then back to her. "I will accompany you to Cloverport should you have my company, Miss Lumina. From there, I am open to be hired, or you may find another guard to hire on your journey should you prefer it. I would not recommend continuing whatever journey you are on alone."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently shook her head at the notion that the killing distressed her. "You have nothing to apologize for, truly," she said, then lowered her head as the brief lecture took place. Her face was that of a woman who understood all that Ellesandra said, but held a heart that stubbornly resisted the wisdom on offer. "You speak the truth. I know that fools who speak only in violence and refuse to hear reason must be spoken to with equal violence." She sighed, moving one hand to rub at her cheek. Understanding the truth was clearly no problem for her. Acting on it? Well, the intuition that some didn't have it in them was surely only reinforced by her reaction. She reset her posture and nodded to Ellesandra. "I...Am not exactly flush with coin. Hardly able to afford a brilliant knight as yourself, but...I appreciate your kindness in escorting me at least that far." She smiled. A quiet fear lingered behind her smile for what the future would bring, but her thankfulness was clear. Indeed, it was...Remarkably easy to discern Star's feelings at just a glance. To say she wore her heart on her sleeve didn't cut it - she held her heart out in both hands for all to see clearly, plainly, without needing to read deeper. Be it happiness, embarrassment, anger, sadness...Her face, her body language, was all unusually animated to the point that this woman had zero hope of ever hiding her true feelings from anyone who paid attention. A grinning, silver-tongued rogue she most certainly was not; such an image was her absolute antithesis.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra huffed softly, closing her eyes and then letting out a resigned sigh. She wouldn't say it, or offer it yet, but the idea of continuing with Star had already come into her head. Could she let this woman go off on her own for whatever misadventure and stubborn ideas she had in mind? It'd be all but letting her die, and it wasn't as if Ellesandra had anywhere else in specific to be. Still, she wasn't going to make that offer now; perhaps after seeing Star to the next town, and getting a better understanding of her and potentially her goal. Wiping her hands off in front of her, a physical attempt to wipe off the thought of killing those men and shrug it off, Ellesandra nodded towards the road. "Well, unless you need anything else here, we might as well get onto the road, Miss Lumina." Ellesandra would motion with a hand for Star to take the lead. "I will be right behind you and will ensure no one else might be around waiting for these three to return." It was possible; if these weren't their own small band of bandits they might have come from some local group that would be looking if they didn't return quickly. Ellesandra still had a stoic, cold look on their face, having not smiled once during their interaction. If anything, she looked tired - though that certainly wasn't a physical exhaustion.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently nodded to the notion that they should leave. She moved back the way she was being chased. Not a fully trodden road, but a wilderness path that had seen some foot traffic regularly enough to stomp down the underbrush to easily passed terrain existed. Nature-walkers likely made frequent passage. The walk along it wasn't terribly long, some ten minutes before they were back on the road properly. No other pirates could be seen passing or coming up behind them, though given the proximity to Cloverport, Ellesandra's vigilance wasn't unwarranted. Star allowed Ellesandra to take either the lead, the side, or behind her, whichever they felt most appropriate for escort. The town of Cloverport was vaguely visible on the horizon; a port-side town connected to a horseshoe-shaped lake that connected outward into the greater ocean. The rounded cove had natural defenses, and smaller encampments with ballistae defenses and guard towers could be seen dotting the edge of the lake. A mercantile hub, one that clearly had the potential to send pirate ships to the bottom of the ocean. So it begged the question of why these pirates had been ignored, to any astute onlooker. That all aside, they had a bit of walking to do, and no company but each other and the nearby woodland critters. Star stole occasional glances at Ellesandra, as if...Studying them. Then, set eyes forward with some pensive look upon her, only to look back at the knight again, once again studying them with curiosity, even if that meant rather obviously looking over her shoulder at them.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had followed along behind while in the woods so as to keep a better eye on Lumina, a duty that she took seriously now that she had agreed to take it on. When they got out to the road, she waited until Lumina began walking in the direction of the town to confirm it was the right direction before moving to fall into step beside Lumina. Ellesandra's caution was still up, especially considering what they'd just encountered; she kept her eye out and glanced around to the surrounding woods, behind them towards where they'd come from, and then down to the port city. If pirates had come from there, either they'd gone under the radar - which would be hard with how they were dressed - or the port city supported them in some way, which would make it quite dangerous as well. She looked over to Star, catching the woman studying her again, and let out a soft sigh. "If you have questions Miss Lumina, ask. There is no reason to to walk in silence if you have things to discuss." While Ellesandra herself was not much of a conversationalist, she also knew that after a situation like what just happened, having a conversation could help distract the woman from the trauma. Not only that, but get to know Ellesandra well enough to trust her with her protection. Ellesandra had just killed three men in front of her; it was entirely possible Star was thinking she was some cold blooded killer. She couldn't do her job well if Star didn't let her in or trust her with accurate information about their goals and destination.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was hardly surprised that she got caught staring. She wasn't being very subtle, after all. She scratched at her cheek, showing another flush of embarrassment for being called out on it. "S-Sorry," she began. "I don't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything, just..." She paused here, focusing on Ellesandra for a short while. Eyes that seemed to peer into Ellesandra's very soul. Indeed, she very well might be. She then shook her head. "I don't wish to pry into your personal matters. So please...Feel free to pretend I've said nothing at all...But I simply cannot ignore the weight I see bearing down on your shoulders. As if a mountain rests upon each of your pauldrons. I know it isn't my place, but...I cannot help that my heart tugs in my chest upon seeing it." She offered a smile at the conclusion of her words. A sympathetic smile. "I'm sure there are a thousand lighter topics to fill the air with as we walk...But the least I can do after being saved by you is offer you my ear, if talking might at all ease the weight. I know things are hardly so simple...But I can't help but extend the offer regardless."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't know what she had expected, but being asked about the 'weight on her shoulders' was not one of them. She'd thought Star was shy and wanted to get to know her, not that she could see through to Ellesandra's soul. Could she? Ellesandra frowned, the defensiveness and caution rising again. She also seemed to pull within herself, walls raising to protect herself from the question. "There is no mountain." Her voice came out in a snap, harsh and discordant. It was unintentional, not having intentionally set out to be rude to Star, but the fact that they had JUST met and she was prying into something she very much did not earn information to? Ellesandra closed herself up, jaw clenching and eyes focused straight forward rather than looking over to Star and seeing how her harsh words might have effected her. "And nothing to lend an ear for. I am here to ensure you get to Cloverport, not to share my life story." She wanted to clench her fists, to cross her arms, to distance herself more from Star, but she restrained that. She didn't want to intimidate the woman into not feeling comfortable with her, and distancing herself didn't make sense when it was her job to ensure she was safe. It was best to stay close for that purpose. She opened her mouth to ask Star a question of her own, just to redirect the topic, but then closed it. She didn't know what to ask, and didn't feel like it was appropriate to do so if she herself had just denied truly answering a question asked of her.

Perhaps surprisingly, Star didn't react poorly to Ellesandra closing off. Her smile remained, and her expression quietly spoke of how the response was expected. Her eyes also showed knowledge that refuted Ellesandra's lies. No mountain, they insisted, as Star saw it plain as day crumbling down upon their shoulders in crashing waves of grey and black, like tar clinging to them and making every movement twice as weighted. "I did say I aimed not to pry, and you were welcome to pretend I'd said nothing," she said, keeping her smile. Her eyes returned forward, then, as she continued. "Allow me, then, to give a bit more context to my journey, so you might have something to listen to as we walk." She kept her eyes forward. Her expression showed a smile, a force of strength. But there was a pain that lingered under that smile, shown with a plain openness that stood a firm foil to Ellesandra's closed off stance. "Humour me for a moment, if you will, and consider what you might know to be the rarest magic you've ever known. Even if you aren't exposed to much of the world of magic, I'm sure a knight like yourself has come to see some things more common than others. A fireball is perhaps the most ubiquitous magic there is. That would fall under the school of 'Evocation'. Evoking the forces of nature, of the elements. Controlling flames, winds, lightning, all things of that sort. Next you might consider more esoteric magics like...Teleportation, revival, necromancy. Still common enough, their power and nature notwithstanding, to be known on the common tongue. Take a step further, and you might get into magic that is known only to a select group of people, like druidic magic. Step further, and you enter the world of mystics. People whose magic starts to become as unique as the individual themselves. And when we arrive into that circle, that's, well...About where you might find me. Where other magic users might have dozens, hundreds of other magi, and thousands of books to reference about others like them that have come before that wielded the same magic as them..." She paused again, taking in a slow breath. "...There's only one other person in the whole world who I've ever known that has the same magic as me. And it is imperative that I find them again, not only to hope to preserve this magic of ours, but also, to a smaller extent, for my own sake. For closure, and for the potential betterment of my own understanding of myself, and my magic. If they are still alive, they are the only person who can guide me on using my magic to its fullest. And if they are dead...Then..." She struggled to form the words that encapsulated her feelings on this matter. "...Then I need to know. Because I cannot move on until I do."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't know what to say as Star pointed out that she could have just ignored the question. It was true, she could have, but her instinct had been to snap back. Push the woman away to make her think asking about that wasn't acceptable. The right thing to do probably would have just been ignoring her, but she was never quite so good at ignoring her emotions in instinct. In time she could repress them, surely, but that just made her angry overall. A deep breath was taken, not looking over at Star or seeing the pain in her eyes at all. In fact, Ellesandra looked everywhere EXCEPT at Star, knowing she'd probably gone too far with the harsh words. Yet, the mage had continued on to explain things as if they hadn't been harsh at all. "I certainly haven't seen magic like yours before." Ellesandra admitted, taking the bone Star had thrown her in regards to the topic change. There being only one other person in the world who had the same type of magic was probably frustrating when it came to learning it, and perhaps they were even family? Didn't unique magic lines tend to run through family blood? It sounded like a lonely journey, if Star was taking this search on her own. "Is this person you are looking for the guardian you mentioned?" She had mentioned having a guardian who was no longer available. The way it had been phrased was suspicious at the time, though if Star didn't know what happened to them and was searching for them that would explain it. She likely wouldn't want to admit the person might be dead, but also didn't want to hope otherwise. That's how Ellesandra would feel, anyways. The tension had reduced a little, listening to Star speak and asking questions in return. She was still more guarded than even when she first saw Star and the pirates, the question having certainly put her guard up, but it was quickly relaxing back to normal again. The soft clunk of her metal boots hitting the dirt beneath them, along with where her breastplate met her skirt, was a familiar accompanying sound to her walking and pacing.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"No, not that guardian I mentioned. That guardian's name is Nina. She's an old friend. And half the reason my first instinct to talk about common magics is fireballs," she said with a giggle. "Nina is a kind soul. And a fiery one. Quite literally. She possesses a soul touched by a powerful phoenix, so when I say she is indisposed, well...I mean to say she was killed. I didn't want to start with that because it sounds grim, but that phoenix within her means that she returned to life from her own ashes. A taxing process, but one she will recover from in due time. Alas, that is time I cannot remain idle, hence you finding me on my lonesome," she said, keeping her tone spirited through her words. Truly, as much as it did mean Star did very much need help for the foreseeable future, it was surely heartening to know that her dear friend wasn't truly gone. "In a year or so, she may be able to serve as my guardian again. But in truth? Part of me wishes to allow her to pursue her own life. I don't wish to shackle her with my woes, much as I'm certain she wouldn't characterize it like that," she said, giggling again. A fondness for this friend was obvious. But the two were far, far apart now. "No, the person I'm looking for is, erm...My mother." Star's tone dropped to a more sorrowful one with those words. She couldn't know how close Ellesandra was to guessing the truth before she said it. But it did certainly explain the struggles Star had with the topic. "Her name is Aurora Lumina, not that I expect anyone here to know that name. We are...Not in the right realm for anyone to know her. In fact, the first step of my journey, before I can even begin to try and find her again is...Finding a way to return home, to where I was born. To where my mother most likely is, whether she still lives or not. A far more difficult task than simply finding the path on a map and walking it, I'm afraid."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra finally glanced back at Star when she mentioned her friend, Nina, had died. Even if she was a phoenix and apparently returning to life, in some form or fashion, losing a friend couldn't be great. "Sorry to hear." Ellesandra's words were soft, spoken with a pain and sympathy of one who has known loss. And unfortunately for Ellesandra, this loss wasn't one that returned to life after a time. Looking back forwards, Ellesandra rested her right hand on the top of her rapier hilt while they walked, thumb and finger lightly tapping into the metal in a tick that she didn't even realize she had, but one that provided comfort for her all the same. "I've not heard of this Mrs. Lumina." Ellesandra confirmed in regards to not knowing the name. The right realm comment made Ellesandra glance sideways to her again before she continued. "So do you have a specific destination in which you will be able to return to your own realm? Also, if I may ask, you mentioned needing to find your mother in order to ensure your magic doesn't die out. Would you not be able to sustain your magic by having kids of your own, or is your magic not passed down via blood?" She paused, then quickly added. "If you don't mind sharing. I understand many mages, especially those of particularly unique blood lines, are sensitive to the secrets their magic may carry. I have no desire to pry into it." Ellesandra herself was a simple spellsword; she was capable of other magics, but not talented at it. The only unique magic she had was that of being able to reutilize the mana, energy within a spell; to absorb it, though she had never known where that particular ability came from.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star sputtered at the notion of her having children. Her face was now emulating the ripest of tomatoes. "W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Well...A-Ah, uhm, you see, I...Uhm...That is...Aaah...Uhm..." This stammering continued for a short while. She tapped her index fingers together, idly spun some of her snow-white hair around one index, and idly fidgeted with her hands in general while trying to answer that question. "...I-It is, well, passed through lineage, s-so, that much is true! B-But the ideal would s-still be that I, erm...H-Have a little guidance on the matter before I go...Thinking about...T-That..." Her words quieted to a whisper by the end of that. There was other matters to discuss, but the notion of children had thrown Star for such a loop that the rest got lost in translation, and now she was just...Silently steaming in her own head while waiting for the knight's reply, still as bright red in the cheeks as could be.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected the notion of kids to fluster the mage so. She looked over and for the briefest of seconds, amusement passed through them. There was even a very small uptick to the corner of their mouth at the sight of Star stammering and going red enough that she looked like steam would come out of her ears. Looking forward, Ellesandra spoke again. "My apologies, Miss Lumina. I did not intend to embarrass you or imply kids were your only option. Many people eschew such things, or are incapable of creating such, and there would be no shame in such." Ellesandra wasn't sure if Star was simply inexperienced and thus flustered at the concept, or if it was embarrassment for a reason such as being unable to. It didn't matter; apparently the topic had been quite intense for Star, so Ellesandra felt the need to apologize. The amusement had faded quickly, only showing briefly, but it did lighten Ellesandra's mood a little. Her guard was still up, but it wasn't being held up firmly; it was more that Ellesandra's natural state was to have it up as she went about her daily life.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star needed a bit of time to recoup from that, but her blush was going to be sustained for a little while as she tried to move those thoughts out of her mind to refocus on other topics. She gently shook her head. "N-No, it's okay. It's not your fault. I-I suppose I just, well, had never really focused on that quite as much. N-Not even so much romantic prospects, l-let alone.." She shook her head again, more vigorously this time. A soft huff followed as she sought composure once more. She wasn't about to go on to say how she was perfectly capable, or so she assumed, or other embarrassing subjects about herself with this woman she'd just met, mostly because it would be a little too much information, so she sought to pivot. "A-Anyway...U-Uhm." Deep breath. "I, er...I want to understand myself, first and foremost, is I suppose the point I'm getting at. Not that I'm...Going to turn away from any romantic prospects that might arise, but for the moment I have a clear direction that has made maintaining long-standing friendships...Difficult. There are many who are not cut out for a vagrant life rife with dangers, and there's no shame in that. I just...Hope to brighten the lives of those I encounter, when I do encounter them, you know?" She asked with a smile. The two were getting closer to the city. The sun was still high in the sky, so there were plenty of hours of daylight left for them to make use of. Another ten or so minutes of walking and they would hit the outskirts.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had to bite back her initial response of calling Star on her...inexperience. Not calling so much, but commenting on it and calling her flustered attitude cute. It wasn't appropriate, or needed from a stranger. Instead, she looked off towards the outskirts of the town, keeping an eye out even as they approached. If those pirates had come from here, it was entirely possible there were more. "It is entirely valid to want to find yourself before finding a partner or considering children. And admirable that you recognize it may not be the best time to actively search, Miss Lumina." Her words had gone back to the formal way of speaking, which for her was a more relaxed situation compared to when she'd snapped at the mage. Still, Ellesandra would change the topic - both for Star to not get too embarrassed, and also to redirect their thoughts to the path ahead. "We are near the city and have daylight to burn. Did you have a plan upon arriving, a ship you were intending to get on? If not, I would recommend finding a place to stay for the night before travelling on to the next location, we're far enough along in the day that starting off now wouldn't be entirely wise, especially considering the attack that already happened on this road."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star showed the appreciation in her face at the change of topic. Some time for her to cool off. She nodded to the question about a plan. "Mmn. There's someone in town I'm meeting. I was told they might have information about how to get to the next leg of my journey. I...Somehow doubt it will be a straight forward affair, and may not be without its cost, but...I will figure something out once I meet them. I was referred to someone named Morrun Dayflower. A high elven scholar who had some information about a lead I was chasing. All sounds very vague, I'm sure, but when we sit down with him I'm sure it'll make more sense. I don't intend on getting on a ship, though, no. Unless the next destination requires it. And I do have enough money for a night at an inn, assuming they are keeping reasonable prices, if we need to stay around. That being said, if the pirates are making this place a home, I might sooner find camp among the trees if there are no storm clouds this night. Not that I don't feel infinitely safer around someone like you, but, I would not shackle you to a night if you have somewhere else to be," she said, offering a genuine smile at Ellesandra. "I'm not one for needless conflict, regardless. The sight of death disturbs me greatly, even if I know in my mind it was righteously done."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was surprised, and considered commenting, on Star's use of 'we'. Was she taking for granted that Ellesandra would accompany her for such? She had only technically agreed to see her to the city safely, though Star had a good point that if the city was overtaken by pirates it might be safer to sleep outside of the city. After listening to the rest, she decided not to call Star out on her assumption that Ellesandra would join her. For now, she would. Instead she ran the name Morrun Dayflower through her mind to figure out if she had heard of them. She hadn't, but she'd met many a mage in one of her last jobs and sometimes had to focus on trying to think of them and who all she met. "What exactly was your plan, if you were to run out of money? Surely you didn't expect to be able to find your mother so quickly on limited funds, if you're at the point of commenting about having enough money to stay the night at an inn." Typically, that was a given for travelers. If Star were so hard up on coin to make that an active consideration, Ellesandra couldn't imagine how she was planning to finish her journey entirely on her own. "And you mentioned a cost from this Morrun for getting you to the right realm as well." They added in consideration for that. Was Star just going on a whim and hoping things fell into place? Ellesandra felt both an irritation at such foolishness, and a protectiveness of the naivety of it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently shook her head. "I've always been able to find work healing. It's just been a long road since I was in a major settlement. I admit there are times I will pass up compensation for what I do when I'm in a squalid town. There's little joy in taking from those who live in houses with roofs in disrepair that catch the rainwater in pots, and have to grovel to the local lords come time for tax collection, even if I myself am hard off. A place like Cloverport is sure to have more work for me; I simply meant to say that extortionist prices aren't worth the comfort when I am well-enough accustomed to life among nature," she said, hoping her correction put things in better perspective. She had coin, she just had to ration it. A mindset for the long term, rather than the immediate. Suffering now for comfort later. "I've been searching for my mother for several years now. Since I was nineteen, in fact. I'm twenty-three now. Before that, I did what I could to find any information about my magics. I'm sure you can imagine with my previous comments how well that went," she said, giving a soft grin at the notion. "As for the cost, well. I don't suspect it will be coin. Often, magi trade in lore, artifacts, or services. I do not know what Morrun will want. Speculation helps me little. The best I can do is step forward, be open and honest, and see where that path will take me. Of course...The years traveling have made me better able to know when that approach is best substituted for a more...Evasive one. But I guess you'll just have to trust me when I tell you I have a pretty infallible eye for when someone has less than pure intentions. I knew from the moment I saw you that I could trust you, after all, even before you challenged the pirates. And I could tell you didn't exactly trust me right away." She kept a smile about her as she spoke so plainly about this. "I don't blame you, of course. I'm a strange woman with strange magic, and these roads can be dangerous to everyone, even someone as stalwart as yourself."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt surprise, and a little bit of shame at how quickly she'd jumped to assumptions about Star. Apparently, she'd thought this out more than she'd thought originally. Nodding along to the explanation Star gave, and the apparent soft heart she had, Ellesandra felt herself thankful that she'd happened upon the bandits ambush in time. Someone like Star seemed to be the type of person this world needed more of, and it would have been quite a shame if those men had decided to kill her. "I apologize, Miss Lumina, for my assumption then. You seem to have prepared and planned for this more than I initially expected." She listened as Star explained how she had a good eye for someone's intentions, and that she could tell Ellesandra had not trusted her. She still didn't trust Star, not entirely anyways. She trusted Star not to randomly attack her, or maybe not to try to steal her purse, but she didn't really trust the mage yet. It would take more than a single conversation on an hour's long walk to get to that. "I mean no offense to you, of course Miss Lumina, for my lack of trust. It's entirely focused on experience, not that you seem untrustworthy." A nod was given to the idea of the strange magic. "And not understanding your magic doesn't help with that. But then again, magic isn't the best way to take me out, considering my own abilities around it." She was vague on purpose, not wanting to make it so that Star would understand enough to be able to work around such abilities.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I did say I don't blame you, didn't I?" she said, smiling at Ellesandra. She clearly took no offense. "You wouldn't be the first person to assume me some naiive, innocent woman. And while I do indeed hold good intentions for any who share those towards me, I am also aware that it has the duality of both...Inviting evil-doers to take advantage, as well as...Lulling those same evil-doers into consistently underestimating me. I do...Very much detest having to use my powers for harm. But I must, at times, as a last resort. Being outnumbered, however is...Still a major disadvantage." She gave another smile. Would she have come out of that okay? Maybe. But the likely scenario was that she took far more grievous wounds in the process. Her minimal injury remained possible thanks to the knight at her side. She took note of how Ellesandra was...Not a prime target for magic, and took note of this in the back of her mind, but did not press the issue. The two had arrived at the city outskirts at this point. The port city was busy, but not overly bustling. Guards at the gate stood in towers with crossbows; a stone perimeter wall surrounded the whole of the city. Things looked to be business as usual. Once inside the gates, the port to the east was the primary attraction, but the north and western faces of the city had plenty of businesses. A tavern, an inn, a smith, a breadmaker, several clothiers that sported sail-related signage that were doubtlessly adept at mending torn ship sails, among several other more niche businesses. But as the two moved through the city, one thing would be clear: The red and white striped shirts of the pirates featured on many others within the city. No ship in the port was flying the Jolly Roger flag, but...These pirates had gotten into the city, and were pervasive through it. They appeared to be keeping lawful, though some less than subtle cat-calls were made at Ellesandra and Star from the periphery. Star chose to ignore them and step onwards, aiming to head towards The Salty Salmon tavern, which appeared to be quite the main attraction at the center of the city. But if the knight saw fit to cause a scene, Star would stick by their side through it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra knew Star had said she didn't blame her, but that didn't mean she shouldn't be polite and apologize for such an expectation. She continued walking while listening to Star's explanation, feeling their gut tighten at the thought. "If only everyone had expectations of said duality." The words were mumbled to herself, not necessarily intended for Star to hear. The guilt intensified, fully wrapping around a core of sorrow that settled deep in her gut. She took a deep breath, and the emotions bundled up and were pushed down, being well and truly ignored once again. She'd gotten quite good at that. As they made their way into the city, Ellesandra became more on guard. They made sure to walk a bit closer to Star, ensuring any onlookers knew they were together and not just walking side by side, and that Star was under Ellesandra's protection. She had to resist the temptation to reach out and touch the small of Star's back, a habit in a similar situation in her past. It was interesting how people who looked similar to the pirates, and how multiple of them seemed to be roaming the city. This realization made Ellesandra walk with her right hand resting on the top of the rapier hilt, though she continued walking forward as if there weren't a problem at all. If there was anything she was good at, it was being on guard without looking like she was paranoid or activley watching everything. "You know the way to this contact of yours, Miss Lumina?" She asked, looking straight forward while keeping an eye on both of their purses as they entered the city with more people here and there. Cat calls were entirely ignored; it would only bring attention to them if they did anything about it prior to the callers getting more aggressive.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I was told to meet them here," she said, gesturing to The Salty Salmon tavern that was soon before them. The bustle of the core of the city could be heard from here, mostly as a dull roar in the background. Closer to the ports sat an open-air market that held most of the congestion of the city. Things of all nature being traded, possibly even less legal things in the darker corners. If the two should have to travel through that space, coin-purses would need near constant supervision, surely. Ignoring that, Star had kept an eye on Ellesandra as much as they kept an eye on everyone else. Star did have a habit of staring, it seemed. Whatever she might be looking at would remain a mystery for the time being, but she certainly seemed to be looking for, or at...Something. That attention stopped when they reached the tavern and pushed inside. The interior was decently busy. Not too many free tables, and the happy jaunt of a bard strumming a lute somewhere on the left side of the interior could be heard. A sea shanty, it seemed, as the lyrics waxed on about woes of a life at sea, hungry bellies and wet clothes in chasing a golden payday. Star took a rather direct route through the tavern to the right and towards the back. Seemed she had been given a precise meeting place. She joined a lone elven man at his table that had room for four. The man eyed Ellesandra, however, with a look that suggested they were an unexpected addition to the meeting. "Morrun?" asked Star. The elven man nodded. In the dull light of the tavern, Morrun's darker, moonlight-toned complexion made the shadows cling tightly to him. He was quite tall, clearly, but quite thin as well. Spectacles made his dull brown eyes larger than they were while looking at him. His brown hair was in a tight ponytail, though his hair wasn't terribly long. "Star, I take it?" asked the man in return. Star nodded. "And this is Ellesandra. She has graciously been my escort to the city," she said, notably keeping the introduction in line with their agreement. To the city, and nothing more. Morrun gave a small hum of acknowledgement. "Right. Well. I heard you were looking for magic that could help you divine a location, and then presumably get there," asked the elven man, his expression rather neutral as the two discussed business. He didn't give away much of anything in the way of what he might be thinking or feeling beyond the initial surprise of Ellesandra's presence, but he quickly accepted that as well. Star nodded to the man's summation. "That's about right. I was told you had information on the matter," Star replied. Morrun nodded. "Aye. I've got a lead for you. Not directly the magic you're looking for, but...A nugget. A trail you can follow that will get you closer to it," he said, then drew in a swift sniff. He eased back in his chair, crossing his arms. His arms, like the rest of him, were thin. The frame of a scholar, not a fighter. He had a pack by his feet which presumably contained some of his materials; the wooden ends of a scroll were visible poking out of the top if one leaned to look under the table to spy it. "...But I've got two conditions." He struck a stern expression as he said this. Preparing for pushback on the notion, perhaps, and ready to meet it firmly. Star didn't respond immediately, instead...Eyeing the man in a way that was vaguely similar to the way she studied Ellesandra along the way to the city. Just looking at him, as if she saw something. Whatever the case, it gave a pause in the conversation, if Ellesandra had anything to add.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt relieved when they reached their destination. Being inside a tavern might not be entirely safe either, but at the very least she wouldn't have to keep an eye on all the crowd. Normally this wasn't as bit of an issue, but with the pirates and the encounter Star had previously had with them already Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable with any of them. She did notice Star watching her, but didn't think anything of it, assuming this was simply Star being cautious about her as well, or finding something interesting. Perhaps her armor, or her demeanor or something? There were even some people who were interested in the color of her hair at a young age, though based on Star's own hair that was unlikely. She nodded, and let Star lead them into the tavern with a glance at the sign and name hanging before them. Salty Salmon seemed like a perfect name for a tavern in a port city, playing up to the fisherman or pirate customers. She followed Star in and did a quick sweep of the room, eyes scanning different doors and potential exits other than the front door just in case anything went down that required a quick escape. The fact they walked to the back corner of the room made Ellesandra uncomfortable, as it was likely going to put their backs to the rest of the room. She made no attempt to hide her perusal of the man sitting, also eyeing her. A quick assessment of any weapons that were obvious on his form, and then only giving him a brief nod when Star introduced her. As the two began to discuss business, Ellesandra stepped around the table, to the side. This put her a bit further from Star, but it allowed her the ability to keep an eye both on the room and on this man, Morrun, without having to constantly turn her head or look behind her. It also placed her back to one of the walls, which was ideal. Her arms crossed, listening into the conversation while taking up a practiced bodyguard's unseeing stare past Star. An illusion of privacy, as if Ellesandra wasn't there listening even if she was. Her lips were pressed into a thin line at the conditions comment, though no response given. This was Star's business to deal with.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pause in conversation lasted a few moments, Star and the elven man eyeing one another closely. Star eventually nodded. "Very well, what are they?" she asked, her voice more or less unchanged. She had mentioned expecting this, so it was likely little surprise how calmly she received it. Morrun gave a terse nod, then laid out his conditions: "First, five thousand gold pieces. Upfront. Non-negotiable," he said, his voice firm. Considering that a skilled bodyguard like Ellesandra could expect between one and at most five gold pieces per day for their services as a very well accomplished knight, and that a night's stay at the local inn was only eight silver - with ten silver to one gold - a price of five thousand gold was laughable. Absurd. A small fortune, and for what? Vague information? Despite the absurdity, Star said nothing, allowing the man to continue. "...And the other is that if your exploration of my valuable information bears fruit, I require a full report of your findings for my own study." By contrast, a far more reasonable request, though still arguably pompous on the man's part. Star gave another pause. She then tilted her head slightly. "What do you need the gold for?" she inquired simply. The man's brows knit and he leaned forward on the table, supported on his elbows. "The information I have is worth as much! It's none of your business what I use it for," he scoffed back, indignant. Star remained calm and composed in the face of this. She then lowered her voice to a volume that would make it so only the man and Ellesandra would be able to overhear: "...Why are you lying?" she asked, causing the man to grit his teeth and leer at Star. "Wh...What are you talking about? I've said no word of a lie!" he insisted, his tone hushing to match hers. His eyes then began to dart around, looking at some of the other patrons in the bar. Those patrons in question didn't seem to take notice of the discussion, though with Ellesandra's watch, it would be easy to pick up on some...Wandering eyes. Certain folk in the tavern were carrying on about their business with their tablemates, but also occasionally did look over at the table with Star and Morrun. Not directly spying, but...Seemed their meeting had some interest to certain folk present, who were trying - and failing - to be subtle about it. At least failing under the scrutiny of the experienced knight, that is. Nobody was standing up. Nobody was encroaching. But people were watching. Possibly listening. But there'd be no listening in on the current hushed voices. "You are lying," said Star, still hushed. "You grew nervous talking about the condition of gold. You were calm talking about the second condition, however. And when I asked you what the gold was for, you had a very large rise in anxiety. And now as I'm explaining to you how I know you're lying, your anxieties are getting stronger. You're...Scared about something. Guilty, as well," she went on to explain, her voice still kind as ever, even as she dissected the man's heart like it was laying on the table. If Ellesandra had been observing the man, they would not have been able to notice any clear tells about anything Star was saying. Perhaps Star was just bluffing? Morrun looked visibly shaken by this, however. "W-What are you doing? Reading my mind or something?!" he asked, keeping his voice low despite his clear anxiety. Star smiled and shook her head. "No. But that does say rather plainly that I am right, doesn't it?" she replied, still smiling. "If you'd just be honest, then perhaps I can help you. Because I certainly don't have five thousand gold to my name." Another pause in the conversation appeared, as the man was sent reeling and deliberating. His nervous demeanor, however, had earned the scrutiny of a pirate-looking fellow at another table. A suspicious eye trained on Morrun, suggesting some manner of...Investment in the elven man's dealings.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Was Star able to read people? not minds, Ellesandra didn't expect that was possible if she'd gotten into the position she'd been in before. She could have used that against the pirates if so, or maybe not even have gotten caught. But some people were just empaths, able to easily read someone's body language and tell how they were feeling. Was that why Star had kept looking at her during their walk? Could she tell that Ellesandra was working through her guilt at the memories Star brought up? Her jaw clenched at the thought, glancing towards Morrun for a moment to ensure that he didn't respond poorly at being called out, then back out into the tavern room. The pirate looking fellow keeping a suspicious eye on Morrun had her guard up, and though she obviously looked at him once when she first noticed him, she didn't keep an eye directly on him. Doing so would only alert him that she'd caught him staring with too much interest. Instead, she began looking at other tables, both to keep him in peripheral vision and also to see if there were any others that were looking towards the pirate man, or also looking towards their table. She did lean down briefly to whisper to Star, completely ignoring Morrun. "Heads up, Miss Lumina, your contact here has the active interest of at least one pirate in the tavern." It was a validation of what Lumina was saying, as well as encouraging Morrun to put his cards on the table. He couldn't exactly deny it at this point, not with how well Star had read him and that Ellesandra had called out he was being actively watched. Whether or not he actually did so would be up to him, but most would understand that sharing that information would be beneficial to getting any actual business done.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A brief time passed as Morrun weighed his options. Star leaned into the whisper that Morrun was certainly intended to hear as well, and nodded. She looked at him, once more studying him. Eventually, his conviction broke, and he sighed. "...Look," he began, quiet as he could be while still being audible. "The pirates. They took my wife. They tried to extort me, and when I said I didn't have the gold, they took her as...Collateral," he said, nearly spitting the final word. "They want five thousand gold as ransom, or who knows what they'll do. Who knows what they've already done," he said, moving his left hand up to push through his hair. A golden wedding band with green etching depicting an elvish phrase was on his ring finger. Not immediately obvious in the dim light, but visible if one was looking for it. Star's expression softened dramatically, not that it was ever particularly hard in the first place. Star moved to touch the thin lines of dried blood that were on her cheek, briefly closing her eyes as she did. "Mmn. I'm no stranger to their barbarity. I'm very sorry to hear that has happened to you, Morrun. I will get her free again for you and get her out of the city. So you'll do well to find a way to slip out without attracting attention." Just like that, Star was jumping head-first into what was obviously a dangerous situation. Not counting the deck-hands on the ship itself, the city had plenty more of a pirate presence. Enough to suggest theirs was one of the larger vessels in port. Did Star have a plan? It would be hard to assume she did, given the whole two minutes she had to come up with one. But she'd already proven in the past to be a thoughtful woman...So it would be difficult to know. Naturally, this had Morrun...More than a little skeptical. "Wh- You can't be serious," he said with a chuckle. A chuckle that was asking to be laughed along with. "This is...This is a joke, right?" he continued, looking at Star, then Ellesandra. "L-Look, I obviously want her back, more than anything. But, like...Are ye' blind, woman? Have you not seen how many of them there are? And no offence to either of you, but they've each got as much muscle in their arms as you do in your whole body. And much as your uh, escort there, looks plenty mean...I think you'll be needing about five of her at least to hold your own." Through all of Morrun's doubts, Star never buckled. She maintained an air of serenity and calm about her, as if the danger before her was trivial. It wasn't. She already showed how just three pirates were a danger for her. Was Star truly insane? So determined to do the right thing that she'd carelessly lay down her life just to try? One look at her said very clearly that she wasn't scared, if nothing else..

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced quickly back at Morrun when he mentioned they had taken his wife. A frown creased her face, but that was the only emotion that she displayed for people to see. Displeasure on her face, which could easily have been taken for him making an unreasonable demand. Her eyes narrowed at him for a moment, then looked back out onto the room to keep up guard. It would not, however, be hard for Star to see the anger that burned bright in Ellesandra. There was a desire, briefly, to walk over to the pirate who was keeping an eye on Morrun and just slam his head into the table. She would never do this, of course. She was too well trained and restrained to start something like this, but the desire to do so was there. She hadn't considered how she was going to respond to the situation when Star apparently volunteered to help save the woman. Ellesandra looked back at Star with alarm. "Miss Lumina" She said in protest, placing a hand on the table and partially leaning over it to mask her mouth movements as she spoke. "While I can empathize with wishing to help rescue this man's wife, that is a very dangerous activity to take on." For once, she actually agreed with this Morrun fellow; this had to be a joke. Ellesandra could take on a handful of pirates without magic surely, but a whole ship of them, potentially more? "If they are trained like the ones in the woods I can take on four or five together without magic I think, but a whole ship is pushing it even with magic, Miss Lumina." Nowhere in this had Star volunteered Ellesandra to help with this, but there was an unspoken expectation that Ellesandra was not letting Star do that alone.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had looked at Ellesandra briefly when the flash of anger rose up within them. Something that might be a little too coincidental. But it was brief and subtle enough to be overshadowed by other things. The tag-team of the elven man and the knight trying to talk her out of this had Star smiling even wider. To the point of giggling under her breath. Her bright, positive outlook was immune in that moment. "Well, there you both go assuming I had planned to fight. I did tell you I'm not so much a fan of doing that, didn't I, Miss. Rhinelander?" she said, mysterious as she was chipper about it all. "I know you're just as angry inside about this situation as I am," she continued, speaking to Ellesandra. "So you can rest just as easy as Morrun here. I'll take care of it. You've already saved me from danger once, so I'll do my absolute utmost to ensure it needn't be twice in one day, all right?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't notice the coincidental glance in time with their anger, but they did notice how Star seemed to call her anger out. Her eyebrows knitted in confusion for a moment, wondering if her anger had really been that noticeable on her face. She was usually better at keeping her anger in check on jobs, since it was a pretty important thing to make your client happy with you and if you were expressing anger at them they would feel uncomfortable. Taking a deep breath to work the anger down and mentally scold themselves for being so readable, they looked over to Morrun, then back out into the tavern. "Well, what exactly is your plan then, Miss Lumina? We've had but a few minutes of learning this, don't know what ship they're on or if she's even on the ship." Maybe Ellesandra was jumping to conclusions right now. Perhaps Star only really planned to do some information gathering, not actually go on a rescue mission. That would make more sense. Still, Star was giggling - did she not understand the danger she'd be in if the pirates caught her, based on how many they seem to have seen in town? Sure if so many were in town there might be a chance fewer were on the ship, but they had no idea what numbers they might be looking at.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star took note of the breath. The internal revision. The self-scolding. While Star couldn't know what precisely was going on in the woman's head, she knew enough about emotional patterns to take a solid guess. So it was, Star was left with a knowing, sympathetic smile on her lips. She didn't say a word about it, but looking at her, she certainly seemed to know...Something. But how could she? Had Ellesandra been so plain? Morrun similarly had been quite stalwart in hiding any emotion, and yet Star sniffed it out with only a few moments of that...Curious, studious gaze. How strange, indeed. With all said, Star looked at Morrun. "Can you point out which ship is theirs?" she asked. Morrun hastily nodded. "They've a few in port, but the primary galleon of their fleet is where she's being held," he said, keeping a hush about him to prevent unwanted listeners. "I saw them take her aboard. Couldn't tell you where inside, but...The captain's probably on the ship, too, an' he's a mean fucker. Are you...Sure you know what you're doing? He's not really one to be persuaded by anything but gold," Morrun went on to say. Star gently shook her head. "I wouldn't try to reason with them. Or rather...I already did try to do that, and it didn't work out so well," she said, offering a nervous giggle as she once more called reference back to Ellesandra's intervention. "So? What are you going to do?" he asked, looking at Ellesandra briefly as he echoed their request to know what Star was planning. Star took a moment to collect her thoughts, then nodded to herself. "I'm going to board the ship, find your wife, and take her to the outskirts of the city. The only part I still need to figure out is...How to get you, Morrun, out of the city without raising suspicion. All the pirates in the tavern here are on edge, likely expecting a big payday. They're undoubtedly going to have questions about how our meeting went. So we'll need to have something convincing that keeps them from thinking something is amiss. It might help if we make a louder announcement of agreement, to make it seem like I'm going to abide by the initial terms of payment." While it seemed Star had put a good deal of thought into this, the arguably most important part - the rescue - was something she seemed quite content to just leave at her just...Walking aboard and taking a prisoner away, as if she expected the pirates to be perfectly content with this plan of hers. Once more, Morrun was looking with exceptional uncertainty at Ellesandra, as if seeking confirmation from the knight as to whether Star was sane or not.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was similarly disappointed with Star's current plan of just walking on board this pirate ship and getting the prisoner. She crossed her arms, her face all but in a permanent frown during this conversation. Ellesandra was also concerned about this supposed captain on board. It took every ounce of her willpower not to ask Star if she had lost her mind, but she had to assume the woman had some sort of plan, right? She didn't seem to be suicidal, considering her mission and determination to find her mother. A glance was given to Morrun, all but meeting his eye and agreeing with him in regards to Star being crazy. Ellesandra considered whether or not she should just walk away. A glance towards the door was given and the thought crossed her mind, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Not only would that likely be condemning the man's wife, but even Star for whatever foolish plan she was going with. "I strongly disagree with this course of action, Miss Lumina. It isn't worth this." Her voice was loud enough to be heard this time. Her words were true, but she also knew that saying such out loud would make the listening in pirates think that Star was planning to actually pay the 5000 gold to Morrun, not that Star was planning to rescue his wife.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
And without missing a beat, Star was right alongside Ellesandra's lead, speaking aloud. "You might disagree with the price of a life, Miss. Rhinelander. But it's obvious. They have all the power, all the control. We'll have to find a way to gather up the money and pay the ransom," she said, smiling a knowing smile at Ellesandra. She then spoke quietly. Quietly enough for just Ellesandra to hear: "Please...Trust me. I won't be dying today," she said, then drew in a slow breath. "Hopefully, nobody else has to die today. I know I have already asked much of you, but...You're much more likely able to defend Morrun if it comes to that. Would I...Be able to rely on you to escort him beyond the city limits, into the northern forests?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well, Ellesandra wouldn't have gone so far as to talk about the ransom out loud. Maybe just agreeing to the terms about paying the 5,000 for this service. Still, Ellesandra didn't SHOW the surprise on her face, even if she felt it. And a little bit of irritation and worry directed at Star for being so upfront about it. The pirates might not be happy that Morrun had spoken to them of the ransom, rather than just requesting the money from them. A glance was given his way, then back to Star. "I will not let you go face whatever you are doing alone. Not without hearing your plan." And honestly, not likely with that. She wasn't going to let a charge walk into a trap or a dangerous situation, and lose her. Not again. The guilt and sorrow started to bubble up, but it was pushed down again. She couldn't let past mistakes effect her focus now, but she also couldn't help but learn from them. She wouldn't let Star go be reckless on her own.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The word 'ransom' did very much perk up the attention of a few pirates. But where any civil city would hear a crime in the midst and call to the guards...It only seemed to embolden the pirates in the Salty Salmon. Chuckles resounded from a few of them. Beer steins clinked together. Hearing 'all the power, all the control' had the pirates donning wide smirks, and even managed to identify a few patrons who broke into grins over the words who were not wearing the same colours. Sympathizers? Undercover agents? It was hard to say. But one thing was certain: The bartender was horrified. Scared for his life as he shakily wiped clean a beer stein. A few clues that one might be able to use to discern that threats and violence had beaten this city into submission. It was, once again, another of Star's appeal to emotion. An attempt to make the pirates feel more secure. The way they had appealed to Ellesandra in the forest, the cocky, arrogant way with which they described their obviously illegal actions, making a mockery of Ellesandra's integrity by exerting force of their presence over those who dared to stand up to them was likely far more effective against those not clad in Ellesandra's knightly attire. Star listened to Ellesandra's request, and it caused Star to don a briefly...Complicated expression. She was studying them again. A bit of wetness then appeared in Star's eyes. Too hard for any but Ellesandra to see given the dim light. But it was there. The start of tears. But Star blinked them away, steadying herself. "Not here," she said, keeping a whisper. "Announce that you have to take me some place to secure the money. Make up something believable, and lucrative. Just something that can buy us time to get somewhere private. I can explain everything there where other ears aren't listening."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She took a deep breath, pushing down again on the irritation and concern. She shouldn't be letting those be so visible, even though to anyone but Star they didn't seem to be. Still, Star could seemingly read her face well enough to recognize that Ellesandra was getting more emotional about this than she should. At least, based on the expression Star had given her, Ellesandra assumed that. "Fine." The word came out harshly, as if she were angry at a young child being petulant. That emotion was actually behind it, but Ellesandra wasn't a half-bad actor. "If you insist on throwing your money away for this project, lets at least go and secure the coin so we can ensure it gets into the right hands and isn't pickpocketed on the street. It may not be MY gold, but I'll be damned if I let some two-bit pickpocket make off with it instead of securing our transaction. I know you don't like blood, so I'll warn you now any scoundrel who tries will have my sword through their palm and pinning it to their eye." Okay, that was grotesque, and Ellesandra would not do that. She was not quite so gruesome or ruthless, but pirates respected such threats, didn't they? While Ellesandra was okay with killing someone if she deemed it necessary in a situation, she would never go out of her way to make a scene of it or make it any more painful than it had to be. Well - with one scenario's exception, but she was NOT thinking about that. Stepping back, she looked through the tavern and motioned for Star to get up and lead the way out, keeping up her angry persona with a set jaw and furious eyes that dared anyone in the tavern to reach for either of them.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star lightly winced at the harsh, admonishing words. Her intent was never to upset Ellesandra, and seeing that she did so had clearly affected her. Ellesandra might hide all their pain and emotion as well as they could, but Star continued to do anything but, and took the insight of a five-year-old to determine what she was feeling in most moments. Was she capable of hiding her emotion? Perhaps. She had showed some subtlety when under duress when Ellesandra first happened upon her. And she clearly knew how to tie together a ruse. Was Ellesandra right to hold sincere doubts about Star? To hold back trust? She was hardly a simple woman to figure out. "Keep comfy here, Morrun. We'll come back to find you," she said to the elf. As she stood to join Ellesandra, the effects of the knight's words was clear on the tavern. Pirates specifically avoided making eye contact, chuckling to themselves as the threat hunger over the room. "Oooh, tough girl and her princess, eh?" came one muttering as the two passed by. "Ey, should let cap'n know to double the price. Girlie's got such nice clothes, she obviously can afford it," said another to his comrades. Laughs and chuckling was had at the expense of the two. Star ignored it all, as she presumed Ellesandra would, too. She kept an eye on them, however. Just watching them. Studying them, as she continued to be. Nobody dared reach for or try to stop the two, content to hide behind petty comments. If the two broke away, a some ten minute walk would see them able to reach the north edge of the city, and another five to rise up a lazy hill path to a forested edge, making it look for any onlookers that the two were well and truly departing to some other place to secure the coin. If all went well, she sought out a secure space concealed by the trees, an offshoot from the main path that led to a small pond that gave good concealment among the trees, then turned to Ellesandra to hear their concerns and answer their questions. Of course, if the knight's emotions got the better of them before then and a fight broke out, then Star would have some improvising to do.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had been acting in her anger for the most part, at least for the last bit there. She had been irritated at, and concerned for Star for putting herself in this situation, and there was anxiety in regards to whether this would turn out similarly to past situations like this. However, that anger ignited for real as soon as she'd begun to follow Star out and someone commented on them being a Knight and her Princess. It took every ounce of Ellesandra's willpower not to lash out. The anger and pain that comment had brought up wasn't something most people would be able to tell, of course. It flared in them, the ball of pain fueling the anger at such a comment, at how it cut much, much deeper than Ellesandra would ever admit out loud. Her left hand moved to rest on the rapier upon her right hip, casually threatening to draw it if needed, and squeezing tightly to the hilt in an attempt to keep it busy from just striking one of them on their way to the door. Getting out of the tavern was a breath of fresh air, even if they were still surrounded by potential enemies. Ellesandra didn't let her guard down even as they crested the hill, glancing down below them for a good view of if they had been followed at all. She scanned the area for a moment, taking that time to collect herself and bottle emotions tighter. Star was too similar to Ellesandra's past; as soon as this job was done she needed to move on or this would just keep coming up. Turning, she nodded to Star to begin her explanation.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Indeed, they had not been followed. Star hat noticed very swiftly the correlation between the comment and Ellesandra's anger. She saw it flare up around them like an inferno engulfing them. She held trust in them to keep it under wraps, but the final moments walking out of the tavern were...Tense. It showed on Star once they were in the clear. She was visibly concerned as she looked at Ellesandra. But, an explanation had to come first. She drew in a slow, steadying breath. She then closed her eyes. She extended an arm. A blue aura possessed her arm, slowly shifting around it with wispy lines of mana. Then, she slowly closed her hand into a fist. The aura, once a soft, sky blue, became a shimmering beacon of scintillating colours. A rainbow, kaleidoscopically shimmering with a trillion different colours. It covered from her fingertips to her shoulder. She was clearly concentrating on this. Her eyes opened, looking at Ellesandra. "...Strike my arm, Miss. Rhinelander. Hard as you can." She paused, smiling. "...Trust me."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
On the way, Ellesandra was too distracted with her emotions and keeping an eye out for any trouble to notice how Star was looking at her. On top of that, she had used the time spent getting to their location to help filter out her anger. It was still there when they stopped, but deep conscientious breathing had helped to reduce the intensity of it. When Star began summoning some sort of blue light, then a rainbow around her arm brought curiosity to the front. Was Star displaying some form of her ability to Ellesandra, as explanation for the plan? However, when she was asked to strike Star as hard as she can, she snorted. She didn't respond verbally, but she also had no plan to actually strike Star as hard as she could. She'd known this mage for what, three hours at this point, maybe less? She didn't trust Star yet; trust was not something Ellesandra gave easily. Reaching out, Ellesandra did strike Star's arm with an open palm, about as hard as a sibling might punch one another in a friendly jesting way. Not intended to really damage, but if whatever she was doing didn't block any of the impact it would be sore. That would be enough for her to identify what exactly was happening and how sturdy Star's magic might be. She did have to make an active effort not to draw Star's magic into herself when making contact with it, however. If this was supposed to be a test to how Star would hold up against the pirates, it would not do to use her own unique abilities on it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star remained still as Ellesandra struck her arm. Or rather, attempted to. Ellesandra instead struck something that felt solid as adamantine. Star's arm did not move in the slightest. If either of them would be sore, it would be the knight, but as much was unlikely given their less than enthusiastic strike. Star just smiled. "If that's as hard as you can hit, I will have to wonder who it was aided me against the pirates a few short hours ago," she said with a giggle. "...Your blade, much less those of the pirates, cannot harm me if I have time, mana, and focus enough to employ this strength of my gift. I encourage you to truly strike my arm, so you can hold confidence in more than my words that I will be safe." She kept her smile. "...I do keep asking you to trust me, but...I understand that that doubts I see in you will remain. I hope only that I can prove in time that I have aimed to be trustworthy at every step. You did save me, after all. I'd not wish to return to that initial scenario in which you found to me to test fate and see if my magic would have guided me from harm. I owe you at least my honesty for that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shouldn't have been surprised. She'd made the attack expecting magic to have somehow strengthened Star's arm, but it being as completely solid as it felt still made her raise an eyebrow. "To be fair, Miss Lumina." She said, frowning at the comment about the pirates. "I hardly struck the pirates with any strength. Three quick stabs was all that was needed, none of which required strength behind them." It was true; between them having been blinded and her own haste spell, which in hindsight wasn't necessary but Ellesandra hadn't known how inexperienced the pirates were at first, it had been simple to get past their guard and simply shove a sharp blade into fleshy skin. When invited to truly strike Lumina's arm though, she had shaken her head in refusal. "If I were to not hold back, Miss Lumina, I would absorb the magic effecting your arm, and strike through it. Or enchant my rapier to strike through." Why was she saying this? Because it got her away from the topic of Star risking herself for this woman. Not that Ellesandra thought the woman's life wasn't worth risking for, but STAR being the one to risk it wasn't what she wanted. "So, what is your plan then? To coat yourself in magic and simply walk in there, take her, and walk out?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a difficult smile at Ellesandra's words. On one hand, knowing they hardly even had to try made her feel a bit better that they hadn't been in danger. On the other, it made her wish the pirates would have seen sense all the more. Either way, she undid the magic on her arm, letting it disperse, then moved to the pond to cup some water her in her hand that she used to wipe the blood of her face, finally, before turning to her companion again. "I somehow doubt that is true, but I won't tempt fate by trying it if that is how it is," she said, clearly confident in her own abilities, but also wise enough to not let her desire to reassure Ellesandra take things to an extreme that might see her hurt. Apparently Star was capable of assessing risk after all. "Well, a little more than that. That part is just to ensure they can't hurt me. But if everything does go to plan, then I won't have to worry about anyone taking a swing at me in the first place." She realized she would need to justify those statements more, something she couldn't do in the meeting. She drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. "My magic is something called Auramancy. There have been some other magics by similar or identical names I've found in my travels, which I'm sure you can understand is frustrating. But mine, specifically, is concerned with the manipulation of auras, insofar as that applies to the energies that surround and permeate all living things. It's...Very difficult to make it all make sense in words. But with a little subtlety on my side, the hope is to sneak onto the ship with some discretion and use my powers to influence anyone on board into passivity. It's not very easy to do that if someone is already hostile, but...I am confident I can take a subtle approach that can avoid suspicion long enough to get to where Morrun's wife is being held. I know an arcane spell called Knock that will allow me to get her out of her cell, and once I have her, another spell called Dimension Door will carry us from the ship to the edge of the forest in an instant. That's why I was hoping you could be here, to ensure the landing space was safe. To ensure that we could have an expeditious getaway if there was an alarm. To...Deal with any pirates who swiftly ascended to challenge Morrun." Again, she seemed to have difficulty talking about the notion of killing, necessary as it might be. "A frontal assault is suicide, I know. But I can maintain my chromatic aura long enough to keep me safe if things go south, long enough to get me to his wife and out. It...does mean I imagine that sleeping at the inn no longer being an option is a foregone conclusion. But I am fine to sleep among the trees if it means saving an innocent woman. And I will know where she is held simply because I will be able to...See her distress." Well, that certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense at face value, now would it?

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned deeply at the explanation being provided. Even should Star be able to influence others that way, it was dangerous. And on that topic, was Star influencing her? Was that why her emotions were so reactive around Star? No, no Star had no idea about how her appearance and mannerisms effected her. Or how the Princess and Knight comment had effected her. At least, not WHY it had effected her. Ellesandra crossed her arms, eyeing Star for a moment. "That would explain your apparent empathy, I guess." If she could sense someone's aura, she could probably tell if someone was lying, couldn't she? It would probably make it particularly easy for her to be insightful, too. No wonder she'd been able to read Morrun like a book. Was that why she had kept looking at Ellesandra before? With a short nod, Ellesandra took a deep breath and let out a sigh. "Okay, I'll go meet up with Morrun and tell him we are going to get his gold, but want him to come meet us rather than carrying it into the city. I'm sure we'll have one or two people follow but the pirates probably won't assume he's ditching his wife. If any follow I'll take care of them." She glanced around at the woods, planning out where would be a good place to wait in trap, but continued talking while she did so. "Now, what is the plan if for some reason you can't get out? They have an anti-magic field or something?" She had to ask. Things happened, and she really didn't want to have to storm a ship to save Star due to lack of planning.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a soft smile. "I have been described as an empath before, yes. It's not a simple as just being able to know intrinsically if someone is lying to me, or if someone is holding out, or...Well, anything really. An aura is a complex thing. It's taken me a lifetime to be able to make as much sense of it as I can. My mother was leagues beyond my current capabilities, and is undoubtedly ever more so...If she still lives." Another sad smile. "As for the pirate ship, well...I would be able to tell rather swiftly if it was made of sussar bark, or if anti-magic was being used." A nuance to her power that Ellesandra might not yet understand, she surmised, so chose this moment to explain. She did say she owed them her honestly, after all. "You see I...The typical medium for my magic is sight. I see auras. I see emotion. Sometimes, that emotion carries memories. Sometimes, flickers of emotion linger like clouds that I can follow. Intense moments of the heart make the auras of those who experience them spike, and can leave remnants. I looked upon all the ships in port when we entered. I could see the auras of all the individuals on each of the ships, and lingering clouds on those which were abandoned. I would be able to feel the void of anti-magic if it was upon the ship as I approached and give me time and warning to leave earlier than expected. I will say I...don't expect them to have such things, but I admire your forward thinking." Another smile. "It...Means a lot to me that you are willing to support me in this. I already am the one who owes you, and yet you selflessly offer your aide yet again. I...Do not know how I will begin to repay you, but...Should you think of anything, I pledge to do all I can for all you've done and continue to do for me. Thank you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She SAW emotions? Was that why she kept looking at Ellesandra oddly? She hadn't been sure why, chocking it up to gratefulness, curiosity, or maybe even attraction, but seeing her emotions? Ellesandra was a very guarded individual with her emotions, she shared them with no one. The fact that Star could just slip past that guard and see them disturbed her. Not only that, but she thought about the strength of the emotions she'd been feeling in the past couple of hours. How Star reminded her of her Princess, and how that had thrown all of her guarded emotions everywhere. Typically she'd go weeks without letting herself feel them, but it seemed every other conversation with Star they were coming up based on the similarities. Had Star seen the memories associated with those emotions? Distrust sprung up in her and her jaw clenched, physically taking a step back from Star and clenching her fists. Ellesandra looked coiled, ready to spring into a fight or to escape at a moment's notice. She took every emotion she could currently feel and bundled it up, locking it in a box firmly and securely. She reined in every ounce of control she had to repress everything she was feeling, at least everything related to her past. She didn't answer the thanks at all, seemingly turning entirely business-focused. Reaching back into her pack, she slung it forward enough to pull out a hair tie and began pulling her hair up into a warrior's ponytail - how she typically wore it if she expected any chance at combat. "I'll ensure Morrun gets here." Her words were clipped, edging on harsh. There was anger in her tone, but it was being tightly controlled. "Should anything go wrong and you can't get here, make some sort of sign in the sky. I'll look out for it."

Star Lumina
Star was an insightful enough woman to know that what she was admitting might provoke a poor reaction. She wanted to be open an honest, but she knew honesty came with its pitfalls. It was curious that what flicked the switch was her being able to see them, rather than sense them. That was the admission that saw Ellesandra retreat into themselves, at least; Star had long gone beyond finding such things coincidental in her travels. People could wear masks. People could fight their emotions. But even Ellesandra's attempts to embrace the utmost stoicism would prove futile. Emotions were wild and untamed. Uncontrollable at their core. One could resist them. One needn't be ruled by them. But they still clung to the aura. Focusing one's mind on a task had some effect, but Ellesandra's guilt was so overbearing that force of will could not repress it. Not that it changed anything. Star had been seeing it for hours now. She similarly could see the anger, the distrust. That it wounded Star was obvious. Her bright, open, honest self being rejected by this woman who saved her did hurt, and the way her eyes grew heavy and drift to the ground between them made it clear. Ellesandra might fight to keep themselves stoic, but...Star was as easy and plain to read as ever. She said nothing in response. She simply nodded twice to the order, then silently walked past Ellesandra and began back towards the city, leaving the knight to take care of Morrun.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the distance grow between them. Saw the disappointment in Star's eyes and how she'd looked down to the ground. The hurt at Ellesandra's distrust and anger was evident. Why the fuck did she feel guilty over that? She reminded herself that Star had invaded her privacy, it was like reading a mind. Sure maybe Star didn't exactly have an option; Ellesandra didn't know if she could turn the sight off. But it still felt like she'd been betrayed, somehow. That Star had seen past things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone; that her defenses had failed her. Hell, it her defenses were probably all but useless in front of Star's magic. She needed to finish this job - even if she wasn't getting paid, it was a job - and then get away from Star. It was dangerous having someone who could see her emotions like that, emotions Ellesandra hadn't let herself process and had no desire to talk about. There was a moment where Ellesandra watched Star walk off, eyes scanning either side of the road to ensure that there wasn't any danger down Star's path. She waited until she could no longer see Star, to ensure she'd made it that far safely at least, before heading back towards the town herself. She made for a direct path with the tavern again, her real anger being used to glare down anyone who so much as looked her way with interest. Passing those who had catcalled them before, she gave them an icy stare that all but challenged them to try something or say something again. She wanted an outlet for her anger, even if she knew that was stupid, unnecessary, and wouldn't help. She wasn't some reckless boy who got angry and stormed through the town making it everyone else's problem. She was a disciplined, well trained knight and bodyguard. It didn't mean that temptation wasn't there, though. When she made it to the tavern, she did a quick sweep of the patrons again, making note of those who had obviously been part of the pirate group before and where they were located, and then searching for Morrun. Hopefully he hadn't gotten himself in trouble while they'd walked out to make plans.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The two had not been gone long at all. That, in itself, had a few raised eyebrows. Some...Expectant ones. From the catcallers to the tavern-dwellers, they weren't quite smart enough to pick up that something was wrong, but they sure did find it a tiny bit odd. Odd enough to think on it for a few seconds, then return to their steins of ale. It was surely someone else's problem to sort out. Morrun, meanwhile, had collected his things and looked like there was a spring sitting under his seat. The company this tavern provided gave him no delights, and he was eager to be rid of them. Star, meanwhile, moved through the city towards the docks. No signs of distress or alarm could be heard on the air, so, so far everything was going to plan. Morrun looked at Ellesandra with hope, eagerly awaiting instruction.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced once more at the pirates around the tavern, to ensure they weren't about to get up and make any moves or anything foolish. Once she was confident that they were staying out of the way, at least for now, she looked back to Morrun, who seemed over excited. "Come. I'm not foolish enough to carry that type of money into what could have been an elaborate ploy to rob us. You'll meet us and provide the service we are paying exorbitant fees for, and then you can take that money back for this ransom." She dropped her voice, still loud enough for most in the tavern to hear but playing it off as if she were grumbling to herself and it wasn't intended for others to hear. "My Lady apparently has deeper pockets than she does sense." Ellesandra was trying to play up that she knew this was a stupid thing to pay for, and more money than appropriate. That would be suspicious to the pirates, certainly. But if she were playing it as if her employer was simply a bleeding heart rich noble who didn't care about the cost. It would potentially place a target on Star's back later, but if things went according to plan Star wouldn't be here long enough for that to matter. She stepped to the side and motioned Morrun towards the door, not letting him follow behind or anything. "I'll lead you up to where we're camped currently. You'll get to see the gold, but you are not to touch it until you've provided her the service. Understood?"


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Y-Yes, understood, understood!" said Morrun, eagerly jumping up. The pirates had a few laughs at his expense, which he scowled at, but rose above and moved forward to walk towards the entrance. One of the pirates then also stood. One wearing a long black coat. Scimitar was in its sheath, but the handle clearly visible. The man bore a scar over one green eye and had a red bandana over his hair, and was clean shaven unlike most of the others. "I think I'll join you," the man brazenly said. "See about where you're camped. Can't risk our ah...Legitimate business transaction going and walking away from us now can we?" Suspicion hadn't been breached yet, but this man, of seemingly higher rank, but discernibly not the captain of this crew, saw fit to throw his weight around a little. They had clearly operated with impunity thus far, and the brazen confidence that made the other pirates sloppy fighters similarly was making this man - presumably a first mate - feel bold enough to invite himself along for the walk. "Come on lads, two of ya get off your plump asses and take a walk, could use it to sober up a little and get back to work when we get back, eh? Captain's gonna want to haul ass outta 'ere once we have ourselves a little spending spree at the conclusion of this transaction." At his remarks, two of the other pirates rose off their stools, cursing under their breath and just slightly unsteady in their gait, to join the first mate. The first mate then motioned to the door for Ellesandra, wearing the most smug grin he possibly could.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked back towards the pirate, obviously someone of more influence than the base crew, and a frown creased her face. Her eyes narrowed and she looked the man up and down. "You expect me to let you come near my Lady, armed, while she has gold prepared for a transaction? Criminals of your level do not respect honor, so don't give me your word or anything." Her left hand moved over to rest on the hilt of her rapier on her hip. It was a subtle threat, but not one that she was actively making. "If you must come, you will wait back from the camp. You may be within eyesight, but I will not tolerate you approaching." Ellesandra was calling upon every bit of her knightly confidence and authority. She wasn't tall by any means; likely most of those in the tavern would stand much taller than her 5'1 height. However, she had the presence of someone much bigger than she actually was, a confidence of a trained soldier and one that would not be afraid to fight her way out of something. She was drawing what would be considered a normally appropriate boundary for the safety of her Lady, without outright refusing the Pirate. Hopefully, the pirate wouldn't let his confidence push past that.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirate placed his hands on his hips and smirked. "Or wha? You gonna prick me with your needle, pipsqueak? Oughta be a wench servin' up ale in 'ere rather than tryin' t' lay down the law," he said, then nudged his pirate mate with his elbow. "Ey, get a load o' 'iss lass, tryna' tell us how it is, eyy?" he said, sharing a chuckle with his mates as they collectively bathed in their misogyny they found so hilarious. "Pff, whatever you say, 'muh lady'," he said in as mocking a tone as he could. "We won't trample on your pretty posies, just make quick of it, yeah? Any funny business and I'm sure the captain won't have any qualms tripling the er, ah...Protection fee we're charging." His arms crossed over his chest here, sporting a smug stance as he towered over the shorter knight by an entire foot. He wasn't nice about it, but it seemed Ellesandra's demands were being heeded. A need to enforce his pride and power in front of his mates balanced by...Perhaps a desire to not upset the captain by screwing things up, and thus, the concession was given. "Lead on, proud knight, to your little fairy garden with all its shiny little coins, yeah?"


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra ignored the misogyny. All that mattered to her was that he'd agreed to it. The threat about tripling the protection fee was ignored, since they weren't actually going to be paying it anyways. Ellesandra considered encouraging him to go first, rather than turning her back to him and walking through. She didn't want to, but she didn't think he'd go along with that if she demanded it. "As you wish. Unfortunately, my Lady has gold, but not the necessary remove curse spells to fix whatever is going on with your face, if that's what you're hoping to find." With a smirk, she stood to the side as she opened the door, then closed it behind her as she stepped through. He might stop the door from closing, but by then she'd have stepped out, to the side and where she could keep an eye on him while walking forward. There was no attempt to stop him, or the others he'd brought with him, from following. Instead, she motioned for Morrun to continue forward and eyeing the pirates and, as long as they didn't start a fight, would begin leading them out towards the forest where she'd chatted with Star.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The man didn't find the joke funny. It was risky. Getting the jab in nearly had the man luging in response. One of his mates was stepping forward, only to have the first mate plant his hand on the lesser pirate's chest. "Easy lad. We get the money first, then we can show the lil' pipsqueak here what a cursed face looks like. See how inspiring she is in that armor with that ugly mug cut to ribbons, yeah?" he said, quietly to his mate, but loud enough to ensure Ellesandra heard him. Assuming that didn't set the knight off in turn, the men followed. When exiting, Ellesandra would be able to see Star - her dress didn't exactly make her subtle - as she was boarding the ship. Seemed she got past anyone on the docks without a hitch. Some pirates approached Star when she boarded. It was too far to hear anything or make out details, but whatever it was that was said seemed good enough for the deck hands who let her pass. She then disappeared to the bowels of the ship while one of the deck hands made their way to what could be presumed to be the captain's quarters. The first mate and his merry band of drunkards were right behind Ellesandra and Morrun, who at this point looked stressed enough to have a heart attack right in front of the knight. His pack was on his back, and he walked with rigidity to his gait. The group would be able to make it to wherever Ellesandra led them, however there would be some expectation of results once the group arrived from the three pirates.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond to the threat. She shouldn't have made the jab, in all honesty, but there was something about how he'd insulted Star that was still bothering her. When Ellesandra noticed Star getting aboard the pirate ship, she made sure not to watch the ship directly. No, she kept an eye out of her peripheral vision to ensure Star got on without difficulty, but otherwise pointed up towards where they were going to ensure the pirate's attention was on her and their destination, no straying eyes back to potentially see what Star was doing. "We've made camp just over the ridge up there, into the forest. That's our destination." She made her way, not looking at the pirates at all other than keeping them within sight to ensure they didn't try to backstab her or anything. When the crested the ridge and looked into the woods, Ellesandra touched Morrun's arm and motioned to a copse of trees. "We're camped just past those trees. Why don't you go speak with her and start whatever magical detection you're doing while I have a chat with our friends here?" She wanted to ensure morrun was at least a few steps away before any fighting began. She had also been sure to place herself between Morrun and the men when she said this. If they tried to reach for him, they'd have to reach past her first - which even if they thought she was a weak woman would be stupid to do. Her gaze cut to the pirates with a firm look. "As I said before, i don't trust them near my Lady."


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirates seemed more or less indifferent to the goings-on, eager only to get their payday, and not do anything that would mess it up. So, despite some mocking smirks from the first mate, he was content to stuff his hands in his pockets and whistle to himself, rising up to his tip toes and falling back down again. Morrun of course heeded Ellesandra's words and moved away into the forest. Obviously, not finding Star, he understood what was happening and made sure to stay out of sight somewhere nearby. He was ready to start chanting magical nonsense to fool the pirates if needed, but he hoped to simply remain out of sight. Then it was just...A waiting game. The pirates were passive, but expectant. They wouldn't wait forever. And they certainly would know something was up the moment Star showed up, since Star was apparently over with Morrun doing weird magic stuff while Ellesandra stood guard. Star was certainly hard at work...And no signal in the sky just yet. So it was Ellesandra's moment to either bide their time, or make a move.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had no intention of waiting for Star. She wanted these pirates dealt with both in case Star did signal that Ellesandra was needed, and before Star returned so that she wouldn't be in danger during the fight. Ellesandra waited, back to the brushes and facing the pirates passively for a few moments, giving Morrun plenty of time to head in and find somewhere to hide, away from danger. She gave herself to a silent count of thirty before she withdrew her rapier. "You have the option of returning to town now and keeping your lives, or fighting and dying. Your choice." She was sure her drawing her rapier had put them on edge, but she hadn't attacked; not at first. She held the rapier in front of her, right foot going back and sinking down into a proper fighting stance. She didn't use magic, based on how unskilled the previous pirates had been. The two drunk ones she wasn't worried about at all; the more authoritative one might possess some skill, but she wasn't dropping her guard. She could always add magic if needed later.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The moment Ellesandra reached for her rapier, the first mate drew his sword. He had clearly been just as ready for a fight, though that message didn't make it to his two lightly inebriated comrades. They had a few seconds before they joined in the fight as well. The two circled around either of Ellesandra's flanks, leaving them surrounded. A familiar fighting position. "...Way I sees it, there's three of us and one of you," began the first mate. "So I thank 'ye, for giving me the chance I was itchin' for to pay you back for all that holier-than-thou bullshit you carried in on your boots the moment you set foot in our turf," he said, venom dripping from his words. Not that it was any surprise, but they weren't going to pull punches now that they had been given reason to fight. And if Ellesandra hadn't already started the fight, the three of them rushed in all at once, coordinating their attack to all strike from different angles at, more or less, the same time, aiming to chop at any part of Ellesandra not covered by armor.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"I guess I'll do to you what I did to your friends out on the road, then." She had timed the comment specifically to potentially throw them off when they planned to attack, but whether or not it worked she didn't wait to see. As they all began to attack, she quickly pivoted towards one of the drunkards the movement itself dodged two blades, and her own moved up to knock the other away. She went for the same killing blow she'd had on the others, a slice into the throat and pull out. Ellesandras movements were fluid, not stopping whether or not she'd hit. She'd used the movement to create distance between herself and the others, ducking from where she'd been surrounded into where she could face them all, and quickly stepping into the other drunkard with an attempt to do the same to him. They were the easy targets, and she could use fancy footwork to avoid the only sober one of them until his two companions were taken care of. That was her plan, anyways.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The footwork of the knight was far and above the three pirates. The two lackeys had no chance. Their swings were filled with arrogance and confidence, even in the wake of the comment about Ellesandra felling two others. The first ate Ellesandra's rapier in the neck, paralyzed by the attack as he was left to bleed out once the rapier was withdrawn. The distance was too short, however, for the action to keep Ellesandra out of harm's way. The other lackey's sword went wide, but the first mate had clearly seen his share of sorties. Enough that the strike to his underling presented him an opportunity to swing horizontal across Ellesandra's thighs. The metal bit into flesh. Shallow wounds, not enough to impede Ellesandra, but torn fabric and the first droplets of crimson from the knight at the hands of these criminals was spilled. His follow up was to backhand his own other, living lackey, which saved the man's neck from the thrust of the rapier by inches as he reeled back just before Ellesandra could thrust. He might be a criminal, but he clearly had some sense, even if it came with callousness towards his men. He didn't seem fazed that the other died. With the initial engagement sorted, Ellesandra then found the remaining two pirates staring her down. Hesitation, and fear rose in the first mate, as if surprised the knight was...Exactly who they claimed to be. But rather than charge in head on again, the first mate produced a glass bottle of some sort filled with crackling energy and swiftly hurled it at Ellesandra's feet. The bottle shattered on impact, exploding into a cloud of thick smoke that obscured the battlefield. The smoke stung at Ellesandra's eyes and throat, but a knight like her would find the crude trick was not up to the staunch fortitude she possessed. Some coughing and watering eyes aside, it wouldn't be able to daze her as the pirates expected it might; however, it did still obscure vision, and thus needed reliance on sound. The charges were staggered; the lackey first, with the first mate a few steps behind. Given his previous attack, it seemed he might be counting on Ellesandra to attack the first available target, then use the chance to run them through, which is precisely what they would attempt to do if Ellesandra played their game. Of course, the obscuring smoke went both ways. So there was no guarantee Ellesandra was even where they expected her to be in the seconds between the smoke engulfing the battlefield and the charge starting.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had let out a silent curse at feeling the blade slice at her thighs. Perhaps she should have gone ahead and used magic to ensure easy victory. Still, they didn't really enjoy the idea of the lethargy that hit them after using their haste spell, and their other magic was more focused against magic users. Ellesandra was frowning as she faced the remaining two pirates, a little impressed with the first mate slapping his companion out of the way of her strike. Well, that just meant she wouldn't be able to go for the quick, easy death for them then. As the man slammed the bottle onto the ground and smoke pillowed out, Ellesandra quickly backpeddled. No use standing in smoke that was stinging at her eyes and throat, though she did her best to remain silent while doing so and to take careful steps back so she didn't fall backwards. As such, she was not where they believed her to be when attacking. In fact, she had begun circling around, looking for movement as she did so, making her way around where the smoke was billowing. It would start spreading out soon, allowing visibility again, but when it did Ellesandra was standing on the other side of where she had been before. Her free hand was up, partially covering her mouth and nose to filter any of the smoke a little more, and as soon as she could see one of them well enough to strike, she did. The goal was to strike before they got their whereabouts back, whichever one she struck, and this time she was aiming straight at the person's chest.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a calm that fell over the battlefield as Ellesandra retreated and circled the smoke plume. Their attempts to be stealthy were hampered by the heavy armor they wore; the clacking of the metal even when moving slowly made enough noise against the dead quiet of the forest to keep a vague location in mind. From within the smoke, there was nothing at first. Then... "Wh-- Hey! What are you doing ya maddie-- WHOAAAA!" From within the smoke cloud, the lower ranking pirate sailed through the air at Ellesandra, having been thrown at her with quite an impressive toss that had the lackey sailing like a cannonball at the knight. As unconventional as strategies came, and an absolute epitome of pirate tactics. No honour among thieves, and no care for each other's lives either it seemed. But the opening provided was slim, so whether Ellesandra took the bait and killed the man in flight, only to be braced or toppled by the impact, or rolled out of the way, the first mate was right behind, ready to stab clear through his ally to get at the knight, or take advantage of her lowered guard to thrust at whatever space he could see that wasn't armored.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't forgotten the noise she made, but when there was movement and confusion in the smoke, she had been hoping the noise wasn't easy to follow. Still, she had NOT expected one of the pirates to be THROWN at her. She did not take the easy stab it provided, instead dodging to the side, which allowed her to see the first mate coming in behind his companion who had been thrown at her. She stepped up towards him while his companion sailed past to her right, feinting a stab towards his neck like he would expect her to take. She kept her guard up, planning to either reach forward and grab him if he tried to move out of the way, or to quickly stab lower if he moved his blade up to block it.

Star Lumina
Indeed, the lackey sailed past, rolling around as he hit the ground. The first mate reacted, seeing the knight rolled out of the way. Arrogance once more proved to be the man's downfall, however, as he expected to still have the upper hand. By the time Ellesandra had readied their attack, the first mate had already jumped into the air and was ready to descend upon her with a stab at her neck. But in the contest of knight vs first mate, his attack would prove the more easily dodged. A swift adjustment to the side is all Ellesandra would need to do to avoid his thrust, and all she had to do otherwise was hold her rapier out for the man to skewer himself upon.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked up upon the first mate swinging towards her. His attack was extremely choreographed, easily read. She slid beneath his attack, right hand out to catch him and rapier tilted up so that as he fell, he would fall upon her blade. She caught him as he skewered himself, hand gripping onto his chest and shoving him backwards just as soon as he landed upon her sword to avoid him trying to go for any suicidal attacks either. Ellesandra stayed mobile, quickly hopping backwards after shoving him off of her blade, and glancing between him and the pirate he had thrown for any signs of movement or hostility remaining. The sting of the cuts on her thighs increased a little at this movement, but in the adrenaline of a fight it was at the very back of her mind.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra would find the other pirate had worked his way up to his feet, stumbling. The first mate wheezed and coughed up blood as one lung filled with blood where he had been punctured. He would die in the next minute or so. The other pirate, realizing he had been all but sacrificed by his crew, and seeing two of said crew laying dead on the floor, saw no reason to swear fealty to this band of pirates any longer. He kept his weapon on him, but as Ellesandra was throwing the first mate to the ground, he was hurriedly running away into the forest, away from Cloverport, through the trees to the west. She could run after him, and likely catch him with ease. But there was no immediate threat to the plan as he ran. All his allies were back to the south, and if he intended on circling around, it would likely be too little, too late. It was about this time, as well, that a surge of mana appeared in the form of a bright blue archway that opened with crackling energy. Through it, Star and an elven woman shot forward, with a flash of light streaking from the port city to the magical doorway that saw the two of them briefly encased in bright white light before they landed, sure on their feet. Star was fully surrounded by that brilliant, rainbow energy. The sort she said would only be needed if she was in danger, as it would stop any blades from hurting her. So it seemed, not everything went perfectly to plan, and there was cause enough to defend herself. She was, thankfully, in one piece. But she also looked out of breath; doubtlessly, she was pushing herself to the limits of her mana. The radiant, rainbow energy dissipated off her, returning her to her natural state, and she then doubled over, braced on her knees, to catch her breath.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched as the other pirate ran off. She only watched for a few moments, keeping an eye on the direction he was going as well as if he was making any motion to come back and surprise her. Meanwhile she turned her gaze down to the first mate, reaching forward and pushing her rapier through his throat to make his death quicker and easier. No need to have him sputtering on the ground from gut wound; those were never fun. When the magical portal appeared Ellesandra's head snapped up, going into another fighting stance with a brief wince at the cut the pirate had gotten on the back of her thighs. It was apparent that the people coming through it were not pirates though, and after watching to ensure they hadn't been followed or anything, she straightened and leaned down, cleaning the blood off her blade with the pirates shirt. "Your Husband is back in the woods there." She pointed in the direction for the woman that Ellesandra assumed was his wife, sheathing her sword while straightening and looking back to the ladies. There was concern that shot up when seeing Star doubled over breathing heavily, but she didn't approach. There was also a little bit of shame at having let one of the pirates wound her, even if it had been a minor wound, and distrust was still apparent in regards to Star's ability to simply see past her emotional guards. Ellesandra reached for her pack, pulling out the necessary bandages and clothes to begin treating her own wounds. "Were either of you hurt?"

The elven woman was wearing a matching wedding band to her husband, along with an emerald engagement ring to pair with it. She had similar complexion to him and soft black hair that made her bright green eyes stand out against her freckled face. "T-Thank you! Thank you!" she said, on the edge of tears. Red markings adorned the elven woman's wrists in the shape of manacles, and similar red marks from what was likely rope or cloth were on her cheeks in line with her mouth. That she attempted to break free from her captivity was as obvious as the mistreatment she endured. The woman ran in the direction noted, and the two could be heard speaking after a few moments as they came together, inaudible from the distance. Star looked at Ellesandra with concern upon noticing their wounds. Her arms were trembling as she strained to keep herself stable, with sweat visible on her brow. Quite a bit of strain she endured, it seemed. "N-No, the...Captain...Came after me. Definitely tried to kill me, but I was ready for it," she said, offering as reassuring a smile as she could given her fatigue. "I can only assume he will be riling up the pirates left in the city, so we should be...Anywhere that isn't here right now. I'm sorry." She willed herself up to her feet and began to walk, still clearly short of breath. If Star's intuition was correct, the group would have a limited time frame to escape before the wide search party began to track them down. Long enough that they needn't set off sprinting...But not long enough for anyone to truly relax and prepare for the road ahead.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond to the elven woman, letting her go off and reconnect with her husband for a moment. She took that moment to pull out a small flask of alcohol and pour on the cuts she gained, clenching her teeth at the burning feeling, and then quickly beginning to wrap them up and bandage them. They weren't deep or bad enough to need more than that, a simple disinfect and wrap up to help them clot and stop bleeding. When she was done, she straightened up entirely again from the awkward position she'd been leaning to reach her own thighs, looking Star up and down to confirm she was telling the truth in regards to being fine. Nodding to confirm she at least didn't seem injured, just fatigued, Ellesandra walked up and offered her arm, in case Star was so fatigued she needed the support. "You're right. Plus, one of the pirates who followed us here ran off. I don't know that he'll go back and tell his men, but there's a possibility, which means we'll have less time than we thought. Should get your contact and his wife ready to go." Ellesandra wasn't unused to needing to move quickly, especially after a skirmish. She did glance behind her briefly at the town to see if anyone had seen them or were moving directly towards them, but beyond keeping an eye out she was just focused on getting them moving away. Pirates likely didn't have much experience tracking over land, at least she hoped they didn't, and she had plenty of experience disguising tracks. She just needed to get further away from the city to make it worth it.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked at Ellesandra's arm. There was an unexpected moment of...Decision in that. As if there was more to grabbing the offered arm than precisely just that. A flash of pain, or perhaps guilt, came over Star's face. She gave the most polite declining gesture she could, offering a smile along with the raised palm to try and assure them that she was okay. She was unsteady as she began moving to do as asked, so it might seem a peculiar decision to decline the help. Regardless, she moved to the husband and wife. "I'm sorry, both of you, but we had best be clear of this place. We should be going now, and we can talk when we're safe." Her words were not alarmist, just stating the matter at hand. The two nodded. "R-Right," began Morrun. "The elvish settlement I'm from isn't terribly far. A day's walk north-west along the main roads, we could arrive by midnight if we take the forest path," he explained, looking to Star and Ellesandra for a decision on the matter. It seemed simple, but Star still looked at Ellesandra. Obviously the knight couldn't stay here, and finding their way to a new place with a warm bed and armed guards to deter any pirates would be safest. But she also couldn't rule out the fact that Ellesandra might be feeling pushed at this point. First it was saving Star, then just to the city, then roped into helping these two...Star didn't hold judgement in her eyes, and could hardly blame them if they wanted to take this chance to walk their own path.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned when Star refused her help, but then proceeded to walk unsteadily towards the couple. She considered reaching out and taking her arm forcefully to help, but held back from doing so. Star was a grown ass woman and if she decided she didn't want help, Ellesandra was not going to push it on her. She followed behind, glancing towards the Morrun when he confirmed there was an elvish settlement not far from here. The look from Star was ignored; while Ellesandra technically had a choice, she really didn't. She wasn't going to leave these three to go find their own way. "Do the pirates know about this settlement? If they do, they may be expecting you to go that way and already be looking or tracking in that area. We may want to take a roundabout path to avoid such, but if you don't think they know, straight path there is likely the quickest and safest. I can follow a bit behind and throw the trail off." She'd learned in her training how to create false tracks and hide real ones. It was important, knowing how to throw a pursuer or kidnapper off the trail. She'd be a bit behind them so they were more exposed if they did get attacked while she was doing it, but if they waited until they were a safe enough distance away from the town they could cut down on the risk of that happening pretty substantially.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"It's not on any maps, and it is guiled in illusory magic. I doubt they know. It's not...Impossible, but I'd never assume a meat-headed pirate would be capable of finding such a place. But even if they did, the hunters of Lea'taas would see arrows in their eyes long before they reached the walls. It will be safe there, I promise," he said, a look of genuine appreciation on his face. There were few in the world who would be so kind as to do what Star and Ellesandra did, fewer still who would do so after discovering that Morrun's initial intent was to deceive the pair of them into paying an extortionary amount of money for information that was nowhere near worth the amount asked. The gratitude of he and his wife was clear. There was no trace of dishonesty to be found. Star, as well, in all her insight and power, did not signal that she saw anything but honesty in the man. "Besides. We are ahead of them now, and can remain so if we leave immediately. They were all in Cloverport. I heard talk of them sailing out within the week for another city further down the coast. They won't be roaming these wilds; there's nothing of value to thieves like them to be found for miles." Aside from the elven settlement, of course, but as established it was extremely unlikely the pirates even knew that existed unless told about it. With all said, Star nodded to Ellesandra's words. "I'll take the lead with Morrun, then, in case danger comes from the front," said Star, still winded, and taking much longer than one might expect to catch her breath. "I-I...I'll alert you of any danger while y-you...You cover our tracks. But we should...Should move." Still breathing heavily, Star gestured for Morrun to take the lead, following him with his wife keeping close behind the two. Star watched over her shoulder at Ellesandra. Partly just to ensure they were coming, but also just...More of that curious gaze of hers, this time paired with a somewhat worried look in her eyes.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded to what Morrun said. That was enough to convince her heading straight there was the right move. When Star suggested she'd take the lead in case they were attacked from the front, however, Ellesandra frowned. Their gaze raked over Star once again, searching for a wound. Was she simply that winded from keeping her magical armor up and then doing the portal? That would be understandable, especially considering the light magic she'd done just earlier, but that also meant she was probably on her last leg stamina wise. Fighting anyone who came from the front wouldn't be ideal for her. The concern was evident, even without Star being able to see the emotion itself. The concern was directly tethered to the guilt and sorrow, a fear creeping out that the past would be repeated. Ellesandra almost said something, to stop them while she covered tracks, but she held back. She was being ridiculous. She followed behind them for a bit, not immediately parting ways to hide their tracks. The thing was, if the pirates found their initial tracks that would be good; plus they couldn't exactly hide the blood and bodies of the other pirates easily. And if the one who escaped said anything, trying to hide their tracks on that ridge was pointless. No, they needed to start off in their actual direction for a bit, and only after doing so would Ellesandra drop back silently and without comment to begin covering where their tracks actually went, and redirecting them to the road that they had originally come from and where Ellesandra had encountered Star and the pirates originally. She took a branch and swept the dirt and ground to cover where they had walked, then walked in another direction, making multiple sets of tracks using different weight in each step so unless someone really looked closely they wouldn't notice it was the same person.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Whether Ellesandra's methods would be useful at deterring any followers would remain unknown for the immediate future. The only way to know for sure that the deception succeeded was to never hear from the pirates again. A favourable outcome, but there would certainly be that lingering uncertainty that they might harbour a vendetta. It was equally likely they would get drunk, throw up, and forget this ever happened. Time would tell. For now, the forward march began. Star hadn't seemed injured when looking at her. There was blood on her dress, but that was the same blood as what was on her dress from before their rescue mission. The blood from her cheek. Just small dots on the otherwise pristine silks. The concern on Ellesandra's face made Star smile in response. To reassure, or genuinely because she felt happy to know Ellesandra was concerned for her? Difficult to say, but a smile she maintained. "Are you sure you can keep walking? Do you need to stop and rest?" asked Morrun to Star. She shook her head. "Nnh, I can press onward. We can rest when we're safe," came her reply. Despite this, Morrun still offered her his waterskin, which she did accept. Her arms shook slightly when drinking the water, but she clearly needed it from how much she drank from it. Time would pass. Hours of walking, interrupted by short rests now and then. Star did eventually catch her breath in this time, and there was little to do beyond walk the road and the forested path they eventually moved into with an eye for any dangers. Wild animals could be seen, but the prey animals ran and if there were any predator animals? They certainly stayed out of sight. It was a welcome reprieve from the dangers of Cloverport for Star, but despite the rests, despite the water, despite the time...She still had clear exhaustion in her gait. She kept up, but Ellesandra was certainly correct that she was in no shape to fight. She was barely in shape to walk.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The smile did little to reassure Ellesandra that Star was actually okay. She'd seen plenty of people smile through pushing themselves too hard. When Ellesandra rejoined them, her eyes once again scanned Star up and down to see how she was holding up before focusing on their surroundings to look out for a trap or sign anyone had caught up with them. The water was a good thing to be offered to Star, and she had nodded to Morrun in thanks when he had done so. As she stepped up to walk alongside the group, she looked over to the Elven woman, obviously injured. "Will these scouts from the elven encampment have any issue with Miss Lumina or my presence? And Miss-" This time, it was directed at Morrun's wife. "Do you have any injuries they gave you that need treated right now? It would be pointless to get there if you were hiding an infected whip cut or anything that's going to hurt more to wait." She was relatively confident that she'd bought them a little bit of time with her tracks, assuming they were even following them. That wasn't guaranteed, but it was a strong possibility depending on how upset the captain had been. Now, it was just a matter of if they unluckily stumbled across any on the road, like Star had previously.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"A-Ah, I'm Lissana. Lissana Dayflower," said the elven woman, her voice meek but pleasant. "A-And, n-no, just..." she looked at her wrists. "The restraints. Maybe some bruising from when they threw me around," she said, gratitude in her eyes for Ellesandra's concern. "Some of the pirates were making...You know...C-Comments...A-About d-doing..." She cut herself off, one hand grabbing the other arm. A look of fear washed over her; blood drained from her face. "...I-It's good you showed up when you did, let's say," she said, clearly eager to conclude the matter. No tears were visible on her clothing from flogging or similar. Morrun naturally looked plenty disgusted upon hearing his wife recount such things, but he paused in his stride to let her move beside him so he could loop an arm around his beloved. "You're safe now," Morrun said to his wife, earning a nod. Then, another appreciative smile to Ellesandra. It was because of the knight and the mystic that he could say that with confidence, of course. Star didn't interject, but she looked over her shoulder at the exchange. First with sympathetic sorrow at Lissana, obviously holding nothing but dread at what might have been. But then a calm comfort, knowing they were okay. Battered, surely. Scared? Undoubtedly. But the worst was avoided. She could take comfort in having acted without hesitation and preventing tragedy. Though it seemed at this point she was pushing herself too hard; one leg gave out as she stepped, causing her to drop to one knee. She caught herself on her hands planting on the soft earth, then remained in this position for a moment, lightly trembling as she slowly, steadily tried to work back up to her feet.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Anger flashed through Ellesandra at Lissana's words. Her jaw clenched, but she forcibly relaxed it so that she didn't intimidate the elven woman. Rather than saying anything else, she let Morrun move in to comfort her. Best to come from her husband than some strange armored woman, anyways. She heard a shuffle up front and quickly looked back that way to see Star having fallen to one knee. Without a second of hesitation, Ellesandra jaunted forward quickly, ignoring the sting of pain coming from her own wound at the quick and sudden movement. In just a moment she'd found herself leaning over Star, reaching forward and placing a hand on Star's back to ensure she at least had support there. Her other hand was offered to Star to help her back up, a mixture of concern for Star's stamina and irritation at her pushing herself and refusing help coming up. It also pinged some of the grief, a reminder of someone else, but only Star would be able to see that with her ~Special Eyes~. "If you refuse help again, Miss Lumina, you only get one more chance. If you fall again, I will throw you over my shoulder and haul you the rest of the way back." The threat was made with absolute intention. It was a promise more than anything else, an acknowledgment that Star was setting a boundary about not wanting help and that Ellesandra would respect that for now, but if it happened again that boundary wouldn't matter.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The moment Ellesandra placed their hand on Star's back, the reason for her refusal to take Ellesandra's arm prior would come into much greater context. The physical touch evoked a connection. A spark of something that flowed up Ellesandra's arm. Like a wave of serene, beautiful water, it cascaded over Ellesandra's figure, bathing them in calm. In serenity. Inner peace. Of course, this came at odds with Ellesandra's own turmoil. It was not something that controlled or overrode Ellesandra's own emotion. It was simply...Comfort. Like a final exhale after hours-long frustration. Like finally being able to sit after marching for a week straight. It was...Soothing. And with that soothing feeling came an innate understanding. A recognition of the source. It was Star. Her aura touched Ellesandra when they touched her. It was not an unpleasant feeling. Quite the opposite in fact. But whether Ellesandra's hand lingered or removed swiftly would determine what followed. In the instant, at least, Star looked over her shoulder from her lowered position, up at Ellesandra, with worry in her eyes. Worry that she'd see the same closure, the same walls rising, the same...Distance from Ellesandra she saw before, as if Star was ashamed of her powers in the company of the knight.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra seemed to jump at the feeling of calm that poured through the touch. Her jaw clenched and she all but flinched away at first, finally understanding why Star had refused. There was another spike of irritation, but also...acceptance. Ellesandra wasn't going to let Star stumble the rest of the way. There was obvious displeasure, even just on her face, but she reached forward ant took Star's arm, ignoring the calm that came through the touch and working to pull Star into a standing position again. She maintained contact, her arm moving to wrap around Star's back and hold onto her, ensuring that Star could put the majority of her weight on Ellesandra if she needed it. If not, Ellesandra would simply help her balance as she walked. There were no words; she didn't need to say how uncomfortable she was with how Star's power was influencing her emotions. Even with the calming effect, her distrust and displeasure with it seemed to rise at first. Of course, if Star allowed longer contact that would go away, not enough to truly fight against any constant flow of calm, but for now - there was no way Star would miss that Ellesandra wasn't happy, but willing, to maintain contact here.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star didn't, couldn't resist the hold on her arm the helped her up. She desperately needed it. Her weight instinctively leaned upon Ellesandra, clinging to them for support. The sustained hold did bring with it more; the longer the hold remained, the more Ellesandra would be able to feel what Star felt. Star of course was able to see what Ellesandra felt. But the touch seemed to bridge that connection further, to some degree. It wasn't as intense - not that Ellesandra could know - with this passive touch. But Ellesandra would be able to feel Star's exhaustion. Not as their own. But an innate understanding of what Star felt. A knowing that one couldn't put into words. How every step was labourous. How pain shot up her legs with each footfall. Star had pushed herself beyond her limits, as much was obvious. It had physical ramifications. Things she was clearly able to push past...To some degree. That she hadn't been wincing or whining in pain was a miracle; her control over her own emotions was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite significant. But she could not overcome the limits of her body, try as she might. Gratitude welled in her heart for Ellesandra, and Ellesandra could feel it intrinsically. The feelings did not pass onto the knight from within, nor did they require any effort to keep separated from their own emotion. The knight's guilt, their irritation, all of their own emotions remained as their own. And if the knight truly wanted, they would have no issues resisting the bond. Rejecting the sensations that flowed into them. Denying it all from influencing them would be trivial. It was not an invasive feeling. It was simply a calm, affectionate zephyr blowing through a window into Ellesandra's soul; the window would take no effort to close, even if the sensation was novel. Among the other things Star felt, if Ellesandra chose to open their heart and accept them, was...Guilt. Sadness. Loneliness. Longing. Determination. Some happiness, though it was coiled in a tumultuous storm of nuance and more complex feelings. All of this, without a lifetime of experience to decipher it, would be...Troublesome to make much sense of. To follow the threads of emotion and find their roots. The why for any given emotion was a mystery. But that the emotion was there was plain as day. And deeper, beyond this surface acknowledgement and understanding of emotion, was something more. A bridge that could be crossed. A lingering connection left separated. Ellesandra could reach out to it if they sought deeper understanding...But it begged the question whether that would be a two way street. Regardless of all that happened unseen to the two elven lovers, Star managed a much more steady stride while being supported by Ellesandra. Now that it had been forced upon her, she seemed to take it wholly, and completely. A suggestion that she wanted to take it all along...But the fear that she felt was still there. The worry. The shame. And as clear as it was written on her face, Ellesandra wouldn't even need to look at her to understand these things in the moment, so long as their physical touch remained.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected to feel what Star felt. She almost pushed away, her instinctual reaction to break whatever connection there was between them, but she didn't. She frowned down at Star's legs when feeling just how tired and physically exhausted she was. Sighing, she stopped walking, bringing Star to a halt too. She had, indeed, created a solid emotional wall between them once she'd realized she could, mostly for fear of having her own emotions flow to Star like Star's was to her. Ellesandra didn't try to delve into anything they sense in Star, but feeling that physical exhaustion she moved to stand in front of Star instead, leaning down. "On my back." The words were an order - gruff, and still irritated. Start had pushed herself too far, obviously not knowing her limits. She'd pushed herself hard enough for it to be a danger to her, and thus to their survival in getting to this elven encampment. Ellesandra was leaning forward slightly, having removed her pack and set it on the ground next to them to make it easy for Star to lean into her back and wrap arms around Ellesandra's neck or shoulders. She didn't know if Star would do so without fighting, but Ellesandra was in no mood to argue the point. She was angry at Star for not saying something earlier, and there was guilt at not realizing just how bad off Star was. She'd trusted that Star had the remaining stamina, having not known Star enough to be able to tell the signs and how far she could push herself. That had obviously been a mistake.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Feeling the support leave her side, Star nearly stumbled and fell over. But she didn't. She managed to keep her balance, then looked curiously at Ellesandra. The two elves felt it better they not say anything. It seemed this was business between the knight and the mystic. So they stayed quiet as Star lightly flushed in the cheeks. But she didn't fight. She did as asked, moving to Ellesandra's back to lean over them so she could slide her arms around their neck. Her hold was tender and thankful. Her skin was soft around Ellesandra's neck. She rested her head against the back of theirs, and eased her legs into their hold when the time came for her to be carried. Then, the emotions returned. Shame. Guilt. Gratitude. Admiration, even. Conflicting feelings that made for a difficult to unravel ball of emotion that was tightly coiled in Star's heart. But the relief was there. She was able to rest, and with that, the serenity that surrounded her grew stronger. Ellesandra still would easily be able to refute any actual influence her powers had on the other; they might recall Star had said previously that her powers of actual influence only really worked with those who didn't know her, and with how easily Ellesandra could recognize her powers for what they were, it certainly made sense how only someone unaware of who she was could actually be influenced by her against their will. But for what it was worth, Star's influence hardly was like a psychic. It didn't implant thoughts or override feelings. But it would be hard to feel violent against someone whose presence was so...Reassuring. Soothing. Calm. "I'm sorry.." came a quiet whisper into Ellesandra's ear, just for them to hear. "I didn't want you to think me a monster."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra closed her eyes, letting the feel of Star's weight lean in on her back. She hesitated for a moment, feeling all the emotions flow through again, but gritted her teeth and ensured her own barrier was up against the calming influence. Being calmer might theoretically be helpful right now, but she did not want Star's power influencing her or touching her emotions any more than they had to. She took her sack and glanced over to Morrun, tossing the sack at his feet without a word. The order was obvious; while she carried Star, he was to carry her pack. Only after that did she hoop her hands beneath Star's thighs, lean forward a bit more then pushed into a fully standing position. The cuts on her thighs screamed in irritation at the added weight, but Ellesandra kept her jaw clenched and ignored the pain. They were small enough that she knew this wouldn't do any real damage other than irritate them and cause more pain as she walked, which she could deal with. Her head turned to look at Star's sharply when Star admitted her worries. There was surprise, followed by confusion. Who in the world told Star that she was a monster? Just because Ellesandra didn't want someone peering into her emotions or influencing them did not mean she was a monster. Her power was unfortunate, and was one that Ellesandra would prefer not to interact with, but it wasn't monstrous - at least not in what she'd seen so far. "Don't be ridiculous." The words were scolding. She wanted Star to know that her being a monster was a ridiculous concept to Ellesandra. She didn't say more though, not with the two elves following along while Ellesandra began the walk again. The added weight would tire her out quicker, but the good thing was Ellesandra was used to hauling heavy sacks and equipment for long hikes. It wouldn't be a good or fun time, but she would be able to do it - especially because she wasn't experiencing any particular lethargy from haste spells or anything right now.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A few emotions came in response to Ellesandra's words. More shame. Uncertainty. Confusion. A twisted gut that cried out apology for simply existing as she was. She might be able to see Ellesandra's emotions, feel them the way an empath could, but...That didn't give clarity to the reasons for them all. The emotions of someone who was lying were obvious to her. The emotions of someone with ulterior motives almost always gave them away, even those who were stoic and adept at concealing it all. But Ellesandra's emotions were...Complicated, and forced under a pile of rubble shaped as guilt. It made it tricky to know the first thing about them. It made it difficult to know when anger was inwardly focused, or when it was at Star herself. She said nothing further on the matter, electing only to rest and try to sort through her own feelings. She didn't pry into Ellesandra's. But her presence was there, open for Ellesandra to tap into any time, even if it was the most likely scenario that the walls remained up as much as possible between the two for the remainder of the trip. Morrun did manage the pack well, only occasionally needing to stop and rest his shoulder, which would give Ellesandra some time to set Star down and limber up before the march continued. And if the knight saw no further need to speak, there would be little beyond small talk between the husband and wife to fill the air as they walked through the natural path to their ultimate destination. Eventually, Morrun ran ahead a little. A hand rose up, then weaved a glyph in the air in green arcane energy, which opened up a hole in what was otherwise a rock face, revealing a path that cut into more of the forest. It grew more verdant as they walked deeper in. More green, more alive. A subtle mana clung to the air, reinforcing the natural growth in the area. It was pleasant and refreshing, but not very strong. Still, a welcome feeling after walking for so long; the sun had set on them, and it was well into night when they arrived. Morrun kept to the front, knowing they were in safe territory, and waved to unseen archers in trees to signal them that all was well. Nothing could be seen in those trees. A lethal place for any unwelcome visitors. But their safe passage led them to a sturdy wooden gate that had vines crawling up along the adjoining wall. Their approach was met with a raising of the gate, which allowed them into the settlement proper. Given the late hour and fatigue on everyone's bodies, Morrun turned to Ellesandra and Star with his offer: "I invite you both to my home. It isn't much, but I do have a spare bed." Spare bed, singular. "...Though I won't be offended if you'd prefer an inn. I'd happily pay for your rooms, if so, and can take you to it. We don't get many visitors as you can imagine, so its amenities are sparse, but...I don't know about you, but a rock would be a wonderfully soft pillow for me at this point. Whatever the case, I will have business to discuss in the morning with you both. A matter of my thanks, and honouring the original agreement, of course."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra tried her best not to feel or notice Star's emotions. Even as they came across the apparent link, she was doing her best to not only block out her own emotions from being noticed or felt by Star, but the other way around. Just like she felt as if it was invasive for Star to just be able to SEE the things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone, Ellesandra wasn't about to intentionally or actively do the same thing in the other direction. She'd give Star whatever privacy she could to process the emotions she had. When they stopped for a rest with Morrun placing the pack down, Ellesandra sat Star on a nearby rock for easy perching and moved to replace the bandage on her thighs. The walking with the extra weight wasn't helping it heal closed entirely, so she wanted to ensure it got properly taken care of. She also took some time to drink water and hand the waterskin over to Star, if she didn't have her own to drink - and then they were walking again. Ellesandra was quiet, which was normal for her, as they passed through the apparent illusion protecting the elven encampment. She also didn't say anything when Morrun ran up to greet someone, and as they approached even closer her eyes scanned here and there, watching out for an ambush. As much as she could watch out, anyways - elves were notorious for being able to hide in trees well. She was certain she'd missed some scouts at some point, even with her watchfulness. There was a wary caution about her; trusting Morrun not to intentionally lead them into danger, but also recognizing that there might still be danger either way. When they got to the place that was apparently Morrun's home, she glanced back at Star. "Point me to the bed and I'll put Miss Lumina in it. She needs her rest, I'm afraid her mission to rescue your wife took more out of her than she admitted." There was a gentle scolding to her voice again, but it was only partial. There was no need to beat a dead horse, after all. "If it's okay with her, I'll find the Inn and get some food and sleep there. I don't think she's in any particular danger from the two of you, or other elves here, is she?" Ellesandra's eyebrows narrowed as she asked the question, intentionally making it sound like a threat that if she was in danger, they would have to deal with her.



</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was some measure of guilt on the faces of the two elves upon hearing that Star had pushed herself so hard, but it was also plain and obvious that was the case. The two could do nothing but be grateful for what was done for them. "She'll have everything she needs to recuperate, I promise you," said Morrun, earning a smile and a nod of agreement from Lissana. A bed and a few home cooked meals was the least they could provide, though there was some mild and short-lived surprise when Ellesandra opted to take to the inn. Was there perhaps an...Assumption being made about Star and Ellesandra? They didn't comment. "Neither of you will be in any danger. Even if this settlement is for we elves, we shelter others plenty. Nobody will give it a second thought. If someone got in the gates, they are welcome," he said, then gestured down the residential street. The pathways within the settlement were made of wood which gave solid foundation to support over the otherwise soft earth. Through the main street the group came to a central square that branched off in several directions, including two wooden staircases that moved up and into the trees. Looking up, several buildings and presumably residences were built around the trunks of sturdy, tall trees; many of the trees in this grove extended up into the sky like spires. Mighty redwoods left to grow for ages, the most massive of which stood at what was presumably the heart of the city, wide enough in its circumference that it might take a solid half hour to walk a full revolution around the wooden pathways that were build around it. But for the time being, the group was more focused on their grounded section of the grove. Other elves moved around, not paying much attention to Star or Ellesandra, despite those two being the shortest people around, with everyone else reaching near or above six feet tall. It being so late at night did mean the activity was minimal, with only a few other denizens of the grove showing their faces, many of them just night patrol guards donning leather armor and sheathed blades with longbows over their shoulders. It was peaceful, and it seemed there was enough of a martial presence to keep the grove safe. Eventually, the two came to a humble wooden home. Not very large, but stepping inside did bring with it a cozy feeling. A simple, warm place to live. Morrun led Ellesandra through the main living space to a side room that had a guest bed ready and waiting for Star. It was certainly big enough for two with room to spare, supporting why the elves had been taken slightly off guard by the knight's insistence to take to the inn when there was space right there to sleep for them. But no questions were asked; once Star was set to bed, where she more or less fell asleep instantly, Morrun was waiting to meet Ellesandra by the door to the room after kissing his wife goodnight. "Be along shortly, love," he whispered to his wife, then smiled at Ellesandra. First, he handed the woman their pack with a bit of a grunt as he worked it off his shoulder; he'd needed to wear it on one shoulder while his own pack was on his back, and had swapped many times during the trip. "Dunno how you can bear to carry that thing," he said with a soft laugh. "Let me walk you to the inn, make sure you have your bearings so you can find your way back here in the morning."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed Morrun, eyes scanning the trees and the surrounding elves. At first, she had her guard up high, not entirely sure this wasn't some form of trap, but as they got deeper into the settlement and she saw plenty of signs of civilian elves, not just militia or military or anything like that, she began to relax some. She ignored the look between Morrun and his wife and instead eyed the area around the house before going in for the tour. When finding the guest room, she walked around the bed to take a good look at it before turning and lowering down to lightly place the sleepy Star onto the bed directly, encouraging her to relax her hold and fall back onto the bed. Ellesandra's thighs screamed at this, both from the exertion of carrying Star this whole way as well as their wounds. She gritted her teeth, fighting through the pain of that and her muscles reminding her she didn't do the same military drills she had previously to keep in shape. She wasn't entirely surprised Star fell asleep quickly, but Ellesandra did take a moment to ensure she got tucked in and had a pillow and was comfortable. She'd also been sure to remove Star's own pack or anything extra, though she didn't touch Star's clothing. The pack was set to the side, before she turned and followed Morrun out. She took the pack back, throwing it over her shoulders again, and nodding to him. "Years of practice, you get used to it when you carry your life on your back." She didn't remember the last time she'd settled down in any one place for more than maybe a week at a time, unless on a job. And even then, it wasn't often. Her gaze went around the place again while following Morrun to the Inn, waiting for the other shoe to drop and see why he wanted to guide her or if he had something else he needed to say.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The walk to the inn was unremarkable. Morrun looked too tired to hold any sort of conversation. But he did genuinely want the knight to have their bearings in this place. A ways down the road from his home, then a right, then a left after some more walking, and they were closer to the central, massive tree. A few more civilians were about, but most were inside. The inn had clear signage: 'The Sleepy Seldarine'. Knowledge of elvish lore would reveal this to be a nod to an old elven pantheon, but it was little more than a name. Before stepping in, Morrun had but a single piece of business. A coin purse that he held out to Ellesandra. If taken and inspected, Ellesandra would find fifty platinum pieces inside. Each worth ten gold, which meant this was five hundred gold pieces worth of coin. "Please...Take this. For the inn, for food, for provisions, supplies..." Five hundred gold bought all that and a bit more within the first fifty gold, so five hundred was clearly for more than that. "...And as thanks for all you did. I was trying to raise the money myself to pay off the pirates, but as you can tell it was slow going. Too slow. I won't be destitute without this, before you go thinking I'm giving you the shirt off my back. But you deserve that, too. I had taken it on myself to help Star as a favour, a mutually beneficial thing. But in the time it took her to arrive, the pirates rolled in and took over and, well...You know the rest. You both will always be welcome here, but...Since you carry your life on your back, I suspect you'll be on your way before long. You've saved me from having a great tragedy in my life. If parting with a little coin can help spare you the same, then I won't take no for an answer. And something tells me Star isn't the sort to accept the deserved generosity of others." He smiled. "A pure heart like hers is lucky to have a cautious, sensible eye like yours watching over her. The world needs guardians like you. So, please. Lissana and I will be fine, thanks to you both."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along, only glancing at the sign. She didn't know too much about elves, so the name didn't ring a bell to her. When Morrun turned to hand over a bag of coin, she looked down at it, then up to him. One eyebrow raised, having not expected to be paid for this job at all. When he explained that it had been saved up to save his wife and wouldn't be impacting his livelihood itself, she reached forward and took it without a complaint. A quick glance inside to see the platinum made her tilt her head and look back up at him in surprise. This was way more than she would have charged even if she had hired herself out for the job. "I hardly think I should be considered a world guardian." She considered the cut to her thighs and how she'd let just three lowly pirates injure her. She'd underestimated the first mate it had seemed, and his willingness to harm his own crew in order to get her. "I'll be sure to share this with Miss Lumina before we part ways." Or should she consider this her payment to help Star along in her journey? It would still be more than she'd expect from that, not unless Star was hiring her for a long journey. Still, it was an option. "Was there anything else you needed? Otherwise I would like to change my dressings and then settle in for the night, and I'm sure your wife would like your comfort this evening after everything she has been through."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun looked briefly perplexed by the notion of Ellesandra and Star parting ways. But, assumptions were cast aside and he nodded at the following words. "Of course. I don't mean to keep you. Good night, ma'am. Please come by in the morning so we can see you off." With a smile, he left Ellesandra to check into the inn. A simple process, name asked and recorded in the log book, payment of a single gold piece for a night's stay received, and key and directions given to the room. It was a comfortable room. A nice bed, simple amenities, including a magical shower that sprayed water from a blue crystal affixed to the ceiling of the small restroom that Ellesandra could use to wash away they day's woes if they so desired, either before or after sleeping. The room was theirs for the night, and a well-earned rest awaited them. Whenever they did come to find sleep, however...Their dream would find them in a waking, lucid state within it. Clearly understanding they were dreaming, the world around them took the space of a blank, black void initially. After a minute or so, focus came to the realm. A wilderness path. Not the one they had taken to the grove. Not one Ellesandra had seen before. The knight was in their full armor with their weapon at their hip, despite presumably falling asleep without it. The wounds on their legs didn't exist in this dream state. There was nobody around initially...But after looking around for a while in this dream, Ellesandra would spot someone. Or, what was presumably a person. It had a vaguely human shape, but was but a cloud of darkness. Black, smokey lines wafted up and off the figure. They were five-foot-seven, or thereabout. Not immediately identifiable as masculine or feminine in build. A vague black avatar of a person. Featureless. Unarmed. And despite the lack of eyes or anything resembling the same, Ellesandra would be able to know this figure was...Looking at them. Silent, for now, but...Watching expectantly.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra got her room and went to relax. She took good use of the shower, enjoying the water pouring on her head and letting it both wash away the sweat from the walk and the fight but also spending some time working on dealing with the emotions that had arisen that day. She tried to push them all back down into the box where they should have stayed the whole time, not coming out to hit her again at the sight and thought of Star. When she finally did change her dressings and get into bed, she was wearing just underclothes and had her armor and sword to the side, so it was strange waking up in her dream to...being fully armored. And in the wilderness. She looked around, obviously confused. Was this a dream, or something else? It seemed a bit more real than most of her dreams, but she couldn't really tell well. Typically when she dreamed, it was bad dreams; nightmares and memories she'd repressed and that only came up during her subconscious dreams. Now, she found herself staring at a shadowy black figure that she could tell was looking at her, but couldn't make anything else out about them. Her hand moved to rest on the hilt of her sword, prepared to withdraw it if needed, and she took up a more defensive posture in front of this creature. She didn't speak either, just watching it and waiting to see what it did, or if it made any hostile actions. It might not mean harm, but Ellesandra tended to be cautious and assume the worst.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The vague shadow figure didn't show signs of hostility. It simply spoke to Ellesandra, in a voice that didn't quite sound natural. The voice was as androgynous as the shape of the figure. "...She will die," said the voice. "History will repeat itself, as it does on, and on, and on again. Not tomorrow...But soon. To walk beside her in staunch defiance of fate...Or to turn and allow yourself the comfort of not knowing how, or when...I wonder which you will choose." As the voice spoke, a figure appeared before it. It was, quite obviously, Star. Bruised, beaten, bloody...But as they looked up at Ellesandra, their face changed. Shifted. It wasn't Star anymore, but the princess from Ellesandra's past. Tear-filled eyes, fear filling them as death loomed over them. Then, back to Star. Then the princess. Then Star. Shifting, melding together, interchanging with one another with swift flickers; it was a reflection of Ellesandra's subconscious association of the two women. The smoky figure remained still. But Ellesandra would find their legs chained at the ankles, with the chains taut and affixed to a mountain that was miles behind the knight. The knight could walk no closer to the smoky figure and the desperate woman that was on their knees before them. Ten feet separated them, but it was...A distance that could not be closed. Just barely out of reach. "To face the inevitable...Or to walk away..."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was confused at first, when the shadow figure said she will die. Who would die? And then the figure appeared to be Star and Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She clenched her teeth, the rapier coming out of it's sheath as if to strike down the illusionary Star. She began to move to do so when the image changed. The rapier fell to the ground, clattering against the dirt as Star's form changed into that of Marigold's. Bright red hair was combed perfectly down her back, a single braid in a decorative circlet around the front of her head like she always used to wear. The freckles on her cheek standing out against pale skin and bright blue eyes looking down at Ellesandra. A wide smile that lit up her face, eyes that held hope and naivety and pure optimism for the world. Though at this moment, it wasn't that expression. Is the one Ellesandra remembered well. The look of surprise, tears in her eyes as she looked up at her captors, the pain and acceptance on her face as the blade was falling. "Mari!" The name, or nickname, escaped her lips without thought, as if saying it now would prevent the past from happening. Fuck, this was a nightmare, wasn't it? The image changed back to Star. From pure looks alone, they weren't very similar. But their dress, how they held themselves, their pure heart and happiness to help anyone and everyone they could, their stubbornness when they had made up their mind on something; it all struck deep. They may have different physical looks, but they were very close to the same beyond that. With the change back to Star, Ellesandra was broken out of the shock and grief that filled her again. "A dream." She said to herself, trying to stumble back away from the figure and tripping over the chains that had appeared. The normally graceful and poised bodyguard fell on her ass, looking down to see herself chained at the ankles in shock, then back up to the shadow creature that kept switching its appearance. "Get away." There was fear, there. Fear, anguish, guilt. She didn't want to be faced with the same guilt she'd been shoving down for years, and seeing Marigold's face had forced that back up so strongly that Ellesandra didn't have the presence of mind to try to mask her emotions or repress them. "Stop it."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
With Ellesandra falling on their backside, the figure changed back to Marigold. "Please don't leave me," said Marigold, her voice exactly as Ellesandra remembered it. But as soon as those words left Marigold's lips, it was Star again. But the pleading look never left her eyes. "I need you," said Star. But then was back to Marigold. One in the same, the two figures were shifting back and forth at random. The shadowy figure then extended one arm outward. In their hand formed a shadowy, deadly scythe. The tool of the reaper. The intent was obvious. "Run away," said the shadowy figure. "Embrace your cowardice," it continued. "Don't leave me!" screamed Marigold through choked sobs. Or was it...Star? Whichever woman it was, they were sobbing, crying out for Ellesandra. "Pathetic fool." The shadow figure's last words came as it swung its scythe down towards Star. But just before the scythe could strike and kill Star before Ellesandra's eyes, adrenaline spiked in their living, conscious body, and thrust them awake. It had been minutes in the dream...But the sun was rising in the waking world. It was morning.

Ellesandra
Ellesandra stayed on her ass, watching with wide eyes and mouth partially open, up until the scythe was heading towards Star. She threw herself forward, as if trying to block it, but she knew it was too late. She'd been on her ass, just watching, for too long - even if she were able to reach Star or the scythe while chained up. She wouldn't make it in time. Just as she was about to see the scythe split Star, her eyes opened and she shot up in bed into a sitting position. Her breathing was heavy and sweat covered her body. It truly had been a nightmare, one that she was sure she'd tossed and turned in. Had she screamed? She might have screamed there at the end, when Star was about to be killed before her eyes. She put her face in her hands and tried to practice deep breaths to calm her racing heart down. The sight of Marigold wasn't one that she was entirely unused to in her dreams; it wasn't the first time she'd had a nightmare of the day Marigold had died, but she usually hardly remembered the dream - just woke up from the nightmare and couldn't sleep longer. The addition of star, and comparison between the two, bothered Ellesandra. She moved out of bed and took another shower that morning; it was necessary with how much she'd sweat through the night, and to help calm her racing body and emotions. If she was going to go visit Star, she needed to get her emotions in check. There was no need for Star to see the panic and increased guilt at the idea of her leaving Star and Star dying because of it. She slammed the side of her fist into the wall and cursed to her breath. As she got out, she quickly dressed, but she left her armor off. There was no way Star was leaving today, and if Star planned to leave she was going to shove the woman back down into bed to rest, so if Ellesandra were to stay in the realms of the settlement there was no need for armor. As such, she found her way to Morrun's early in the morning wearing basic brown breaches and what would be a typical man's white jerkin, hanging loosely around the small curves she did have. Her rapier did still rest on her right hip, the only bit of her normal attire that she was wearing currently. She knocked softly at the door, wondering if this were too early to check on Star. She needed to, after that dream.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The knock was met with some shuffling and footsteps. The door opened, Lissana waiting to greet the knight with a smile. She opened the door and invited them in. "Please, come in! I was just making breakfast, I'll make some more for you. I hope you like hot cakes," she said, the elven woman clearly in higher spirits after a night's rest. Invited in, the kitchen was at the back of the home, with a dining room a bit before that. A simple table and seating for four. Morrun was nowhere to be seen, presumably up the flight of stairs to the right, possibly still in bed. The door on the left wall that led to the guest room was closed. "If you'd like to check in on Star, I'm sure she'll need a good meal as much as the rest of us. She might still be asleep."
 
</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She waited patiently, and when the door opened to Lissana, Ellesandra lowered her head in a polite greeting. "No need to go out of your way, Miss. I simply wanted to confirm Star was doing well, and then I'll be on my way. I believe the Inn has it's own breakfast too." There was a pause and she glanced past Lissana towards where the kitchen was. "Are you sure you should be up and about cooking already? If you need more rest or time with your husband to help recover, I would be happy to cook something for all of you." As much as Ellesandra wanted to rush to Star's room and check on her, she also needed to remember that Lissana had gone through hell the past few days as well. She may not have been on the verge of passing out, like Star was, but there were emotional and mental strains that Ellesandra probably couldn't see. Could Star? Did seeing that type of thing wear Star out more? She pushed the thought to the side. Maybe she'd ask at one point, but not right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana shook her head. "On the contrary! A little normalcy is really helpful. Being at home, cooking for my husband and our esteemed guests is just what I need to...Feel normal again, you know?" she said, offering a smile to Ellesandra. "I...You can bet I'll not be leaving the safety of this grove for a while. But so long as I'm here, I'll be okay. So please, don't assume I'm that bad a cook," she said with a teasing smile. "I've some fresh fruit I fetched at dawn to go with it all. Please, I insist. You and Star are the ones who need rest. If anyone would take my place cooking, I'd say it ought to be Morrun, if my darling wasn't the sort to set fire to the kitchen for trying." Another smile. A kind woman, once she opened up. Long term trauma was more likely; a hesitance to ever leave what is known and comfortable. But the woman could face that in time. For now, it seemed assuming some normalcy was the therapy she needed. She could, however, just be adept at pushing it all down, like Ellesandra did. Only Star would be able to tell, but she was still presumably sleeping in the guest bed.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
That made sense. Ellesandra nodded, relenting. "Okay, as you wish. I appreciate your hospitality. Don't let Morrun work you too hard though, he does deserve to do his fair share around here too." Ellesandra was joking, of course. She had no idea what Morrun did around the house and wouldn't actually judge him at all for it, either way. "I'll leave you to it while I check on Miss Lumina, but if you need any assistance don't hesitate to call out." She wanted the woman to feel comfortable around her, at least while she was here. It was entirely possible that she associate Ellesandra with death, since the first time she'd seen Ellesandra she'd been cleaning the blood of pirates off her sword. Or associate her with the whole horrible situation that happened. Walking through to the guest room door, Ellesandra gave it a very light knock. She didn't want to wake Star if Star were sleeping, but she also didn't want to just walk in without knocking in case Star was needing privacy for any reason. If there was no answer to the knock, she would lightly crack the door and peek inside, just to ensure Star was sleeping soundly and didn't look like she'd had a rough night or anything.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana gave a giggle in response. "Worry not, he's around for all the things that need a little muscle or his big brain to figure out," she said back, then moved to the kitchen to resume her cooking. A simple breakfast, really, cooked over the fire of the home's oven. There was no immediate answer to the knock. Cracking the door would reveal Star was just waking, arms stretching up over her head with a big yawn. She then opened one eye as she rubbed the sleep out of the other. She smiled a bright, beautifully happy smile to see Ellesandra peeking through the door. Even if they were mostly obscured behind it, Star clearly recognized them by as little detail as just an eye through the crack. "Good morning, Ellesandra," said Star, sleepy but slowly waking. Seemed she didn't have a rough night. But as long as she could see Ellesandra, there was that...Stare again. Her way of checking on the knight.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let out a soft breath when she saw Star waking, and doing so in a way that seemed like she was okay. In fact, she had a bright smile on her face. The sigh of relief was minimal compared to the flood of relieved feelings washing through Ellesandra. She was fine, it was just a dream. She didn't know why she had dreamt it; likely, she had a subconscious fear of Star meeting the same fate as Marigold if Ellesandra didn't accompany her to protect her. Which meant, what choice did she have? There was a grief and anxiety that accompanied the relief, thinking about the dream and Marigold, but Ellesandra wrangled that into submission like she did with all of her emotions. A bottled up, ready to overflow emotional bomb, just waiting to finally release and explode, but for now it was bottled up. Not that this prevented Star from seeing it, however. Slipping inside and closing the door behind her, Ellesandra crossed her arms and looked Star up and down, checking for any signs of continued fatigue. "Stop that." Her eyes met Star's, at that stare that she was giving her. "I get that you can't control that you can see or maybe even feel what's going on in me, but stop actively trying to understand." A boundary she was at least trying to set. Though despite how abrupt her words were, Ellesandra wasn't angry. Nor was she ashamed of Star or what she could do. No, there was more...fear. Not afraid of Star herself, but afraid of someone seeing into her. Of asking questions. Of pushing her to process things she still wasn't ready to do. "How are you, fatigue wise? Do you need help getting out to the table for breakfast?" And a quick topic change, trying to encourage Star not to go down that route of conversation or ask why Ellesandra was so protective over how she felt.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star could see the emotions. The relief. The concern. It told her something was on Ellesandra's mind. Some guesses popped into her head, but she never assumed such things if she could help it. She was about to ask, but then the knight interrupted her before she began. She blinked, then blushed a little, and maybe even pouted a tiny bit. Understanding people was sort of her...Thing. Core to her being. So to have a wall slam down over it was clearly frustrating. Confusing, even. She heard the questions, the shift in topic. But Star was a bit too stubborn to just let them lead her along like that and pretend they hadn't said anything. "...Yesterday morning I told you what I saw. And you told me that there is no mountain," she said, her voice kind and gentle. Sympathy overtook her features, replacing the pout. "So...As far as I can see, until you point it out to me otherwise...There is no mountain," she said, speaking in words that only really made sense to the two of them. "That won't stop me from seeing the way the winds blow around the shape of what certainly isn't there. There's only so much I can willfully blind myself. And even that...I have no shame admitting that it doesn't sit well with me. But I do now, and always will, respect your privacy on the matter. I won't ask...But if what led us into the whole situation yesterday is any indication, I can't see suffering go unanswered. So at the very least...As long as we're together, I'll be watching. Even if there's nothing I can do...Sometimes it's just nice to know someone cares." She smiled, then swiftly sprung up from the bed, using Ellesandra's own quick diversionary tactics against them as she shot up to her feet. "As for my fatigue? All gone!" she said, beaming bright. "The only reason I was so drained was because I'd sapped almost all my mana for what I was doing. Casting the spells on their own was strenuous enough, but, ahehe...Casting spells in quick succession makes them exceptionally more taxing, and I only had seconds to do what I was doing to ensure we got out safely, so...Point is, I'm recovering! Not back to full strength I admit, but, I'm not sore any longer."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's jaw clenched. Anger spiked at Star's words, though it wasn't really anger at Star. It was the grief of what that mountain was masking itself as anger because that was easier for Ellesandra to process. If she pretended the mountain didn't exist, she didn't have to deal with it. The comment about a mountain reminded her that she'd been chained to one in her dream, and the idea made her blink her eyes and turn her head to the side. Had her eyes teared up, just for a moment, before she blinked it away? No way to tell now, as Ellesandra was quick to turn after Star hopped out of bed to display how well she was doing now. "Good. You need your food then. Come out when you're ready." She could respond to Star's comment about someone caring, about being able to tell there was a lot Ellesandra was not saying to or showing her, but she didn't. Instead she slipped out of the room, leaving the door closed behind to give Star any privacy she needed. Ellesandra didn't go immediately, though. She took a moment in the hallway to ensure she was fully in control again, that her eyes weren't about to tear up once more, before walking down the hallway back towards the kitchen.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star didn't need to see a tear to see the emotions that caused it. Her expression remained sympathetic in the face of the tears, in the face of the anger, all of it. It wasn't like this was the first time someone had responded, well, emotionally to her stance on the matter. She almost expected it at this point. Star did take some time to get ready, namely by making use of the shower the elven couple had attached to the guest room. When she arrived to join for breakfast, her hair was damp and weighted down, but clean and pretty as could be. Her dress seemed to have had the blood removed from it from when Star woke just a handful of minutes earlier and now. Magic, perhaps? Regardless, Star took a seat just as Lissana was coming out with plates. Hot cakes, as promised, with two kinds of berry jam, a refined elven syrup that was sweet and earthy, and a large bowl of fresh fruits and berries to enjoy on their own, or perhaps to garnish the hotcakes with in the case of the berries alongside the jam. Adding to this, some meat sausage was divvied up on each plate to add some protein to the meal. The food was simple, but wholesome, and the elven cuisine had a hallmark elven complexity to the simple dish. Cold milk and orange juice was offered to drink alongside. Overall, an enjoyable meal that would give a good deal of energy for the day head. Lissana called up for Morrun once she laid out the plates, then joined the other two. Morrun shambled down the stairs, having clearly not slept the greatest, and joined the others with a smile after kissing his wife good morning. "So, Star, Ellesandra," began Morrun as he grabbed one set of cutlery to poke at a hotcake and take from the communal pile of them that was placed in the center. There were enough hotcakes for each person to have three of the medium-sized treats, but Lissana didn't look like a big eater. That, plus the huge helping of fruit meant there would certainly be leftovers unless Ellesandra had a bottomless gut. Morrun put some syrup on his hotcake. "What is the plan from here? I owe you the information promised, which will undoubtedly shape the next leg of your journey. I don't mean to rush, but I also don't wish to hold you up, so...If you intend on staying a while, as much can wait until after breakfast I'm sure. But I still am curious, if it's not prying to ask. Just, well...It would be nice to know that bright horizons await heroes like you both."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra would have offered to help set the table, but by the time Star came out she had been sitting in her own spot, having put her hair back up in a ponytail like it had been the latter half of the day yesterday, and staring down at her hands clasped on the table in front of her. Her fingertips were callused, hands rough; the hands of someone who had worked their life. Not just the hands of a warrior, but someone who had done manual labor as well, wielding tools as well as weapons. Her hands tightened as she struggled with her emotions, the bottle seemingly having sprung a leak. When Star sat down, she looked up and met Star's gaze for but a moment, but she couldn't look at Star long. Not while the memory of Star and Marigold's faces replacing one another was so present in her mind, from the dream. She looked away, happy for the distraction when Lissana came in with the breakfast and began placing them down in front of them. Ellesandra had leaned back, being respectful and waiting until Morrun arrived and began eating before she touched her own food. She was ravenous, and wasn't ashamed when her stomach had growled at the prospect of finally eating after the long day they'd had yesterday. She started with the sausage, quiet as Morrun began speaking. She glanced at Star for a moment, then back to Morrun. "For my part, it depends on Miss Lumina here. I'll be accompanying her until her mission is complete, so it's how she would like to proceed." It was a decision she'd come to, an easy one, after that dream. Even if it had been her subconscious bringing that image up, that she'd be running away from Star and dooming her to the same fate Marigold had, which made the decision easier, she knew she wouldn't have been able to just walk away. Not when Star so clearly indicated she needed the help. She didn't meet Star's gaze after saying this, eyes returning to her plate and using the food as a distraction to prevent meeting eyes or being questioned about that decision.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The surprise on Star's face was obvious. She looked at Ellesandra. If they had been alone, Star would have quite a few questions about when all this changed. But now she was facing down two elves where were...Also having trouble understanding. Morrun in particular had been told just last night that they were parting ways. Or did the knight mean in the eventual conclusion of this? It was vague, and very much not something he was about to bring up and possibly cause confusion or hurt feelings on the matter. So eyes went to Star. And at that point, Star just decided to not look a gift horse in the mouth. She had been struggling since she decided to venture on without Nina - a non-violent woman in a violent world, after all - so having Ellesandra was as comforting pragmatically as it was emotionally. It had only been a day, but...Ellesandra was an easy person to admire with the way they faced danger. Star also couldn't help but notice that her knightly companion couldn't look at her. But she didn't draw attention to it. As she said...There was no mountain. "Oh, uhm, well," Star began a little nervously. "I was hoping the information you had would lead me to a way to get to my home plane. I was told you had information about that, so I guess our plans depend on the details of what you have to share, Morrun," she said, specifically using 'our' in her words. Since Ellesandra was in it for the long haul, apparently. Happily joined, if confused about it, Star remained. Morrun nodded, pausing to finish a mouthful of hotcake before answering. "Right. Well. Let's finish breakfast then, and I can tell you all about those details. I don't wish to get your hopes up massively, but I will do all I can to help you along, all the same." Smiles were exchanged, and little more than small talk joined in on breakfast through to its conclusion unless Ellesandra had more to offer. The lion's share of the food was the knight's to have; Morrun and Lissana both turned out to be light eaters. Star enjoyed her share, a bit more than she might normally as she was recovering her strength, but seemed to prefer the fruit. Not that she didn't enjoy the hotcakes and sausage, but even with the hotcake, she smothered it in berries and seemed to delight in specifically the taste of the blueberries, with her face lighting up with delight in each bite. A favourite food, clearly, as unless others were grabbing them, she specifically sought the blueberries out to take for herself, looking a little sheepish and asking if anyone else wanted more before helping herself to the last of them. This left plenty for the knight to enjoy, and the group remained until it was clear all had their fill. Lissana then set about cleaning up, and Morrun and Star moved over to the living space so they could discuss what Star came here to learn in the first place. Star shot a glance at Ellesandra, inviting them to join along and hear what Morrun had to say.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had, at first, just taken one hotcake and otherwise added a lot of the fruit and sausage to her plate. She had eaten the hotcake without any of the jam, though as the meal went on and she saw how Star was reaching for the blueberries, she separated them on her plate and stopped eating them. As the conversation went on and Morrun confirmed they would discuss later, Ellesandra mostly tuned out the small talk. Oh, she was listening, but only for key words, her name, or if anyone addressed her specifically. Instead her eyes were down on her plate, eating in silence and trying her best to keep that 'mountain' bottled back down. The dream last night had really fucked with her sense of emotional stability, and that on top of how they had already been stirred up by Star herself. In all reality, it was probably Star's presence that had caused the dream. When she'd finished with what she was going to eat, and after Star had asked if anyone wanted the last of the blueberries, Ellesandra deftly lifted her own plate and moved to sit it in front of Star. It had what was remaining of the blueberries Ellesandra had gotten, properly saved to the side once she'd realized how happily Star had eaten them. She didn't say anything with the sharing of the food, but instead drank some of the milk that was provided and turning to Morrun, speaking up for the first time since the small talk had started, and simply asking him a couple of questions about the elven settlement - what it was like, the people, and how it defended itself against people like the pirates. Small talk that would distract from the small gesture of kindness, one that Ellesandra did not want to be commented upon. As they were finished and were moving to the living space to discuss the next steps, Ellesandra stood. She helped Lissana collect the plates and all the cutlery at least, but soon left Lissana to doing her normal duties and getting back into the swing of her normal life while moving to stand near the entrance of the living area. A habit of hers gotten from years of being a bodyguard; standing near the entrances and scanning the room, but not sitting to relax as part of the conversation.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was a woman of emotion. That much was obvious. But even firmly knowing that, it might come to surprise Ellesandra that the simple act of thoughtfulness and kindness was enough to bring Star to tears. Actual tears. When she saw what the knight had done, the tears ran down her cheek. She took a moment to herself, dabbing a napkin against her eyes as she collected herself again. Her bright smile and giggles and assurances that she was fine were enough to keep the elven couple from worrying too much, but it was still quite the reaction. She enjoyed those last blueberries on Ellesandra's plate most of all, savoured one at a time. It resolved without incident, and things moved back to business. Morrun sat on the couch, facing Star who sat on an opposing seat, and both of them gave odd looks to Ellesandra who stood by the door, but neither questioned it. Morrun began with a clearing of his throat: "Right. Well. A bit about me, I'm a scholar of the planes. The Material Plane refers to central planes that are surrounded by inner and outer planes, as far as the scholarly understanding goes. But there are quite a few planes that qualify as Material. I understand from the description that you're from another such place, Star," he said, earning a nod from Star. "Right. So, to reach another plane like that requires some strong magic, or a portal. From what I observed, you were capable of using Dimension Door, the telltale door-like creations of that spell are quite obvious. Would you perhaps be capable of making stable portals for yourself?" asked Morrun. Star gave a small nod, though with a rub at her neck. "Yes, though...That's a bit tricky, and can be taxing to do. I'm still learning how to do more advanced things like that," she said, giving a nervous laugh. "No matter, no matter. That you're at least that familiar is enough. Because, well, the main thing that has had my interest as of late is that, about a year ago, there was some commotion a ways north-east of here. Along the coast, but at least another two days on the road on foot. Maybe one if you can go by coach. There were some ruins there, and some very curious individuals showed up to examine them. A band of adventurers, looked like. But notably, they had ears like a fox atop their head. Pointy and fluffy. Not terribly uncommon, but they uniquely did not have tails to accompany those ears. Combining that with their clothing and magic I observed them using, and I have it on good confidence they were from Myst." He paused for effect here. Star just...Blinked. This meant nothing to her. Morrun cleared his throat again. "...Myst is a plane outside the regular cosmology of the array of Material Planes. It's its own pocket of the multiverse, said to have been created a long time ago by someone known only as the Wizard of Myst. This place is host to interdimensional travelers, not unlike the githzerai or githyanki, though far, far less war-like than the githyanki. Myst, by contrast, is a place said to house two things that I think will be of great import in your mission to find your home. First...It is known as the city of gates. It is said if one can get to Myst, they can get anywhere else in the multiverse. Anywhere. From Faerun to Eberron to Ravnica to Dragonlance...Anywhere." His insistence was made clear by repetition. "And if you don't even know where to look? Well. It also houses what it calls the Athenaeum. Said to be the single greatest collection of knowledge in all the multiverse, a library of infinite and impossible proportion, if there is any knowledge that exists on where your home is, Star...It will be there. So. Though it has been quite some time, it may be your best bet to begin looking where these people have been, these travelers from Myst, and by whatever means you see fit, be able to follow them to Myst and, from there, go where you need to go. Of course...If ever that leads you back here, you'll have a bed waiting." A smile. "I'm...Afraid I don't have anything tangible on that regard, however. Myst is said to have a magical cipher that protects it from unwanted travelers, and of course a race of ancient elves that guard it, which is in part, how I learned of it. There is an elder elf here in this grove, Master Ridoru, who spoke of reveries he has had about being part of this legendary band of elves, known as the Arethi, in a past life. Not that I think knowing more on that front will help you find Myst, but...I'm sure if you feel the need to talk to him, I could secure an audience."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had NOT expected that reaction. She'd snapped her head up when she saw tears and there was a mixture between panic, confusion, and guilt. These emotions weren't attached to the normal guilt that Star might sense in Ellesandra, but separate. Had Star not wanted the blueberries? Was there something wrong with giving them to her? Why were there tears? Still, the rest of the meal seemed to go on past that, but the confusion and guilt didn't entirely go away with Ellesandra making a mental note not to randomly share food with Star again. She wasn't good at emotions, certainly not her own and definitely not others, so it wasn't easy for her to tell if those had been good or bad tears. As Morrun began explaining the magic, Ellesandra felt her head hurting a little. She understood some magic, being a spellsword of her own, but others she didn't. And all this interplanar stuff was way beyond her knowledge or experience. She knew some basic things, like there was a plane where you went to when you died, that Kelemvor would guide your soul to it's appropriate afterlife - whatever that might be and whoever you might worship - but anything in depth she didn't. The idea of this Myst place, somewhere that was apparently a gateway to any other plane, was a good start though. If Star knew the specific plane they needed to go to, they'd perhaps find a way to travel there from Myst. Her gaze went to Star, letting the mage lead the conversation for their side not only because this was her mission, but also because she knew more about it. Ellesandra did offer a - "We do have some funds available for travel, should someone in Myst need it, Miss Lumina." This might be news to Star, so she felt like it needed to be shared. She hadn't yet shared the coin Morrun had given her the night before with Star intentionally, but she would once they were out of the city.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star considered the information at length. She was surprised to hear that there were funds available. She of course had a bit herself, but she hoped to get more while in Cloverport. That didn't pan out quite the way she hoped. She was still getting used to the idea that Ellesandra was even coming with her, so that, plus now having money? All variables to consider. "I see," she said, curiously looking at Ellesandra. Not to study their emotions, but just to convey her pensive nature. Her eyes flicked to the floor, just picking another spot to look at that wasn't the knight, to keep them from being uncomfortable. "Hm. Well, it certainly sounds promising, and since I won't be able to do anything with portals at least until I am back to full strength anyway, a day of travel suits me fine. If we have the funds for travel, that helps...But I don't suppose coaches often travel from this grove, Morrun?" she asked, which had him think for a moment. He blinked. "No, the closest place to secure a coach would be..." He went a bit white, then. "...C-Cloverport. R-Right.." A nervous chuckle followed. "Right, well...Uhhh...Surely there's something else," he said, racking his brain. Star giggled, waving a hand. "I'm more than used to life on the road. We can instead use the money for some extra rations for the road to supplement what I can get from the land." A comment from Star that had Lissana poking her head out of the kitchen: "I've already put together some extras we don't need that you're taking with you, and that's final!" she said in a sing-songy voice. So it seemed the money could be saved for when it was later needed, if all that was secure. Star looked at Ellesandra. "Well. Unless you feel like going back to Cloverport to risk running into our lawless friends again, I'd say we have some walking to do, and only so many hours of daylight to get to it. What say you?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head sternly when Star indicated they might go back to Cloverport to hitch a ride. No, that was a horrible idea, and not one that Ellesandra would allow Star to follow without a very good reason. However, when it came to starting off walking, she crossed her arms and looked Star up and down again, assessing her physical condition. "Are you absolutely sure you are in a fit state to start off today, Miss Lumina? You were barely able to walk straight yesterday evening and you crashed as soon as I laid you down on the bed. It may be best to rest for another day at least before we head out." Ellesandra wasn't entirely sure what urgency Star was under. It seemed she didn't know if her mother was alive or dead, but there didn't seem to be an immediate urgency since Star had been willing to go out of her way to save Morrun's wife. Or perhaps that's just who Star was and she would have done that even if it was urgent, but Ellesandra was unsure. She narrowed her eyes at Star, trying to give off an intimidating presence despite her smaller 5'1 form and the threat having no real backing to it, since she wouldn't hurt Star. "I'm not going to let you tire yourself out like that again unless it's absolutely necessary. I understand it was a magical exhaustion yesterday and you're much better after your rest, but with how bad it was I'm not sure you should be travelling on foot today."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star pouted a little, but she still listened to all Ellesandra had to say. Sure, she could use another day of rest. But... "Mmmnh, it's not absolutely necessary, no.." she conceded. "It just...Feels wrong to be idle without just cause. Obviously the cause of rest is important, but.." There was nothing to follow the but. She obviously saw the wisdom in Ellesandra's words. The rest would be good for her. "Your legs should be rested, too, so I guess we'll have to. But will you at least let me tend to your wounds, if I'm agreeing to rest completely? My mana might as well go to some use," she said, trying and failing to put up any sort of attitude. Star was too sweet for any amount of pouting or dispute to be taken as angry. If Star actually got angry, it would be obvious. This was just...Pouty that she was being forced to be idle, forced to listen take the wise choice instead of the ambitious one. Sure, it could be that nothing happened on the road. But something just as easily could, and not being fully rested could be the difference between life and death on the road.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was glad Star relented to not start the journey today, though when she suggested she should heal them, Ellesandra frowned again. The idea was reasonable, but she didn't know that she wanted to risk Star using her magic right now. She tilted her head to the side, considering. "This evening before you go to bed, IF you are absolutely confident your energy has restored and will be fine if you do it, you may tend to my wounds. Otherwise they're fine; I've received much worse than that without being treated for much longer, and I've treated these to ensure the bleeding stopped and they were disinfected. Additionally, they aren't even that deep, so no sewing necessary." While it was true that they weren't bad injuries, it was also true that Ellesandra wouldn't want to have to fight again with them still. It would effect her ease of movement, but only a little. Enough to allow Star to heal them? Maybe, only if Star was confident in her recovery of mana.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun had a bit of a smirk about him as he listened to the two go back and forth, but remained silent about it. Star focused on Ellesandra, not able to see the wayward smirking. "Deal," said Star, then shot a smile at Ellesandra. "...So what do you want to do until then, Ellesandra? I mean as fun as I'm sure guarding the door against all the law abiding civilians out there is, there's no reason we have to just sit on our butts all day, right?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a flicker of amusement in Ellesandra. On her face she didn't show it, not even a curling at the corner of her mouth, but Star would be able to see that the question and poking fun at her guarding the door amused her nonetheless. She sighed, as if very put upon, and said - "Well, I guess we can walk around and explore the settlement. I've been many places but I've not been to an elven settlement like this before, most of my interactions with your kind -" She had begun looking at Morrun as she said this, but paused as she realized how that might have sounded. There was an internal self-kick and a wince. "Er, I mean. I didn't interact with Elves much, and the trees are beautiful." That was a weak recovery, but there had been no malicious intent in the comment. Instead, it was more just an inexperience with elves in their natural culture, versus when they'd already assimilated into other nations or cultures.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star seemed pleased with the idea of walking around among nature. And smiled even brighter when she saw the amusement rise in her companion. So they did have a sense of humour after all. How pleasant.~ Star then watched with second-hand cringe as Ellesandra said 'your kind'. Morrun didn't seem put off by it in the slightest, however, even with the weak recovery. A shrug was all he had to offer. "Elves are not everywhere. Our connection to the Feywilds ensures we always maintain reverence for nature, though it's nothing compared to that of a Druid camp. The magic they can cultivate for natural splendor is unparalleled. But it's true, we do invest our time caring for the nature here. Lissana does much more with that than I do, though, as she learned to speak with animals at a young age," he explained. Star giggled at this, though she didn't explain why. Maybe she just found it cute to imagine Lissana talking about her day to a squirrel. Star then rose from her seat to stretch. "Mmnh, well, we'll leave you for now then," said Star. Morrun nodded. "Dinner will be at sundown, I invite you both to join us, please," he said, smiling again. Star nodded back, then moved to Ellesandra, ready to move out the door and go walk around for a while on their day off following their heroic rescue. Though, once the two did move out of the home and the door was closed, Star abruptly turned to pull Ellesandra into a hug. "...Thank you, Ellesandra." The sharing of physical emotions that came with physical contact of course came along with this, and within Star's heart there was...Overwhelming gratitude, all of it for Ellesandra.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked at Star with confusion when Star giggled in regards to Lissanna speaking with animals. She wasn't quite sure what was funny about that, looking back at Lissana, before shrugging and following Star out the door. She had started to turn to Star to see if there was anywhere in particular the mage wanted to go when she felt Star abruptly pull her into a hug. Ellesandra froze, statue still. Her arms were out to the side like someone who had gotten hugged and been surprised by it, and she was looking at Star with wide eyes. The feeling of Star's appreciation, gratitude flooded her and kept her rooted to the spot, and it took her a moment to realize what was happening and recover from her shock. When she did, the barrier on her emotions that she'd worked at maintaining all day yesterday, while carrying Star, slammed back in place to prevent Star's emotions from piling in and calming her again. She took a deep breath and lightly wrapped one arm around Star, patting her back in the awkward 'there there' motion of anyone who was unused to physical touch like this. "...Come on." She said, motioning with her head down the path for them to begin their exploration of the area. She felt awkward and confused with Star hugging her, and she could feel the way it caused her heart to skip a beat and the guilt and grief that began to stir much further down. She didn't want the hug to continue, but she didn't push Star away, either.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a small worry in Star's heart that she might get pushed away. The worry would pass along, though the reason for it would remain nebulous to the knight. Just another emotion in the chaotic storm of emotion that they were exposed to when touching Star. A storm that would be difficult to unravel for even someone well versed in their own emotions, so for Ellesandra? It all remained a confusing mystery until it was blocked off. Curiously, the act of drawing the division was easier on this day. It appeared to be a skill one could hone as they grew more familiar with Star's magic. A skill that would allow them to either better make sense of the chaos and noise in her emotions, or to block her out more completely. Control, in essence, was afforded with exposure. Marginal for now, but noticeable. Ultimately, Star held the hug for a short while, concluding it with a gentle squeeze, and parted with a smile. Star obviously could tell that it was difficult for Ellesandra. The discomfort, as if a hug was alien to them, had Star wearing sympathy and understanding upon her features as hands daintily folded behind her back. "...For staying," she began. "For walking beside me, instead of continuing on your own path." She then wore a brighter, happier, slightly playful smile. "...And for the blueberries." A giggle followed. "I guess it's pretty obvious how they are my favourite, isn't it? You probably felt like it was nothing. But in both the small and big moments, I have seen nothing but kindness in you. And it makes me really happy to know you." She let those words linger for a moment, hanging in the air. She debated speaking in terms Ellesandra understood, in saying her piece and then abruptly changing the subject to deter the other person from saying anything about it. On one hand, she considered that a kindness for the knight, to not force them to face the genuine emotion in Star's words. But on the other, she feared that saying what she had, and then immediately setting off to wander around like nothing happened would stifle Ellesandra further and reinforce the notion that emotions weren't a conversation, but just a series of random statements said at will and not to be discussed further. So, she elected to leave the silence to linger, so Ellesandra could decide how they wished to respond. She expected them to just clear their throat and pick a direction to start walking, and if that is what happened, she would be fine with it. But on the small chance Ellesandra had a response, Star didn't want to take away their chance to say it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pursed her lips together, eyeing Star when she finally pulled back with that gentle squeeze. There was part of her that immediately missed the contact. The part of her that had been touch starved for years now, having little to no real physical contact with people. Even when she'd taken lovers the past few years, it had been her touching them - not much of the other way around. The thought was pushed out of their mind and Ellesandra turned to look down the path, not meeting Star's eyes at all the thanks, and the comment about her kindness. She took the desire to be touched again and shoved it down, letting that discomfort with the whole situation be the main emotion Star would see - or at least, that's what she tried to do. She had no idea how much Star could see, or if other large emotions blocked sight to the smaller ones. "Yes, well." She said, clearing her throat awkwardly. Changing her plan for the money Morrun gave her for them both, she reached for the pouch that had it and unhooked it, tossing it over to Star. "I've been paid for my services, and part of that is making sure my client is happy. If blueberries make you happy, it is my duty to provide." It was a cop out. A guise to hide behind, in that her kindness or actually wanting to protect Star wasn't true, but just the job and the duty expected of her. Hiding behind duty was easy, even if a five year old could see through the lie. As the one hiding, it helped ease Ellesandra's emotions to think of it this way. "Morrun paid us for the rescue. I took my pay, the rest is yours to use." This also wasn't true. She hadn't taken but one platinum out of there, to use for her inn room last night and to test to ensure that the coin was good. Of course the platinum had been overpaying and she'd gotten change in gold but still. Ellesandra didn't even consider how easy it was for Star to tell she was lying, that thought not even being a consideration as she began walking away from Morrun's house, choosing that moment to go with the 'end the conversation and walk' path. "Lets go see the sights, it's not every day you get to roam an elven settlement."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had a bit of a fumbling reaction to catching the coin purse. Her hands were behind her when it was thrown at her after all, but she did catch it. She frowned, looking at the coin in the bag. Then went wide-eyed. That was...A lot of money. It became quite a bit less so when dealing in magical items which could gobble up the wealth for just a few modestly useful things, or even all on one single thing of modest value or rarity. She then looked at the house Morrun and Lissana owned. Guild began to rise in her own self. Not something Ellesandra would be able to see on her aura, but certainly on her face. Of course, the only thing she could think of with this is how much it could improve the lives of the elven couple. "I'll take a few coins and return the rest, then, since you've taken your pay," she said aloud, quite thoroughly justifying Morrun's intuition to pay Ellesandra. Goodness knew that what Star 'needed' was a paltry sum out of the pile. Five coins maybe. And not that Star knew it, but doing so would certainly expose Ellesandra's lie about taking their pay. And that didn't even begin to touch upon the way Star looked at Ellesandra after this statement with a face that clearly said 'if you're going to lie to me at least make it convincing' as she considered the cop-out line about blueberries. It was almost enough to get Star to lash out at them. But she'd only known Ellesandra a day. She feared being too insistent on the matters of emotion, about insisting on honesty, would push them away. She had, less than an hour ago, learned that Ellesandra was staying with her until she concluded her mission. A promise that...She wasn't sure Ellesandra fully understood, given how long Star had been at this already. But one she desperately needed. So she swallowed her emotions and simply said, as Ellesandra was walking away: "...There is no mountain." She then drew in a deep breath, huffed through her nose, and turned to catch up with the knight. Curiously, the pouch of coins was nowhere to be seen. Star also didn't carry a pack, as Ellesandra would have noticed while they were moving from Cloverport to the elven settlement. Did she lose it? Where were her supplies? Did she toss the coins into Morrun's home when Ellesandra wasn't looking? She just had her dress, as if that were her only possession. That all aside, she walked beside the knight in their plainclothes. The settlement was of decent size, but more vertically sprawling than horizontally so. The exploration revealed a fair amount of services the elves had; a smithy with a few workers, several bakers, artisans, a small library, a small prison, and a handful of other sorts. There didn't seem to be any sort of tavern or analogue for it, though there was a shop selling fine elven wines, some aged upwards of fifty, even a hundred years if the two poked their head in to peruse the wares. It was decidedly civilian, with enough similarity to human settlements to make it feel familiar. Beyond the services, however, there were communal spaces for the elves to gather. Places for them to be together, be merry, to sing and to dance, places to hone their accuracy with bows and form with blades. A place for the children to learn and be safe. The occasional elf regarded the two humans walking among them with curiosity. Another, with knit brows. Racial lines did breed strife on occasion, but as Morrun promised, there was no overt hostility. A few hours passed as they traveled around, taking in the sights and sounds, though it all carried a familiarity that prevented anything from standing out enough to linger on. They were just finding ways to idle the hours away, it seemed. That was until they found their way to the far side of the settlement, which had a bountiful garden to behold. Star's eyes went wide, and she sped along ahead of Ellesandra to step onto the walking path laid out with mosaic stones that passed between two rows of flowerbeds that were adorned with flowers and flora of all colours and sorts. Rainbows of blooms arranged with careful precision that sought perfection in the craft. The stone path led forward onto an open, grassy field that had patches of flowers dotting the greenery. It was a beautiful meadow, one that Star giggled with glee as she ran into, did a pleasant, happy spin on one leg, then let herself fall onto her back onto the soft earth. The sun glittered down onto the meadow, casting god rays through the trees to illuminate it in its warm glow. Some other elves were in the distance in this large meadow, keeping to themselves and simply living among nature. But at least for the moment, Star was occupying a little slice of the meadow to herself, obviously elated by the natural beauty on display.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned at Star's comment about returning the rest. "Take at least half. If nothing else you can find uses to donate it to on the journey." The request was made as more of a suggestion. She would prefer Star have the funds necessary to ensure safe travels, though also knew that Star would want to use the money for other kind acts in the future. She could spread that out, leaving some for the elven couple and then using it on the road as well. The no mountain comment made her visibly flinch. Her teeth gritted and anger rose, anger and denial swirling around the mountain that was obviously there, even if hidden and ignored by Ellesandra herself. This made the first part of their journey through the town not very pleasant for Ellesandra, working to rein in said anger and focusing more on that than enjoying the sights around them. The smell of the bakery got her attention, that and the smithy were the main things Ellesandra was looking at when not doing base scans for danger. Despite this being essentially a day off for them, she was still with her charge and thus needed to ensure no surprises were waiting. Ellesandra was quiet on the little tour of the town, impressed with the way they integrated their entire culture into nature but otherwise it seemed just like any other town. When they made it to the gardens and the meadow, she was taken aback by how much Star seemed to enjoy it. Running forward and spinning in the fields, Ellesandra found herself watching the just pure unfiltered joy in star with envy. She didn't remember the last time she'd been able to feel joy like that. A sinking feeling sat in her chest again, one she couldn't identify. Loneliness and regret was there, but it had been long enough that Ellesandra let herself feel either in this context that she didn't even realize what it was. Instead, she found a bench or a stump or something to sit on and settled down, watching Star just laying back in the meadow for a moment, before glancing around to see if there was anyone else around they might be disturbing. Keeping guard, like normal, with the same stoic expression as always despite the aforementioned feelings getting stronger.

Star hadn't seemed too keen on the idea of taking half. As kind as Star was, she had moments of being stubborn. The coin bag was gone, either way. Star literally could not help noticing the anger, but she didn't speak to it. She did think on it, however. And happy as she was, there was a desire to share it with her dutiful knight. Sure, it was possible there was danger, but they had been assured this place was safe. And it wasn't like Ellesandra was in their armor right now. Not that she'd want to take them on in a fist fight regardless, and felt pity for anyone who tried, but there was a mild poutiness about Star with how Ellesandra didn't have an off switch. "Hey, Ellesandra, get off your stump and come lay in the grass with me!" she called out, briefly propped up on her arms. She pat the grass next to her, then smiled. "It's a beautiful day!"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had sat on the stump just as much to keep distance from Star as to keep an eye out. Yet when Star propped up on her arms to invite her out, Ellesandra stared at her with a mixture of confusion and amusement. Why did Star want her to spend time with her like this? Ellesandra had proven to be a grumpy, unfun person so far hadn't she? Yet Star continued to try to pull her in. She didn't answer for a moment, watching Star and then glancing around the fields, before sighing in acceptance and standing. "As you wish, Miss Lumina." She could still hide behind the job, doing what her client wanted, in the form of her acceptance here. She walked forward, careful not to crush any of the flowers in the meadow - or as careful as she could be, anyways. She turned and lowered herself to sit next to Star's laying form. She didn't lay down, but did lean back on her own elbows, looking up at the sky rather than at Star next to her. "It is a beautiful day." She relented, agreeing with the comment.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star paid particular attention to how Ellesandra didn't trample the flowers. It made her smile, though from the knight's point of view she was just smiling because, well, Star did smile a lot. She was a happy person, generally. Until something sad happened. Then she was sad. As if she had some sort of empathetic magic or something. But she did happily welcome the other to her side. She knew touching them was...Not the knight's favourite activity, so she refrained from helping herself to using their lap as a pillow, despite the urge. Instead, she laid back, hands resting over her abdomen. "You can just call me Star, you know. I keep waffling about matching your formality and using your last name and saying that's silly and just using your first name. I've decided to just use your first name. So you should do the same." She smiled. "My mom gave it to me, after all. Picked it specifically for me. Be awfully rude not to make use of it, don't'cha think?" she asked with a playful voice, looking up at her companion. It was flimsy logic, but she clearly knew as much and just wanted to be called by her first name regardless.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a sudden pain that rose in Ellesandra's emotions at the mention of Star's mother giving her her name. It was enough that Ellesandra actually showed a response on her face, eyebrows coming together and her mouth creasing into a frown. She still didn't look at Star, remaining in her position until it became uncomfortable on her arms, and then leaning back entirely to lay down in the grass. She wasn't quite sure how to respond at first, wanting to decline Star's invitation to use her first name, but not knowing how to do so without insulting or offending the woman - or her mother, considering what Star had just said. So instead she pushed the memories of her childhood back down so the pain wasn't up front again, and nodded. "As you wish, Star." Her words were a whisper. A gentle give to the formality that normally was insisted upon to keep an appropriate distance between her and a client; something that she couldn't find she could enforce with Star. Star just had too much positive energy and happiness to deny her something so simple. She took a moment to glance around, not letting her guard down despite laying in the grass with Star, before looking back up to the sky. "Must be beautiful here at night, with the stars." A topic change. Still something more than she normally would have commented on, but it was a give and take. Give that, prevent questioning into the pain that she knew Star probably saw at the mention of a mother giving a child their name. Just another part of that mountain which didn't exist.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was smiling at first, but then frowned when she saw Ellesandra do the same. She had touched something there, hadn't she? She couldn't know, of course. Only know the other woman's hurt. She knew the knight's game by now. Every comment was calculated. It was a difficult topic to broach...She still didn't want to risk pushing the other woman away with inquisition. So she went along, this time. She would have to choose her moment, if she ever intended to try and chip away at the cold armor on Ellesandra's heart. "It's what I was named after. My mother's name is Aurora. My grandmother was Luna. Great grandmother, Aelia., which means 'sun'. My home has a lot of connection with the celestial bodies. The beauty and mystic grace of it all...My mother told me of how it is the destiny of my family line to bring light into the lives of others. She told me a story of how a single, guiding, bright star in the sky guided her to the woman she'd eventually come to marry. My...Other mother, Robin, didn't survive until I was born, I know that much. But my mom, Aurora...She said that I was that star that guided her, and descended from the heavens to be with her once I did." She giggled, tears having formed in her eyes. She was smiling, but...It was clearly painful to talk about, given the situation. "So every time I look up at the stars, I make sure to look for any bright ones. See if maybe there's something up there trying to guide me." She sniffled. "I know it sounds silly. But since we'll be here for the rest of the day...Let's come back here to look at the stars tonight, once the sun sets. See how beautiful it really is."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over at Star when she heard the sniffle. She eyed the water building in Star's eyes, and without a word slid her hand into a pocket and pulled out a handkerchief. It was silver with gold threaded emboss on it, of the same type of designs as was on her armor. There were initials on it, M.K., in the center. It looked relatively fancy, especially for something that the knight would be carrying around. She handed it over to Star to use to help dry her eyes before looking back up to the sky. "That's a lovely story." The response seemed...well, Ellesandra had more to say, there was more that she could say, but she didn't. It was all withheld, restrained. Instead, Ellesandra leaned her head back into the grass with a deep sigh, closing her eyes. "Returning tonight sounds like a great idea." They could probably return after having dinner with Morrun and Lissana, since they'd been invited there. Ellesandra wasn't sure about imposing on their hospitality more, but it seemed like it would be rude to refuse. Even if she was staying in the Inn rather than their place, with all her stuff still back in her room at the Inn, refusing their food seemed unnecessary. "Have you found any bright stars up there, guiding you?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
If Star didn't have the intuition to know that Ellesandra felt more than they let on, she might be offended by the curt response to her story. She accepted the handkerchief and did use it to dry her eyes, then admired the stitching on it. She sniffled again. "This is...Really nice," she said, taking note of the initials. M.K...Unless Ellesandra had a completely different name, it wasn't theirs. So...Who did it belong to? Whatever the case, it was important enough to keep, so Star would not dare sully it with anything more than a few teardrops. She held it gently, with a clear reverence, as if she implicitly knew it was very important to the knight at her side. Not much could get past her in that regard, after all. So it was handed back with care once she was done with it. Even if her eyes were still a bit wet, she dare not use it more. Then, the later question evoked a small nod. "I did, once. It led me to Nina. She's been a very good friend over the years, and that's a story you might find familiar, as I found her in the midst of peril and saved her. She's returned the favour plenty over the years I've known her. And she found love, or at least...For a while, she did." Star shook her head. More to the story, clearly, but not important enough to get into. "Of course I know it's just a silly coincidence. But there's something to be said about it happening twice. Maybe it'll happen again. Maybe it'll happen enough times that I'll have a much harder time just believing it coincidence."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The comment about the handkerchief being nice was ignored, at least verbally. Ellesandra obviously heard it because the grief, and the guilt, all hidden beneath the large mountain of repression Ellesandra had, leaked out a little. Marigolds handkerchief was the only physical thing Ellesandra had left of her, so yes it was quite important to her. She kept the conversation going beyond that though, ensuring that her talent at avoiding those conversations didn't go unused. She glanced over at Star, curious as the story was told. She wasn't certain, but she'd gotten the impression Star and this Nina might have been involved themselves, at least as much as you might with a travelling companion in a friends with benefits way. The indication that Nina had found love, at least for a time, made Ellesandra curious how Star felt about that. She didn't ask though; it wasn't Ellesandra's place to ask probing questions when she herself would refuse to answer any similar ones. "Maybe it will. Even if it doesn't happen again, doesn't mean that it was coincidence. The gods and goddesses work in weird ways, and with how your entire family seems to be named after and related to the stars or celestial bodies in some way, I wouldn't put it past the appropriate Deities finding favor within your family and sending you messages that way. Or just playing around with you."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The confirmation that the handkerchief was important came not from a physical tell, but, as was often with Star, an emotional one. Good that she was careful with it. A rag, she might have blown her nose on. Never would she dare use that precious keepsake for anything in the future, even dabbing her eyes. She sniffled again, then giggled. "I would hope they aren't playing around with me, if that is the case," she said, then looked back up to the skies. "...Have you ever had anything like that, Ellesandra? Anything that seemed to be like a coincidence? I mean...Other than you stumbling across me being in danger, of course. I have to wonder how much fate had a hand in that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged. "It's luck, or it's fated by the gods. And I don't much care for putting my life and my destiny in the hands of the gods; spiteful prideful beings who would use people like us and then throw us away. So there have been times that I've been lucky; I've gotten very luck in my life time, being able to be trained where I was and accepted into their ranks." Her comment was offhand, vague enough that Star wouldn't be able to get too much detail from it, but it would be obvious from her that what Ellesandra mentioned was something that she'd been grateful for, at the time. She still felt grateful, for whatever she was referencing, even if there was still pain in the memory. She waved her hand, dismissing the notion and idea. "Things happen, if they're fated then no point in fighting that, but if they're not then I'm going to make my own decisions and let luck and coincidence fall where it may."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star listened quietly, keeping an eye on the woman for their emotions as the story went on. Gratitude was a nice emotion to see. It had her smiling, though she could only imagine that such gratitude came from an upbringing that was more destitute. A person born in privilege feels they deserve everything they get, after all. She didn't mention this, but she made the quiet assumption to be confirmed some other time. "Quite the pragmatic view on it all. I've never been particularly pious, so I don't have much to say for or against the notion of the gods. I'll just have to take your word at their dispositions." There was an odd disconnect about bad stuff being gods and good stuff being luck, but again, she didn't say anything. "It's not surprising that you are someone who seeks to take control of their own destiny, though." She smiled. "We have that in common. I like that about you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra knew gods could bring about good stuff, too. They just hadn't for her, and it wasn't dependable. You could make your own good stuff. Most of what she'd seen the gods do had been negative, in some form of fashion. Not that she had much interaction with it at all, anyways, she was just biased. At the last comment, Ellesandra finally looked back over to Star and raised her eyebrows at her. "Take control of your own destiny? Didn't you just say that you were looking for a star that a deity would use to guide you to your next...I don't know. Lover, if that's what happened for your ancestors, or just friend?" She sounded amused a little. Maybe poking fun at Star, but only lightly and not seriously. Testing boundaries, more like, as she looked back up at the sky. "What do you have planned when you find your mother?" When, not if. She believed Star would find her mother, though if she was dead it might not be in the way Star wanted to find her. There was curiosity about how they got separated anyways, but again not something that Ellesandra was going to pry into.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was smiling bright as the two talked. It felt like for perhaps the first time, she was holding a conversation with Ellesandra that was about them, not just the situation they were in. Even at the subject of her mother, she didn't lose her smile. She giggled at the light prodding. "Just because I seek guidance where it might present itself doesn't mean I am not fighting for what I desire. I think I've proven that I'm not averse to taking risks. I think you'd be a lot less stressed out being near me if I was," she said, prodding back to the woman with a playful smile and lilt to her voice. "And, well...I've never been in love. Not aside from love for family, of course. Romantic love." She was still a virgin, but she wasn't about to go saying that out loud. "And not for lack of meeting people, mind. Maybe it's just the vagrancy, but...I've never felt that way about anyone before. I've felt...Attraction, certainly. Enough to know what kind of people I'm attracted to, though that's always been kept inside. Never uh...Told someone I, you know...N-Never mind. But I'll always take more friends. Making friends wherever I go is how I like it to be. As for my mother? Well....Depends on if she is alive of dead I guess. If she's gone, then I will just need to make sure I care for her legacy, and that she is properly set to rest. If she's alive...Then I never want to be separated from her again. N-Not, you know...Like live with her or something. Just make sure that I can see her regularly. Learn from her. Understand myself better," she said, looking down at herself as she did. A pensive introspection overtook her. "...You can't really know what it's like to be born like me, of course. I've had this gift since birth. Mom helped me understand it, but there was a lot I had to figure out on my own, too. It's...An intuitive thing. Not something that you can really explain. But certain things just click after you focus on them for a while. At first, I remember reading an aura was really hard. Just a...Chaotic barrage of emotions constantly. Lots of headaches, and trying to make sense of things that rejected understanding." An apt description of what Ellesandra felt, to a very mild degree, whenever touching Star as the power connected their auras. Confusing, despite the comfort. "But over time, little by little, having experiences with people helped me understand them, and understand me by extension. I've been lucky, too. Lucky that a lot of people have helped me, yourself certainly included. So...On one hand it's a little selfish of me, as my mother is the only person who can really help me with this in a way that isn't just me figuring it out myself. But that aside?" She closed her eyes. "...She's my mother. I love her. And she loves me. I know she would come for me, if she could. So either she is out there looking for me, and we haven't found each other...She's dead, and can't look for me...Or she needs help. Whatever the reason, I have to find her and know for sure. It's..." She paused, pursing her lips as her eyes opened again. "...Have you ever felt like...You can't move on with your life? Like something holds you back from doing that? For me, that's...This. I need this. Then...Then I can think about settling down and having a life that is more about me. And I hope to help a lot of people out along the way."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra listened as Star rambled about her lack of being in love, and her interactions with people as that. It caused her to raise her eyes again, but it was more curiosity as to why or how, and not judgment at Star's inexperience with love. It sounded like she might not have told someone she was attracted to them, either, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. It certainly wasn't her place to pry into how many people Star had been with, sexually. She was silent as Star transitioned into speaking about her mother, and what she'd do when finding her, and her powers. When Star asked that of her, though, she reached to the side and picked a single flower, holding it up above her head and slowly curling the stem round and round itself, up the stem until it created a much smaller stem that was stronger, but obviously different from how it had started. It curved to the side instead of going straight down, and Ellesandra picked another flower, curling it's stem around the first. She was making a circlet of flowers, though it would take quite a few more than just two, and she wasn't in a rush to complete it as they lie there. The silence stretched, the unspoken mountain rumbling with the pain, grief and guilt over what Ellesandra herself couldn't move past - what was holding her back. Her eyes were focused on the flowers in front of her as she worked, but the whispered words came out. So softly that Star might wonder if she'd imagined them. "There is no mountain." She clenched her jaw again, and suddenly crushed the start of the circlet in her fist, tossing it to the side and sitting up, back to where Star was laying. "You take risks like what you took for Morrun and Lissana, and you very well might not make it to finding your mother." Now her words were scolding, a defensiveness for the little she'd just opened up in and slammed that look into her emotions back down again, overcorrecting. "So don't let your helping others distract you from finding your mother, if you want to actually do so."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was quietly smiling as she saw Ellesandra weaving a circlet of flowers. It was cute. Though, she watched as the tranquility, brief as it was, was overtaken by defensive anger, frustration, and a myriad of other emotions swirling in the knight's aura. The flowers were crushed and the woman was defensively faced away from her. The words that followed didn't hurt Star, like they might have been meant to. She kept calm in the face of them. "I know," she said quietly. "But I...Like who I am. Not that I don't have my failings, of course. I've plenty of those. But I like...That I am not afraid of dying for a good cause. Obviously I'll try to do all I can to avoid that and...I know I have no business flinging myself at something I have no hope of surviving. I pick the fights I know I can take, even if I recognize I might get hurt along the way. Knowing what would have happened to Lissana if we hadn't intervened...I'd make the same decision a million out of a million times. There's...Enough suffering in this world that I am forced to turn a blind eye to. So...As much as I'm able to," she said, moving from laying to being on her knees. She then moved behind Ellesandra and, with as gentle a motion as she could, embraced the other woman from behind, looping her arms around their neck to hug their shoulders and collar. "I want to give people their smiles back when something has taken it away from them. I'm no miracle worker, but...It's a promise I keep to myself, that I will always do everything that I can." With that, she didn't wish to overstay her welcome. A small squeeze, then slowly retreated from Ellesandra, unless she saw reason to keep the hold.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't look at Star, even as the mage seemed to brush off her words. Her knees came up and she wrapped her arms around them, leaning forward away from her and staring out over the meadow. Her rapier was at her side, awkwardly putting pressure against her hip from the way it angled against the ground, but she didn't bother repositioning it. In a way, the discomfort that brought helped ground her. The thought came into her mind, that even if Star was willing to risk her own life for it, she might not understand how her death effected others too. She didn't say it, because it wasn't really Star who Ellesandra would be saying that too. It wasn't really Star that she was thinking it about. The grief bubbled up, enough that she'd been distracted to the point of not expecting Star's touch. The embrace caused her to jump, both physically and emotionally surprised at the touch. The calmness wasn't welcome right now and she pulled away, moving to stand as if she had been planning to do that the entire time and lightly pulling Star's hands off of her even in that quick squeeze. She took a few steps away and then stopped, unsure what to say. She was being dramatic, wasn't she? Shame, but she really didn't like how her emotions went haywire when around Star. And how when Star touched her, she was afraid Star would be able to see the memories associated with those emotions. Without a word, she returned to her stump, hiding behind her 'duty' again, and looking anywhere around them except at Star herself. She withheld the tears that were on the verge of springing to her eyes, but at the same time she knew that didn't matter with Star. Star would see the grief anyways, and that angered her. She couldn't even hide the emotions from the woman like she could everyone else, to get them to think she was just being moody and leave her alone.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Indeed, Star had to find a balance between respecting Ellesandra's boundaries and not allowing the obvious grief and anguish to go unanswered. That mountain was looking a whole lot more existent right now. She had been given a clear signal by them pulling away, but something...Beckoned Star to keep at it. She was confident Ellesandra wasn't going to hurt her, of course. She worried about losing their allyship, but...If she was willing to risk her own life for a stranger, she was willing to do at least as much for someone she had come to care about as a friend. So she followed to the stump. She sat, cross-legged, in front of Ellesandra, looking up at them. She didn't say anything for the moment. She just looked at them. Of course, Ellesandra knew that her looking at someone was almost always her looking at them.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected Star to follow her. Her lips pressed together in a firm line, frustration and irritation at Star's silent insistence. She knew Star wasn't just looking at her, was waiting for her to open up, or to be able to see and understand more about her emotions. "Stop it." The thought of Star staring at the emotions that she didn't even want to feel right now bothered her - a lot. Her feet came up to rest on the edge of the stump and her knees pressed to her chest, as if somehow putting her legs between herself and Star would prevent Star from seeing into her as well. It was ridiculous, but the instinct to protect and cover herself was still there. She felt naked, exposed beneath Star's gaze and it was not something she was comfortable with right now. "I'm not going to talk about it, either." She added this, knowing that even if Star looked away, she might try to bring the topic up. Ellesandra found she still couldn't actually look down and meet Star's gaze. Instead, she held onto her knees and looked out over the field, the grief slowly being pushed down by the irritation and anger. Okay, maybe Star pushing it was good; it helped her focus on those emotions rather than the grief.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I'm not asking you to talk about the mountain that isn't there," she said, undeterred by Ellesandra's emotional response. "I just want to talk to you. I was enjoying that," she said, her words as honest-to-a-fault as ever. "If you insist that I leave you be I will but not until you listen to me." There was a firmness to her voice, one that spoke of emotional conviction. But she was still being gentle. She didn't want to actively anger the woman of course. But some emotional grit was to be expected with such a sensitive topic. "You decided to help me. You saved me from coming out of that a lot worse than I would have. Maybe even saved my life if things went terribly wrong. You stuck by me, and each time I was ready to let go of you, to not impose on you, you stayed beside me. Despite both of us knowing the dangers we were up against, you even stood by me as I pledged to help a man who was at the time a total stranger to us both. And from the moment I laid eyes on you I have seen..." She paused. "...You know what I've seen. And I'm still not going to press you on that, as much as it makes my heart bleed to pretend I don't see it. I know I don't afford the privacy of emotion that many are used to. I know it's hard to know someone sees it. But it's just as hard to be someone who sees someone so kind suffer. And before you try to hide behind some sort of honour that forces you to be the way you are, just...Remember what I see. Remember that I see through lies of even adept liars and...As kind as I can possibly say it, you're not a very good liar," she said, offering a smile at that. Her words might have conviction to them, but she did her best to remain gentle. "So I'm...Not asking you to confide in me, not asking you to spill secrets to me. I'm just asking you to...Hear me when I tell you it's hard to fight against every fiber of my heart that begs me to see what's right in front me, but I do it because you asked me to. But I have to draw the line, Ellesandra. When it gets to be too much, I...Don't need you to open up about it. I just want to be able to support you. We can talk about anything else, if it helps. Because it just...Isn't fair that you can be there for me, constantly, when I need you, which has been far more times in one day than I care to admit...And I'm not allowed to do anything at all for you in return. You went and stepped into my life and now you've got me caring about you. And if I'm willing to risk my life for a stranger, just imagine what I'll do for a friend, let alone one who saved my life." She looked at Ellesandra, pleading with her eyes. "...Just let me be here with you and talk about...Birds, or flowers...Anything."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned. The mountain wasn't there, but Star kept mentioning it. To be fair, Ellesandra mentioned it just a few moments ago, too. With a deep breath, she put her chin on the top of her knees and closed her eyes, hearing the firmness of Star's voice. She wouldn't give this up, and pushing back would either start an argument or Ellesandra would have to simply walk away. And if she walked away, what would happen to Star? She wouldn't be able to live with herself if something happened to the mage that Ellesandra could have stopped, but she just walked away because being in Star's presence was hard. The dream came back to her and irritation rose in her once again. It took a few moments, and honestly with the words that Star cared about her making it easier, Ellesandra calmed herself down. She resigned herself to having to deal with Star knowing that she hurt, but she didn't need to know why. "Fine. You can see it, but the topic is off limits. That is a firm boundary, Mi-...Star. You will not pry, or try to trick me into talking about things that I have no desire to relive or discuss." She opened her eyes, looking back down to Star. These weren't requests. They were clear statements that if Star didn't think she could follow, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could travel alongside the mage. Regret and fear came up at that, worried that Star would refuse and Ellesandra might be forced to face the dream she'd had again. The guilt at someone dying because of her inaction. "And give me the handkerchief back, if you're done with it." Ellesandra hadn't forgotten it. She didn't care if Star's tears or even snot was on it; she'd clean it the next opportunity she had, but she didn't want to let Star just keep it for now. Especially not with the tension between them and the current irritation at Ellesandra feeling like that mountain, which she always pretended wasn't there, kept getting poked by Star's comments, brought back to life, and Ellesandra was not prepared for the emotional onslaught that would be once she stopped repressing it entirely.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star blinked, looking at her hand to find she was holding onto it. "Oh, erm...S-Sorry. I meant to give it back," she said, handing it back. It only had two tiny tear spots on it which were mostly dry. She heard the 'Mi', and upon handing the handkerchief back, was reminded of the initials. Was she...Being associated with someone from Ellesandra's past? She couldn't know. And she wouldn't ask. "Ellesandra...I said right when we got onto the road together that I wasn't going to press you on this. Do I...Want to know? Of course. But I'm not going to force you. Being who I am, I've had to learn when it is appropriate to...Make use of the knowledge I have from the power. I'm not perfect of course but...I at least have tact enough that if someone says they don't want to talk about something...All I can do is just say...I'm here, if they change their mind. And that I do want to help. But that's all I can do. And I would hope it had gone without saying but...I'll say it so you can hear it: I'm not going to trick you. I'm not going to mislead you, lie to you, intentionally lead you along some conversation path hoping you'll slip and tell me something you don't want to talk about..." She shook her head. "If you ever, ever feel comfortable talking about whatever it is...I want it to be genuine. I want it to be only because you want to share with me, and no other reason. It would make feel sick if you ever felt I was...Manipulating you. I told you I...Only ever will be honest with you. Even if the truth isn't pleasant, or what you want to hear. It will always be the truth, and I will always hold the best intentions towards you. I swear this, all of it."

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She took the handkerchief back. A second was taken, running her thumb across the initials, before she folded it up neatly and slipped it back into her pocket. The grief and guilt, so intertwined, threatened to rise again. They were pushed down and she folded the handkerchief up, putting it back in her pocket and moving to sit up right on the stump again, feet on the ground once more. "Good." It was the only thing Star would get in response to all of her confirmation and reassurance that she wouldn't pry. That she wouldn't try to manipulate or trick information out of Ellesandra. Ellesandra was uncomfortable with Star being able to see her emotions, but there wasn't anything she could do about that. Setting this boundary, verbally and getting agreement on it rather than just assuming Star was too good of a person to push on it, was important for her. She looked down at Star for a moment, then stood. "Lets continue walking." She needed to get away from where they just were, where she'd felt so raw there for a moment. Whether or not Star followed, Ellesandra moved back onto the path and began just walking alongside the meadow, not necessarily leaving it but not going to lay back down in the flowers, either. Movement felt needed, to help process and distract herself, so that's what she was doing. "So, recap our next destination and travel plans for me, assuming you are fully recovered tomorrow and good to start the journey?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star loosed a soft breath, glad that they reached an agreement. She obviously could tell there was more pain lingering, but all she asked was that they keep together and not fall silent. She got at least that much, made clear as they got up. She joined them, walking alongside. The question had her recounting the details. "I'll be having Morrun mark my map with where we'll be going. It'll be about two days of walking north, hopefully without any major issues. From there, we need to find details, clues. Find some information about these people Morrun said he saw, who come from Myst. Or in general just...Get to Myst, however we can. From Myst, he believes we can get to my home again. Once we're in my home...There will be a lot of work to do to find out what happened, starting with the...Ruins of what was once my home."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"Ruins of what it once was? What happened to it?" Ellesandra led them on a path that seemed to run alongside this meadow for a while, but when they got to the end of it, she turned around and began walking back down it. The meadow was beautiful, and Star had obviously enjoyed it, so she didn't want to just walk away and prevent the feel of the nature and the environment from being enjoyed. She needed to move, but no reason it couldn't just be along this path. A glance was given over to Star at the question, but she didn't push. Just like she'd requested of Star, if that type of information was painful for her or she didn't want to discuss it, who was Ellesandra to push on it?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Unlike Ellesandra, Star was an open book to her companion. She wore a smile, but it was...A sorrowful one. "It's how I got separated from my mother in the first place. We were attacked. My mother was known in our region as a powerful magic user, and I was a little too young at the time to really understand it all, but...I think it's fair to say that she attracted some powerful enemies. My mother ran with me, we tried to escape as the other magi held off the attack. But they pursued. Laid waste. Razed our village. I remember flames and blood falling from the sky." She paused here, looking over the beauty of the natural land as she kept walking with her companion. "I remember seeing the fear in my mother, in her aura. She was the strongest, so...She had to fight. But she also had to guard me. The choice of being idle and protecting me, or going out and saving anyone she could from our village. Those are the conflicting emotions I remember seeing in her. I told her to send me away, for her enemies did not know she bore a daughter. It was the only way she could protect me, for if she fought and died, or the enemy retreated with knowledge of me, I would always be in danger from them." She closed her eyes for a moment, holding down her sorrow. Then opened them again. "So she did. She opened a gate and sent me through it. It was a plan made in the moment. She sent me far, far away, and I had...Hoped she would be able to follow me afterwards." Her voice was starting to get a bit stiff, a bit choked. "But a day turned into a week, which turned into a month, then two, then six, then a year, two, five, ten..." She shuddered, closing her eyes tight. Tears streaked down her cheeks. "I don't want her to be dead, Ellesandra...I don't. I don't want her to have died fighting for us all. I don't want to have to regret not begging her to come with me, even knowing the evils would have followed her." She choked a sob. "...So please do not warn me of what I already know...That the enemy may be waiting for me there. I need to do this. With all that I am, I need to return to her side. And I need to pray with all that I am that she still lives..."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected all of...that. When she'd heard the first choking noise, she stopped, turning to look at Star. Regret filled her, at asking this question and making Star relive this. She shouldn't have, and as she saw how much it effected Star, she couldn't help but try to fix it. The thing is, she didn't know how to. She looked around, as if suddenly, magically, someone else would appear to comfort Star. To say the right thing, and make her feel better. She'd never been good at this, not even before the mountain was there. Looking back to Star she wavered for a moment, and then stepped forward. She had her barrier in place, to try her best to block the sorrow that was evident in Star's face from hitting her at the touch, but she would offer her arms for Star if she wanted the hug. She did not touch Star first, though. She made the offer and indication apparent, arms spread and ready to wrap around Star if she decided to lean into the embrace, but she knew enough about Star's ability by now that she wouldn't touch Star without her permission in this situation. It may not be an emotion Star wanted to share, and even if Ellesandra was guarding against it, with something this strong could she not feel it at all? Her face was conflicted, and there was definite hesitation in the offer, but if Star needed a shoulder to cry on, Ellesandra would be it. "I won't warn you." Ellesandra said, even though she had thought that. "No matter what is waiting there or not, we will find it and see what happened to your mother." If Star did accept the embrace, she would wrap her arms around the mage and guide her head onto her shoulder, lightly squeezing. Awkward, but still supportive.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra might be the sort to be hesitant to physical touch, but Star was the complete opposite. The moment a hug was offered, she went flush against them, the comfort evident as her aura connected to Ellesandra. The raw sorrow was there. But it was an emotion Ellesandra could know was not their own. Putting up a barrier kept some of it out, but it was too powerful to avoid the sensation entirely. It did not evoke sadness in Ellesandra specifically. But just with all the other emotions, it was there, able to be reached out to. It was quite like seeing Star cry, except it was Ellesandra's heart, the core of their emotion, 'seeing' Star's sadness. It was a visceral feeling. If Ellesandra cared about Star, then genuine sorrow was a natural consequence. Nobody liked to see someone they cared about sad, and this connection only amplified that. Of course...Not everyone reacted the same way to sorrows. Perhaps, instead, that raw sadness would evoke...Protectiveness. Anger, at the ones who caused this sorrow. Or perhaps even courage, to stand up against the sorrow and be the devout rock that supported Star. Her power was not manipulative. It simply...Connected their hearts together. With happiness, it was often infectious. With the tranquility of her aura, it simply spread through the other. But there was much less tranquility to find in this moment. Her sadness, even with the guards held, was...Intense. A sorrow that ripped her apart inside, enough to overcome her and leave her shaking. Yet, Ellesandra could feel the way that the hug gave Star comfort. Without a word, it was communicated how the knight's embrace was like a dam against the tsunami. Star managed to wrangle her emotion enough to keep her sobs minimal, and it would be something that Ellesandra would be able to glean insight into as she did so. To be able to see that Star felt far, far greater sadness than she showed on the surface, if Ellesandra allowed themselves to look, even briefly, into her heart. It stood to reason that an empath was in great control of their own emotions, and yet the sadness was potent enough to cut her to her core; she certainly would and did cry over lesser things, but this sadness was, in many ways, similar to what Ellesandra faced. A feeling that overpowered her. That coursed through her very soul. A shackle that held her. Paralyzed her. As Ellesandra held the weight of a fallen princess upon their shoulders, Star was burdened by the weight of the unknown fate of her own mother. Yet, she did not feel an ounce of anger, or regret, or any negative feeling towards Ellesandra. She did willingly share her story, the context of her adventure. Where the knight felt they had overstepped, Star held a small, thin thread of...Relief? Yes, the pain was deep. But she was able to express it, and there in Ellesandra's arms, the edge grew duller. The icy cage around her heart melted, just a little. Each moment Ellesandra held her, her heat managed to beat just a little warmer under the grips of this terrible memory. Star dare not take more than she was given, but...There was a clear, obvious desire to remain close to the knight. And if the stalwart knight did hold her long enough, it would allow Star to again find her center and level her breathing as sorrow slowly...Slowly, but surely...Gave way to gratitude, and a deepened bond with the woman who held her.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took in a deep breath at the sorrow that she felt through the embrace as soon as it happened. Even through her emotional wall, she could feel how sad this memory and what happened made Star. It felt extremely odd, seeing this, and she wondered if that was how Star experienced Ellesandra's emotions when she looked at her. Ellesandra did feel that protectiveness come up, the desire to ensure that Star didn't feel this way again - to protect her from the feeling that she was trying so hard to protect herself from, too. Anger wasn't a big part of it, only a bit of anger at whoever did this but it was so background it likely wouldn't be noticed. Ellesandra slowly let her arms fully encircle Star and just held her, eventually reaching up and running a hand through the back of Star's hair. The desire to protect this woman was almost overwhelming, wanting to just squeeze the sadness right out of her and make her happy and jumping into the meadow again. Of course, Ellesandra couldn't do that - and wouldn't try. If anyone looked their way she gave them icy glares to ensure they kept to themselves and didn't interrupt as Star let out her sorrow. She didn't say anything, no soothing words or reassurances that most people would provide in this situation. She just held Star, letting her cry it out. Her own sorrow twinged in response to how much she'd seen and felt in Star, and how holding Star reminded her of holding Marigold, but she pushed it down. Unlike Star's sorrow where she couldn't just squeeze it out of the woman, she COULD just push her own sorrow down. And that totally got rid of it, right?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The hold that Star gave to Ellesandra was tight. What Star showed outwardly was not representative of the depths of this sorrow, that much Ellesandra would certainly feel. It ran deeper than choked sobs, tears, and needing a hug. It was the sort of sorrow that led the typical person to nightmares, to dangerous thoughts, to all the dangers of deep, all-consuming sadness. Guilt, as well, was significant and present. It wouldn't be hard to figure out why - Star likely felt personally responsible for all of this, whether it was true or not. Nobody bothered the two of them. If anyone saw it, they steered clear. Such was the polite thing to do, after all. Despite the darkness Star felt within her, she remained an empath. A master over emotion. So it wasn't long before she managed to subdue her sobs, regulate her breathing, and find a calmer place. Her hair which Ellesandra brushed their fingers through was...Remarkably soft. Silken threads of snowy white, pure and untainted by dirt or oils that would make the threads heavy or rough. "...Thank you," Star whispered from her place still holding Ellesandra, head against their shoulder. "I know you aren't the biggest fan of touching, because of what happens when we do. But it feels...Nice...To be held by you. I feel safe with you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra almost jumped when Star finally spoke. It had been obvious she'd been slowly bringing herself back together, but the whispering had surprised her. She squeezed tighter for a moment as Star spoke, and she had been just about to release Star, hold slackening and her body moving to let go, when she heard Star said that she felt safe with her. There was a pause where it felt like her own heart had sunk into her chest, words that had no ill intention whatsoever but obviously had a pretty severe impact on Ellesandra. She squeezed once more then stepped away, releasing Star and looking away from her. Her own eyes were misty now, and it had nothing to do with the sorrow she'd felt in her companion. Her jaw clenched and she reached for the handkerchief again, handing it over to Star for her now splotchy nose and eyes. She pressed it into Star's hand, if Star tried to refuse it. "Why don't we sit? Take some time to recover before you go back to Morrun's. He'll get the wrong idea if you come back looking like you're heartbroken." Star had been right. She hadn't liked the touching, and especially not when Star had said the last words she'd heard from Marigold. It took a lot of willpower to close up that wound again, looking away from Star who, while looking nothing like Marigold, reminded Ellesandra so much of her. Ellesandra couldn't continue to hold Star and risk her being able to get a better look into that emotion. She had mentioned before that for particularly powerful ones, she could sometimes see the memories associated with it - and THAT was not something Ellesandra was ready to share, verbally or otherwise. There was real fear on display in Ellesandra right now, fear that Star would be able to see straight through everything she was trying to pretend didn't happen. Everything that she refused to accept, in one way or another. Through that mountain that didn't exist. Without a word, Ellesandra made her way over to one of the benches alongside the meadow, sitting on the very far edge of it to give Star plenty of room without touching.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star did initially try to refuse the handkerchief. It being pressed firmly into her hand did force her to take it, though...She still didn't use it. She let her tears fall. They had slowed. But the odd sniffle and tear did still pass. She nodded lightly to Ellesandra, confused why the woman was so pained. Was it something she said? It must have been, but...She promised she wouldn't pry, and she would hold to that. The most she could do would assure Ellesandra she was present, that she was here for them, but she sincerely doubted Ellesandra had any major change of heart on the matter in the handful of minutes since Star had asserted that she wanted to know, but wouldn't press. So she moved to the bench, sitting next to but not touching Ellesandra. The bench looked over a clear pond of fresh water. Likely one of the main water sources for the grove. Star continued to not use the handkerchief. She instead just looked at it, brushing her thumb over the soft fabric. Obviously, the object didn't have any emotions for her to read, but her curiosity about it was clear. Despite that, she didn't ask about it or say a word about the clear mist she observed in the eyes of her companion, nor the strong emotions she observed in general. She was there if they wanted to talk but...She assumed they didn't. So she just spoke up about something else, as a way of reaffirming her promise to not force Ellesandra to speak about these things. "...Have you always trained with a rapier? Most knights I have met use longswords and shields. Not one to go with the popular choice, huh?" she put on a forced smile. She didn't even look at Ellesandra. Just kept looking at the embroidered cloth in her hands. The topic was random, of course. Just the first thing she could think to speak about that wasn't emotional. Something that let Ellesandra save face.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced over at Star, who appeared to just be examining the handkerchief. There was confusion as to why she wasn't using it; a frown crossing her face and looking up at Star's own face, before she shrugged it off and turned to look out over the lake. The question wasn't personal, at least on the surface. It was one Ellesandra thought she could answer, and still walk around the point that she didn't want to talk about. Her gaze ran along the water, silent for a few moments while planning out her response, not just speaking her mind immediately. Focusing on this task helped distract her, so even if Star hadn't intended it as a way to help, it was. "I did use spear and shield, for most of the time growing up. Eventually I dropped the shield as I became more talented with my magic; I needed a hand free to weave spells, but would keep the shield on my back for use between situations where I'd need it. I trained one of my charges with the rapier, though. She wanted to learn something that she could carry with her without it making her look...manly, she called it. Or improper. We talked about daggers that she could hide, but she wanted a weapon she could actually engage in sparring with, so we settled on a rapier." Ellesandra looked up at the clear sky, remembering that day with a wistful, sad smile. "I'm ambidextrous and she was left handed, so I taught her with my left hand so it was fairer for her to learn, easier for her to watch and emulate than if I used my right hand. In a later fight, I got wounded in my right arm pretty badly, and wasn't close to a healer to have them help repair it. Not to mention my particular, unique abilities make healing and restoration spells not as effective on me; a double edged sword, being particularly resistant to magic." The wistful smile had dropped from her face and she looked down to the lake, sighing. "I can use my right arm fine, but if I were to try to use it in a real fight, against anyone who had any strength or skill, it would be a liability. It doesn't do well with anything strenuous or heavy. So I picked up the rapier for myself in my left hand and use my right hand for my spells."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Had Star intended for it to be therapeutic? No real tell gave it away in her demeanour, but given how in tune she was with emotion, it would hardly be surprising if it was the truth. Being able to know just what to say to people seemed to be a somewhat consistent talent of hers, from what evidence had been shown in their time together thus far. She wore a more genuine smile as the explanation passed. "Resistant to magic? Must just be the arcane sort. I've felt no resistance to mine, though...Mine is rather unique, so I can't say it's too surprising. We'll have to see how well I can heal those wounds on your legs. It'll be important to know how effective my healing will be on you." She spoke forward, looking out at the water for a time, then back at the handkerchief. She smiled after a few moments of silence, presumably from something running around in her own mind. "I can only imagine the sight of you training someone. Or even a class of people. You have a...Presence about you. A conviction in your words that I think makes it easy for people to trust that you're being sincere." She seemed to be mostly thinking aloud with these words, as a question then followed: "Did you want to be a knight? You don't have to answer if it's too personal of course. I'm just...Curious about what small Ellesandra was like, and what eventually had you turning to a life of wandering. I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that somewhere in that life story are things that we aren't gonna talk about so...If it helps, leave whatever blanks are necessary. Unless you'd rather just not answer."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged at the resistant comment. The only spell, per say, that Star had cast that effected her was one that she hadn't needed anyways, and her absorption of it had been similar to the intended effect as it was. Star's more passive abilities, to see her emotions and share them via touch, weren't entirely the same. At least, that's why Ellesandra assumed they weren't the same thing; she certainly wasn't a magical scholar. The thought of her training a class of people made her shake her head, though. "A class of students would drive me crazy." Ellesandra liked structure, and too many students didn't. She wouldn't last for a week as a teacher to more than just one or two where she could tolerate and be patient with the sudden changes. "As for being a knight, it depends on the timeframe. I -" There was a pause, a mixture of relief, gratitude, and that grief rising back up to the surface again. "I was an orphan, so being a knight wasn't something I ever really considered, for a long time. When I was taken in, I wanted to help the family that did so. Being a knight just...lined up with how I could do that, and what I was good at." She shrugged, not moving on to how she turned to a life of wandering. That bit alone had already gotten closer to the mountain than Ellesandra was truly comfortable with, as evident by her left hand turning into a fist on her own thigh and her eyes turning away from Star. She didn't know why she fought so hard to prevent Star from seeing her tear up; Star could SEE the emotion, but it didn't matter. And like always, Ellesandra didn't let the grief or sorrow overwhelm and take hold of her. It was pushed back down. "Do what you're good at, right? That's how you make a life in the world. Find something you're good at and don't hate, and get people to pay you to do it."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
It was natural for Star to look at others, even if not just for the politeness of giving someone one's attention while they spoke. She didn't stare at them, didn't study them like she often did, however. She was trying to give Ellesandra a little space in that regard, though that she could see the strong force of guilt and sorrow that welled in them. She was tempted to reach out and comfort them by placing a hand on their shoulder, but...She had perceived in them that they didn't like her touch quite so much, given the effects that carried with it. It hurt. It hurt to know that something she relied on, something she wanted to do, to offer physical comfort, was unwanted. But she kept that hurt down, and managed to mask it in a way that wasn't typical for her. Ellesandra didn't have the same advantage as her, of course. It wasn't that she couldn't understand the hesitation. The desire to retain privacy. And it didn't matter that Star had the absolute best, brightest, most pure intentions. If Ellesandra didn't want to accept her desire to be closer, she had no choice but to respect that. And she would, even if she struggled to see someone in pain and not do anything about it. The thought of it, let alone actually doing it, tore her heart to shreds. So it was, her genuine smile that she had been wearing faded as she nodded to Ellesandra's words. A little more forced. A little more of a mask. For someone as expressive as Star, it wasn't hard to tell the difference. Others might not be able to see her emotions clearly, but she certainly didn't make it terribly challenging to read her like a book most of the time. She was trying to put on a smile for the knight, even if her heart felt like it was in a vice. "You're certainly good at helping people," she said, her voice a bit quieter now. She'd stopped crying and sniffling. Now it was just a...Looming cloud over her. A sorrow that clung to her and had not yet healed. "I'm sorry you had such suffering in your early years. I do hope you were brought in early in life...And that those who did take you in were loving and kind to you." Words, sincere as could be, spoken from a woman who, at some unknown young age, had been forced to fend for herself, based on the story she told.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged, latching onto the comment about suffering in early years. Thinking about that was easier than thinking about why she became a wandering knight, about everything surrounding it. "Nothing to be sorry for. I don't remember any of it. I think I was found when I was three? Four? They don't quite know how old I was, exactly, but too young to remember much from before that. As such, the day they found me was assigned as the anniversary of my birth, for future celebrations and such." A brief smile creased her face, thinking about a few of those, before she shook her head. "And they were more than kind to me." Up until the end, but Ellesandra didn't say that part. Taking a deep breath, she shook her head. "Why is it that you can pull emotions out of me that I haven't let myself experience in three years?" Three years, since it happened. She eyed Star a little suspiciously, as if somehow her magic was at fault for allowing her to just reach in and pluck them out. Straight past all of her guards and barriers. It was unfair, and that was just one of the reasons she wasn't comfortable with Star touching her. Considering that Star had no intention of using the handkerchief, as made obvious by her still just holding it, Ellesandra reached over for it again. She had no intention of offering it once more, with Star's refusal to put it to use. "I think we've been emotional enough for the day. What's next on the agenda, Miss-...Star?" This was Ellesandra trying her best to be polite in saying she wanted, no, needed the topic to change if they were going to talk. And move onto something lighter, something not herself preferably.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star smiled, genuinely again, hearing that those who took Ellesandra in were kind to her. Good parents. Yes. That was good. That was comforting, though some strange emotion flashed in Ellesandra with those words that Star couldn't place. Still...She didn't pry. She offered the handkerchief back when the knight reached for it. She smiled again at the perhaps rhetorical question. "...Emotion is what has defined my life. The connections that we form, one person to another. The best and worst things that come with being human. It's...Far easier to explore emotion, and far easier to speak about things you might not otherwise do, when you know the person you are with sincerely cares about it all." She looked at Ellesandra and flashed another smile, then looked back out at the water. "The longer you stay around me, the more I'm sure you'll get used to seeing me be emotional. I...Admit I can get worked up over small things at times. I'm still not perfect at controlling my own emotions, after all," she said with a quiet giggle. "I don't have anything in mind, Ellesandra. We're resting on your insistence, after all. So I'm content to just...Enjoy the sights. Be with you, and be calm for now. I admit I've been thinking about the state of affairs in Cloverport. Wondering if there was maybe some way that we could have returned peace to that place. But before you go chiding me...I know there are things even I can't hope to achieve on my own. And after the stunt we pulled I don't see any diplomatic options for getting rid of the pirates. I can only hope that that works itself out, somehow, I suppose."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't know how to respond to the idea of Star sincerely caring about her, and how she was feeling. It made her a little uncomfortable in that she wasn't sure she wanted someone to get close like that, to actually care for her and poke at things she'd rather leave buried. It seemed Star had agreed not to poke, though, so that was good. "Worked up over small things, like blueberries?" There was a wry tone of amusement in Ellesandra's words and emotions, remembering how Star had teared up and cried a little when Ellesandra had shared her blueberries with her. There wasn't judgment, though. It had been confusion and concern, and now amusement, at how easily Star had teared up over the blueberries. There was no judgment or demeaning attitude towards the fact that Star had shown emotions that easily, though. She spread open the handkerchief in front of her, fingers tracing the embroidered letters, M.K. "I'm not sure what we could have done for the citizens of Cloverport. Honestly, we likely made things worse. That, or they will think we will bring reinforcements and they'll leave. We can hope for that option, but the more likely thing is that they find the dead pirates, both that escorted their supposed elven captive as well as the ones out on the road that attacked you, and they'll take it out on the citizens." She flipped the handkerchief over, idly playing with the thread on it, before lightly folding it up into a neat little triangle. "We could go back and try to do something stealthily, but our options there are limited. Cutting off the head of their group would only bring another captain in their place, and maybe lash out at the village. Burn a ship, that makes it even less likely they leave and they might burn the town. People like that tend to give as good as they get. If you want to help them, then I'd suggest we just share the news of what happened and request the aid of those with enough soldiers to stamp them out in one blow. That way, we don't even have to stop our journey, either." The handkerchief was placed back in her pocket. Out of sight, out of mind; but always carried.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star blushed, but smiled at the mention of blueberries. She giggled. "...Nobody ever really paid much attention to that. And I...What can I say? I appreciate small gestures. You can tell a lot about someone by little thoughtful acts like that," she said, smiling back at the knight while idly kicking her legs. She then listened to the knight speak about the other options, and she paused for a moment, then looked around them. She was getting an idea. Perhaps a dangerous prospect, given her track record. "...I think you're right," she said, looking back at Ellesandra. "I think the elves here will want to know what those pirates did to one of their own. And I think it might be prudent to suggest that they oust those pirates by force, and establish better ties with the governing force in Cloverport. The two settlements are close enough, and the other city being a port means there'd be a lot of opportunity for trade," she said, smiling. "We should see if we can find someone of some authority. Perhaps Morrun would know where to direct us?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star with an eyebrow raised. "You...are a meddler, aren't you?" Like her previous comment about the blueberries, there was no judgment or indication that this was a negative thing. Instead, she was just amused by it, though she did note that this would likely mean a harder job for her in the future, what with making sure Star was safe and all. Sighing, she moved to stand, nodding to what Star was saying. "Then yes, Morrun did offer to introduce us to the leader already didn't he? We can set up a meeting if possible and go from there." She took a moment, stretching her arms up, and then leaning her torso back with her hands on the back of her hips. Stretches in each direction before she cracked her neck and turned back to Star. Her emotions from earlier had all been put back in their spot, feeling much more like herself - well, her current self. She did eye Star's still blotchy face from the sobbing, but didn't comment on it. If Morrun had something to say about it, she would follow Star's lead on it. Star didn't seem the type to hide why she'd cried, but Ellesandra wouldn't volunteer that information if Star didn't first.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star wore a proud, cheery, playful smile upon being called a meddler. A badge of honour, it seemed, rather than something to be ashamed about. "Only where there is evil to be meddled with," she said with a more selfsame chipper, singsong-y cadence to her voice. She rubbed at her eyes, but didn't seem to be too worried about anyone commenting on it. Or if she was, she didn't show it. Off they went, back to Morrun's place. It was growing a bit later in the day. Sunset would be upon them in an hour or two. When they arrived, Lissana showed a bit of concern upon seeing Star. "Oh, Star, Ellesandra. Is everything all right?" asked the elven woman. Star nodded. "Of course, all is well. Just an emotional chat brought on by discussing our next steps," replied Star. Honest, as ever. That seemed to be enough to satisfy the question. Morrun was at the dining table, halfway through eating a muffin. He swallowed and nodded to the two entering. Star began by holding out a hand. The coin pouch that Ellesandra had given her, the one they definitely took their pay out of, appeared in her hand with a subtle glow of light that rose from her palm. As she had said, it was her intent to return it to Morrun, unless Ellesandra stopped her.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along, walking just a pace behind Star and to the side, like most bodyguards would. A single diagonal step needed to cover Star, but giving enough personal distance that Star wouldn't feel crowded - or Ellesandra crowded by Star - and give the illusion to Star, if she wished for it, to forget that Ellesandra was there. When they arrived back to Morrun's place, Lissana's concern wasn't unsurprising. Ellesandra looked much better than Star of course, since she'd only teared up and hadn't let herself actually let go and cry. As they entered and Star went straight to returning the money to Morrun, Ellesandra just gave Morrun a sheepish smile. "Should have waited until we left to give it to her, hmm?" She commented, a minor scold to herself but not actually upset at the turn of events. She'd expected it as soon as Star had mentioned it, though there was a curious gaze given to Star's sleeve. Was there some sort of magical storage in there somewhere? She hadn't seen or felt the bag of coins the entire time they were at the meadows. Still, Ellesandra made no move to stop the return of the coin which she had definitely taken her pay out of. Crossing her arms, she moved to stand by the door to the kitchen, taking up a standard guards spot. This may be Morrun's house and there not be anything to guard against, but it was a comfort thing. She was used to finding a spot where she could see the exits and be close to her charge; not doing so was a sign of Ellesandra truly relaxing, and a level of trust that not even Star had fully earned yet.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun gave Ellesandra a chiding look. A look that said wordlessly that she went and screwed it up, all done with a smile on his lips. "We took our pay out of it, so you can keep the rest," said Star as she set the coins down for the elven man. The heavy thud the bag made had him instinctively knitting his brow. He went to inspect the bag, estimating the coins. He didn't seem pleased. "...What, did each of you take like, two coins?" sighed Morrun. "Honestly. I can't accept this," he said, looking at Star and Ellesandra. "You two barely took anything, as much is obvious," he continued, which now invited Lissana to share in the disapproving stares, threatening as a squirrel with her frown and cute pink apron. Star paused. "...Well, I took five coins. Fifty gold can be made to last a long while. So..." She then turned, slowly, to look at Ellesandra. "...How many did you take, then, Ellesandra?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh, Ellesandra had just fallen into a trap, hadn't she? The slow turn and look from Star made Ellesandra grit her teeth, narrowing her eyes at the mage. Had she planned this? She'd said she could tell when people lied - even implied that she knew Ellesandra hadn't really taken her pay out of the bag earlier. But to set her up for that right in front of Morrun and Lissana was just - well, devious. Ellesandra crossed her arms and held a stoic, nonplussed look on her face as she met Star's gaze. "I paid for my room at the Inn last night, and took ten platinum. And then I decided I would donate ten platinum back to our group fund for our journey, since we'll be sharing time together on the road and supplies and such, anyways." It was a total lie, and ended up to her only taking enough to pay for her room anyways. The thing is, Ellesandra knew Star could tell. And she was meeting Star's gaze in a challenge, the amusement at the situation rising. She wondered how far fetched she could get with her explanations before Star would call her on it in front of people; would she do so now, or would she let it slide? There was a little bit of humor showing, and an interest to see how much she could push Star before she was just straight up called on her bullshit.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Oh, that's a wonderful explanation, if I was a five year old that didn't understand how math works," said Star back with a similar amusement on her voice and posture. "Well in that case, I should explain that I took all of the money, but then donated it to you so you could donate it back to me so I could donate it back to Morrun. If you follow that logic, I think that means both of us got paid twice. Really, Morrun, you have no business being so generous to both of us," she said, briefly turning to the elven man for effect. No, it seemed Star had zero qualms in calling out the lie right then and there. She sighed. She could recognize that she hadn't taken all the money herself either. "Honestly. When we were first walking to Cloverport you talked about me hiring you. If I knew hiring your services cost a grand total of what...One gold per day, I could have hired you for a few months on that salary without issue. But I think we can all agree a knight's escort is worth at least a little more than that, can't we?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star took the excuse further and it got an honest, surprised laugh out of Ellesandra. She tilted her head back out belted out an amused chuckle, one she hadn't really made in so long she herself was surprised that it had come out. She cleared her throat, taking on the stoic look again, but this time looking to Morrun. "Did you hear that? You're quite generous, paying us twice." And then she looked back to Star. She tightened her arms around her own chest in her crossed arms position, shaking her head at her. "I'm sorry, you seem to be under the impression that the client gets to decide what the cost of my services is. No, my services are valued by myself. And I will sell my services for what I think is appropriate, which may change from one job to another." Her eyebrows raised, challenging Star to disagree. "Or do you not think that I am fully capable of recognizing the worth of my work? And what is appropriate to charge? I have been doing this job for three years, after all, and even longer beforehand in a longterm contract. I like to think I know what I'm worth." She knew she was lowkey arguing that her worth was less than Star was implying, but she also knew that it was up to her to charge what she wanted, not up to Star to decide what she should be paid. And she'd draw that boundary clearly. "If you can't afford me, well. Then I guess that's your loss." She said, feeling amusement at the mock bickering they had right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun and Lissana exchanged glances. The more these two observed Star and Ellesandra, the less they understood them. Not sleeping in the same bed, not even the same house, but... "They argue just like we do, dear," said Morrun to his wife, evoking a giggle. Star seemed to miss this comment as she fired back at Ellesandra. "Yeah? Well it might just be the clearest evidence I have no business being a pirate, because I sure do know when I'm stealing something!" she said, hands on her hips and a smile on her face as she leaned slightly towards the knight. "So be honest then, gallant knight! Let's negotiate a price, right here, right now! I anticipate the journey I'm undertaking will take upwards of a year. So I'm sure within that time frame I will have secured enough gold to purchase your services for a year thereafter at an agreed-upon price. So this is my formal proposition to hire you for a full year. Go on, name your price!" As she said this, she swiped the bag of platinum from the table again, ready to use this as a chance to back Ellesandra into a corner on the bargaining table. There was quite a lot of gold in the coinage of platinum for her to work with, and how she was planning to out-fox the knight wasn't quite clear, but it was their move.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced at Morrun curiously at his comment, not quite sure what he was implying there. Her and Star certainly weren't a couple, so it couldn't be that. Shrugging, she looked back at Star and her smile, as well as the challenge she was giving her. Ellesandra didn't name her price, not at first. At first, her eyes scanned Star up and down, trying to determine how serious she was about this. She didn't want Star to feel like she was making her out to be a thief, even though that would be wholly inaccurate and completely within Ellesandra's rights to offer her services for free. Leaning back against the wall, she raised an eyebrow at the woman, then looked to the bag. "Oh, I don't know. I'm thinking for a full year of my service, paid upfront, would be about....440 gold." That would be what was left in there, if Star really took 5 platinum and Ellesandra had taken 1 platinum to pay for her Inn room with. The exact amount, if Ellesandra's calculations were correct. "Considering you are getting the services of a trained Knight, that equals to just over 1 gold a day, doesn't it?" Math was not Ellesandra's specialty and she didn't even try to pretend to do the actual calculation for what it was worth. "If you would rather, you can pay half up front and keep the other half with you in case you need it on your journey. When you earn more you can pay it at the end of the journey." Okay, now Ellesandra was just being snobby, teasing Star into considering keeping the bag of coin herself.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star's reaction was instant. The moment Ellesandra said 440 gold, Star placed the entire bag into Ellesandra's hands, by first gently grabbing their wrist if necessary. There was still the nine gold in change Ellesandra had received that was also in the bag, but Star felt the dramatic act would be subdued if she fished around to grab those coins first. "There. Consider yourself hired, then," she said, arms folded. And through it all, Morrun was just chuckling to himself at the absurdity of this whole ordeal. The gold was right back where it started when he handed it to Ellesandra.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had expected something of that sort, taking the bag and bouncing it in her hand once, as if gauging how much was it in. She even put on the act of opening it and pilfering few some of the coins to better estimate and ensure that they were all platinum, like someone seeing a bag of coin for the first time. "Ah, lovely, perfect, thank you Miss Lumina." A grin was flashed towards Star. "Now, as someone who is invested in this journey we're on, I would like to donate to our group fund, so to speak. This can be used to purchase supplies, buy nights of lodging and pay for any travel costs during our year. Typically this would be entirely at the expense of the client, but again - I am particularly partial to completing this mission and wish to help." She then hefted the bag, weighing it again as if considering how much was in it and how much to give. "So...yes, I think this would do it." Stepping forward, she would take Star's wrist and turn it over, facing up. Her guards were up, expecting the touch, but it was only brief enough to place the bag of coins in Star's upturned palm. "Yes, I think that will do." If Star still resisted, she would just take the bag of coin and set it atop Star's head, before turning to Morrun. "So, we did come here for a purpose, Sir. I believe Star here wished to seek an audience with the leader of this settlement? Something about convincing him to help the town of Cloverport out, set up an allying agreement or something or another. I'm sure my client is better with words than I am, she is the meddler after all." Ellesandra was sporting a smirk the entire time she spoke.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was immediately ready to counter what she saw coming. Back to this talk of donating, as soon as it came, had Star pouting and putting her hands behind her back, folded over the small of her back and out of reach. The grin she wore said she felt she outfoxed her knightly opponent. But then they just put it on her head. "Wh-- Hey!" she said, doing a good job of balancing the coins on her head. Ellesandra then moving on without giving her a chance to counter seemed to seal the matter. She grumbled, taking the coins off her head as she leered at Ellesandra. Morrun quirked a brow at the knight. "Oh, did you? Here I thought you just saw fit to regale my wife and I in impromptu theatre," he said with a cheeky grin on his face. Lissana had a sweet look on her face while leaning against the wall that connected the dining area and the kitchen. Star, still clearly pouty about being bested at her own game, took a more serious tone when talking to Morrun. "...Yes. The nearby city of Cloverport is overrun with pirates. I mean, obviously. You know that as well as I do. It was my thinking that passing on the news of what happened to you to those in charge of this settlement will be the best course of action. First, because if they have done this once, they are sure to do it again. And as beautiful as this place is, Ellesandra and I aren't long to stay. So a return here after I have achieved my goal to see you both again aside, we won't be here to save any other innocent people here who might be targeted. As necessary as it was to do what we did, it's likely that whether we paid or attacked, the pirates would have felt either emboldened to get away with it again, or in this case, out for revenge. And the people here should not need to feel like they are being hunted. So, much as I detest violence...It's my suggestion that your settlement's hunters take action. Perhaps in a joint effort with the local militia of Cloverport. If the pirate influence is removed, then there will be safe passage, trade, and all the benefits of local cooperation." Star smiled. Morrun considered the words. "Well. You certainly make a diplomatic case for it, Star. But the decision's not up to me on that. I'd also rather not force Lissana to relive any of it, so I'd best speak on her behalf." He paused to smile at his wife, assuring them that he would handle things. Lissana had a small nervousness, a tremor in her figure that spoke of the trauma she would eventually have to deal with. Star clearly noticed, for she was giving Lissana that familiar stare, and it brought sorrow to Star's face. Morrun stood, moving over to the other two after giving his wife a kiss. "I'll see about getting you an audience."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She felt a pride and satisfaction fill her when Star pouted and seemed to relent about the coin. Oh, it was entirely possible that Star snuck the coin back somehow later, or just used it to purchase something for Ellesandra or something like that, but really what could she do about that? No, the gold had been given to Star, and it was hers to do with now. The theatre comment caused more amusement as she glanced at Lissana, then back to Morrun as he spoke with Star. Her mood quickly shifted to one of concern when Lissana was brought back up, and the trauma that happened to her. Ellesandra only glanced at her once before looking back to Morrun, not wanting her to feel like she was being stared or watched, or pitied by everyone in the room. At Morrun's confirmation about getting them an audience, she once more spoke up while looking to Star. "Well, while you do that, I believe by how dark it is beginning to get it should be time for some dinner. Lissana, would you like any help in the kitchen?" Ellesandra was not a great cook by any means, but she knew how to do the basic things at least. You didn't live alone travelling along the road without learning how to do camp cooking, and it could only be easier when doing it in an actual kitchen, right? Not to mention, the entire point of the offer was to get Lissana's mind off of the trauma she'd just been reminded of and give her the option of company, if she'd like it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star and Morrun looked at each briefly. Star smiled. "I'm famished," she said aloud in encouragement to Ellesandra. But there was something subtle to it. It was intentional. Star wasn't one to impose on others, so for her to make such a comment could only be to reinforce a sense of purpose in Lissana, who brightened at the thought of Ellesandra helping, and having something to focus on. "O-Oh, uhm, if you don't mind, Miss Ellesandra," she said, her more meek side appearing as the emotions took hold of her. Lissana had a bright side to her, but she seemed quite susceptible to the fear and discomfort of the memories. She still had fading red marks on her wrists and lips, as well as ankles, which weren't visible before given the woman was wearing long pants, but with her airy summer dress they certainly were. Manacles on wrists and ankles left their marks. "We'll leave dinner to you both then. Be back soon, my love," said Morrun, then existed with Star. Curiously, the coin bag was gone again, nowhere on Star's person. Where had it gone this time? She didn't have sleeves on her dress to slide it up, nor pockets to hide it in. But this wouldn't be something one could focus on long, for the two were out the door soon after.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There had been a brief pang of regret when she'd realized Star was going off to the meeting. Ellesandra had thought Morrun was off to set up a meeting, not that the meeting was happening now. Not that Ellesandra cared at all about the meeting itself, but just a matter of not being there in case the leader responded poorly for some reason. She glanced back, watching Star exit and silently hoping she hadn't just put Star in danger by trying to get Lissana's mind off of things. She didn't dwell on it for long, though, before turning to follow Lissana into the kitchen, not having even noticed the disappearance of the coin bag. "No Miss necessary, just Ellesandra is fine." She said, responding to Lissana a bit belatedly. She was being gentle, and would stand to the side, waiting for Lissana to guide her. This wasn't her kitchen, nor did she know what they were going to be making, so she stood at the ready. "What can I help with? I certainly don't want to get in your way with my help, so feel free to tell me where to go and what to do." Someone who had been chained up being able to tell others what to do, not just be told what to do, would be helpful right? Ellesandra wasn't sure how to approach this, but she was going off of gut feeling right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana gave a sheepish nod. She didn't wish to address a knight improperly, less so one that was dually responsible for saving her life. Lissana didn't know what Ellesandra was familiar with doing in the kitchen, but she did assume the others would be out for an hour or more. The notion that they were hungry had Lissana eager to make a bigger meal, so she invited Ellesandra down into the basement of the home. Therein, a cold storage room was set up with small blue mana crystals that kept the room icy cold. Frozen meats kept in storage was something of a higher class amenity, but if nothing else it did suggest that the two of them were capable of parting with five hundred gold somewhat painlessly. It was a lot, but they clearly weren't lacking. They were comfortable. A whole chicken was going to be used as part of it, which Lissana had Ellesandra carry while she grabbed some vegetables, spices, and herbs from her pantry. A couple more things were added to the knight's hold, though Lissana would have to grab it; she shelving was built with elves in mind. And elves were regularly well above six feet tall, so the knight would find much of the higher shelves out of reach without some assistance. All said and done, the two moved back up and Lissana got to focusing on dolling out the tasks. If Ellesandra was familiar with how to butcher a chicken, that would be their job once the plucked chicken carcass had been out long enough to thaw, which curiously only took about ten minutes. Curious magic at work, but quite the convenience. Most of the work was done on a cutting board with the veggies, which were being used both to add substance to the meal as well as to cook with the chicken to impart their flavours. The chicken needed to be sectioned into quarters, and Lissana described the ultimate goal as an aromatic dish that used spice and earthy vegetables on top of an herby rub on the chicken to give it all a wonderful flavour. Potatoes would round out the plate of chicken and veg, with a wholesome chicken-shallot gravy for the whole or part of the meal. An anecdote was thrown in: apparently Morrun liked gravy on everything, jokingly explained as the man bathing his food in it. He had seemed a bit generous with the syrup at breakfast, so it was not a major surprise. But of course, the way Lissana spoke of her husband would come as no surprise in how loving it was. How after however long they were married, she still was as in love with him now as the day they met. But with the focus on the task, Lissana wouldn't stray too far from small talk unless Ellesandra had specific questions.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a good worker. She followed along with Lissana and helped her carry things, doing what she asked. A strange glance was given to the small blue mana crystals, but she didn't comment on them. Her eyes stared up at the tall cabinets far above her head, and was glad that Lissana was getting things out of them instead of her. Once back up in the kitchen, she followed Lissana's instructions. The small talk was all she needed or offered, since unlike Star she had no idea how to help ease the tension that Lissana was probably feeling in regards to the recent trauma she'd had. Ellesandra had offered her company and something to do to distract the elf, and that was about all she knew to offer in a situation like this. The food sounded delicious, and smelled delicious as she was helping prepare it. She was happy to handle the chicken and prepare it, and then begin slicing and chopping vegetables and such, but she left most of the actual cooking to Lissana. Ellesandra knew just enough not to burn the house down and to be able to survive on her own; she wasn't about to step in on Lissana and mess anything up. As Lissana began talking more and more about Morrun, Ellesandra found that would probably be a relatively safe topic to delve into. Asking how they met, who proposed to who and how that went, and all those typical questions she'd learned the kitchen and serving staff would gossip about growing up. Ellesandra had never really partaken in said gossip and girlish questions, but it didn't mean she hadn't been around enough to listen in and hear the types of things that were asked. Beyond that, Ellesandra was quiet and let Lissana talk, or let a comfortable silence build between them.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The story that Lissana had to tell on the matter was a simple but cute one. Morrun was a planar scholar, Lissana a teacher of the Seldarine teachings. The inn bore the same name in part - 'Seldarine'. She went on to explain it was the elvish pantheon, though she didn't get into technical details. But it had sparked a connection, with the two meeting in a library and discussing a place known as the Feywild for so long that the library had to inform the two of them mid-conversation that they were closing for the day, and on that night the two walked among the stars and simply explored the connection they felt. It led to a swift romance borne of a shared scholarly interest, and of course helped by the fact that the two found one another so very beautiful. Morrun proposed to Lissana quite quickly by elvish standards - it was only twenty years later! Which, if that brought with it any confusion would lead to Lissana speaking to how Morrun was two-hundred and seven years old, and Lissana was one-hundred and eighty five. Still quite young, by elvish timelines. Lissana then took a break from cooking while there was less to do and jaunted up the stairs to come back down with an oil painting that had been made of them on their wedding day, showing Morrun in a stylish dark-green set of his finest clothes, with Lissana in a brilliant emerald-green dress. The painting was well done. Not a masterwork, but a competent painter certainly was wielding the brush. Of course, it would have taken more than a day to create such a thing, so the two likely dressed up more than a few times to get this done. A beautiful memento, all the same. She returned it to their bedroom once she had shown it off thoroughly, then returned to finish cooking. Between the story and the cooking, it did seem to have Lissana in higher spirits. A bandage for the pain for the day, even if it was still going to be a long road ahead for Lissana. Nightmares were sure to come, but that Lissana was saved allowed them to take on a semblance of normalcy that would certainly see them healing in time. They had safety and a loving husband. They would be okay. Time passed, and while the food cooked, Lissana saw fit to prepare a dessert as well. A pie, she settled on, but there was some indecision about what filling to use. She would take Ellesandra's input if they had any, but if not she would make an apple pie for no particular reason other than having a bit of a surplus of apples. Morrun and Star were taking a bit longer than one might expect, but surely they would return soon.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was patient in listening to the story, offering a smile in the right spots and nods and attentively listening to the elven woman. The painting surprised her, eyes raising in surprise at the idea of them having gotten that painted and how much effort that must have taken. They certainly were well off then, between the mana crystals and being able to afford such a painting. Eventually, Ellesandra had just stopped working, letting Lissana take over the activities and more just keeping her company in the kitchen, in order to prevent them from running out of things to do to keep Lissana busy. When the topic of pie was brought up and the option of what to use for it, Ellesandra recommended blueberries if they had any left from breakfast. She didn't elaborate on why, though Lissana had been at breakfast that morning and had clearly seen Star get teary eyed about the knight sharing her blueberries. She'd glanced out the window occasionally, as time passed getting a little worried that something might have gone wrong with this meeting. Surely if it had been a quick meeting they would have been back by now, right? Then again, it was entirely possible they just had to wait for a while to be able to even meet with the leader of the camp, if the person was busy with other things. Or even Star being her meddlesome self and actively helping plan. A soft smile crossed her lips in amusement at the thought of Star bent over a war table with a map of Cloverport on it, pointing out where the ships were and everything else she remembered about the pirates. Maybe not actively suggesting battle tactics - that didn't seem up Star's alley - but providing as much information as possible definitely did. Moving to lean back against the wall again, she'd look towards Lissana and change the topic so it didn't get stale. "So Seldarine is an Elven deity? Is there anything I should know about them? I apologize, I'm not particularly versed in deities beyond those I grew up with. The land I grew up with mostly served Tyr, though I was particular to Torm in my youth. Knighthood and all, tended to be dedicated to loyalty and honor." Less personal, hopefully, but also a topic most people found uplifting. Ellesandra may have long lost her faith in deities being righteous or good as they might proclaim to be, but she knew that religion was important to a lot of people in time of hardship.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Hm? Oh, it's not a single deity. It's in reference to one of the two elvish pantheons. Without bridging into the entire history, Seldarine is elvish for 'fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood'. The Seldarine follow Corellon and his consort, Angharradh, among the other lesser deities below. There's much you could learn, but as for what you should know, it is simply that long, long, long ago, Corellon and Lolth were once lovers, but Lolth, called Araushnee at the time, allied herself with Gruumsh to try and kill Corellon. Araushnee was exiled by Corellon, where she took the name Lolth, and with a whole lifetime's worth of reading in the history being skipped, it is now that the Seldarine and Lolth-sworn oppose one another. You will find no drow among our ranks, even if there are some among the drow who do good." She then giggled. "You'll have to forgive me as I acknowledge that you are...Quite exactly the sort of follower of Torm that I envision. Protective, lawful, duty-bound, righteous...I shall have to offer him my thanks in prayer, and perhaps see if there is a temple in his name near us for me to make a donation to. He might certainly have had a hand in bringing you to me in my hour of need; even if he had not, he has guided you to become the sort of person who would do as you had." A smile was given. Of course, Lissana didn't know the particulars of whose idea it was, only that Ellesandra had played a major role in her salvation. She explained all this while working on the filling for what was to be a blueberry pie. If she had any inclination what the recommendation was for, she didn't say anything. But it was after this lecture that revealed Lissana to be quite the religious sort that Star and Morrun returned, walking into the home with calm smiles about them. Though Star had a look about her as she met eyes with Ellesandra. A look of slight nervousness. A look that suggested she might have news that Ellesandra might not like.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't commented on how she was the exact type of follow of Torm that Lissana would expect. She just silently nodded, knowing that if she disagreed about Torm having anything to do with her rescue it might sound insulting to someone who was so obviously strongly religious. She was also saved from having to find any other topics to discuss by the return of Star and Morrun. Ellesandra quickly looked Star up and down to ensure nothing had happened to her while she was away, the concern that she'd had quickly turning to relief, then confusion and concern again when she met eyes with Star. Then dread and acceptance. She sighed, running a hand through her hair before pulling it up into a ponytail again, just so it would be out of the way when it came to whatever she had just been volunteered to do, or for dinner. "I take it we're joining the return trip to Cloverport? Or is that look for some other reason?" She eyed Star, taking a wild guess at what that nervousness might be for. Star was a meddler, and she'd thought that maybe Star had just been helping plan. But maybe Star had actively volunteered their assistance; it was the most likely option, Ellesandra thought. Of course it was also possible that Star had somehow insulted the elven leader and they were being kicked out, but that seemed more like something she would do, not Star. A glance was given over to the food cooked, and then a polite nod offered to Morrun, before looking back to Star to wait for the news that she was probably not going to like.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Oh, good. You already heard," said Star with a nervous smile that silently said 'don't kill me please'. "...Though technically it's only my own services that were required to convince the council. A compelling argument was made that I had no business requesting others risk their life if I was not willing to do the same; there was quite the disagreement between two of the council members, one stating that the elves were safe here and that the solution was for nobody to be leaving without escort, the other saying that it was cowardly to hide in this place waiting to be discovered...It grew a little heated for a moment," explained Star, though she kept a chipper tone. "All is well though. And as much as I can insist that you yourself aren't required to join along, Ellesandra, I know how futile that line of discussion is so...We move at dawn. For what it's worth though, I only am acting as a healer, behind any frontline we establish. The wounded will be brought back so I can help minimize injury or loss of life. I'm more of a liability in a full scale fight like this anyway. As you saw I can protect myself but...Not for a protracted fight." Morrun said nothing, just moved to his wife. Lissana looked initially concerned, but hearing that Star wouldn't be on the front did ease her worried looks a touch. "The plan is to make contact with the local lord. Then, in tandem with the local militia, the force ought to be so overwhelming as to force a retreat. And when the pirates run back to their ships to set sail, the coastal ballistae will sink them." A sound plan in theory...But it had yet to touch upon the matter of how the pirates got in in the first place, with such defenses at the ready. By chance, perhaps? Stealth? The jolly roger handn't been flown on any ships after all. But surely the port city had guardsman enough to fight back? There remained pieces that might not be known, and could either be nothing at all, or details that could turn a bloodless confrontation into choas in moments.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at the 'already heard' part. She hadn't, she had just guarded a meddler before. Star was way too similar to Marigold. It gave Ellesandra the exact exasperation she'd felt before, and that was both a pleasant thing to feel again as well as painful, remembering the last thing Marigold had meddled in and how that had turned out. She rubbed her face with her hand, exasperation and stress obvious even without Star's ability to see it, but what Star would be able to see - beneath everything - was an ounce of pride in her for not just backing down. "Fine, back lines is good. I'll accompany and guard to ensure that they don't flank you or send someone in as a spy but is actually injured or anything." Ellesandra's actual talents would be better on the front lines, but she was not leaving Star. And she was not bringing Star with her to the front lines, so rear guard it would be." A deep breath was taken, then she looked over to Lissana and Morrun. "Good thing we'll be filling up on food tonight. Should get plenty of rest before setting off tomorrow." Ellesandra hoped the attack and retaking of the city would be as easy as Star had just laid it out. She highly doubted it would, though. She didn't know how the pirates had taken the place over, but it was likely they had inside men. If the elves were contacting the local lord, it was very possible they could be walking into a trap. There wasn't exactly fear, in regards to this, but caution and concern for Star in this whole process. Damned pure hearted women not knowing when to refuse a risk. "Any other news that I should know in regards to your meeting tonight, or the new mission tomorrow?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star of course knew that Ellesandra didn't hear about the plans ahead of time. How could they? Only Star and Morrun knew; the rest of the hunters would convene through the night, go through their reverie, and be ready by dawn. Star and Ellesandra had the disadvantage of needing twice as much rest as everyone else in this settlement, so they would need to sleep sooner rather than later. Star nodded to the notion of Ellesandra staying on the backlines. There was a bit of relief in her own face. Not that she believed the pirates could best Ellesandra in battle, but she didn't want to invite the knight to injury either. She shook her head to the question of other news. "That's about it. We all agree the threat to the region is too great to ignore. I will simply need to meditate tonight before bed, so I will need time alone after, and after tending to your wounds." Of course Star wouldn't forget about that part. "My meditation will ensure I am in top shape for tomorrow, so you can rest easy tonight, Ellesandra. We'll meet here at dawn tomorrow, then join the rear guard at the gates." With all that squared away, if there was no other business, it became time to eat.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. "No need to heal me. I'll be fine, and I'd rather you be up to absolute full strength tomorrow if you're going to be healing those who are injured. My guess is you'll have a lot more work to be doing tomorrow than I will." If things went to plan, that was. Rear guard only saw action if things didn't go according to plan. Otherwise, she was probably going to be just a bell girl, running to and fro getting supplies and helping carry injured people in or something. She'd done that role before while in rear guard; it wasn't like she was just going to be standing around, but the difference between doing any small task Star would need of her versus actively healing injuries was pretty major. As it came time to food, Ellesandra would help Lissana bring it all out to the table, and then move to take the same seat she had before. A polite nod was given to Lissana in thanks for the food, overall, and she eyed the chicken with more interest than she had the pancakes and sausage this morning. She didn't just delve into it, though. She would wait and be polite, letting everyone else grab at their food first. She'd talked quite a bit with Lissana earlier, so unless she was directly spoken to she was quiet, letting her introversion recharge, but she was attentive to the conversation nonetheless, glancing back and forth during any small talk over dinner to follow who was talking and what they were saying. She seemed relatively at peace, still having some concern for Star but mostly just relaxed - probably some of the most relaxed Star had seen from Ellesandra yet.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"We'll be in combat tomorrow. I'm healing you tonight," said Star with a stern tone. That wasn't negotiable it seemed, and Star didn't seem keen on hearing otherwise. So unless Ellesandra was keen on squabbling some more in front of the married couple, dinner began and the relaxed atmosphere was pleasant. Star didn't seem interested much at all in the chicken. A small piece for her. Lissana took a leg, and Morrun a breast, leaving a good amount left for Ellesandra. Star seemed to prefer eating fruits and veggies. Not a strict vegetarian by any measure, but she clearly had her preference if these meals had been any indication. It also likely mattered whether there was a choice in the matter or not; living on the wilderness, small game and protein was a necessary food, so even if Star's diet had its preferences, necessity would always trump them in all likelihood. Small talk was all that amounted from the table. Lissana spoke of showing off the wedding portrait, and of course Star insisted on seeing it, so it was brought down again for Star to see after the meal. Plenty of food for all it seemed, leaving Ellesandra a solid half of the chicken to themselves. A good, filling meal; the elven herbs and spices gave the meal a subtle, earthy flavour that was wholesome and left one's gullet feeling pleasantly plump with a lingering, herby aftertaste that set them all up quite well for dessert. Lissana was no gourmet chef, but it was the sort of staple meal that would never get old on the palette. And as predicted, Morrun's plate was in some places more gravy than it was food. Hard to blame him, as the gravy added even more delight to an already pleasant dish. After some enjoyable small talk, Lissana and Morrun talking about how they met for Star, dessert came. Star gave a playful side-eye to her knightly companion, but it was with a warm smile. No tears this time, thankfully, but Star was clearly in heaven with the dessert. A fresh pie was a perfect finish to the evening. But before Ellesandra could walk away from it all, Star would be sure to get in their way and gesture into the guest room for a bit of privacy so she could heal them. Not that flashing a bit of thigh was all that risque, but better to not force the knight to stand in a position with Star on her knees in front of them for the married couple to joke about.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't fight the comment. She was afraid Star wouldn't understand how much energy it would take to heal her, but she also knew that it wasn't worth having an argument over right now. Instead she fully delved into the chicken. The only kind of meat she liked more than chicken had been salmon, though she had only had that once or twice, and could you really call fish, meat? Either way, she ate plenty, careful not to over eat so that she wouldn't be too tired tonight and thus in the morning, but more than enough to sate herself. Unlike Morrun, she used very little of the gravy, only enough to add a bit of a wetness to the meat and help swallow it down, letting the taste of the chicken itself be the main event on her plate. She also ignored the side eye she got from Star when it came to the dessert, and only ate a very small piece of it. This wasn't to save some for Star, and more that she normally wasn't one for super sweet foods. Savory and salty were her preferences, and pies tended not to be like that. So she ate enough to be polite, especially since she'd been the one to recommend blueberries, but that was about it. As the food was finished entirely and Star insisted again on healing her, she sighed and moved to stand up. "Yes, my lady." The teasing and mocking tone at how Star was ordering her was apparent. There was no malice behind it, just her poking fun at how Star had gone from being a polite companion who 'hired' Ellesandra to now ordering her to get healed. She would walk off towards the guest room, leaving the door open as she stepped in. Not wearing her armor or leggings, she had no real choice but to just drop her breeches down to her knees. She also didn't know what position would be best for Star to do this, so she lowered them to her knees and stood with her legs wide enough apart to prevent them from falling all the way down. Ellesandra wore basic white undergarments, absolutely nothing special and designed entirely for function, not for anything else. Her thighs looked relatively smooth, minus a stray hair here and there since she hadn't exactly been keeping up on keeping them smoothly shaven, and of course the bandages that were still wrapped around where the wound itself was on both thighs. It had fully scabbed over and was healing decently, though was obviously a bit red in irritation at her continued movements and how much weight she'd put on them the previous day while carrying Star.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a playful smile at Ellesandra at the mocking tone. Their little jabs back and forth were in good fun, and the mystic woman clearly understood and was happy to play along. It allowed a more casual closeness between them, rather than a stiff one between hired hand and patron. Even if that was technically the case, the way Star treated it was anything but; she would be just as insistent on this even if she hadn't hired Ellesandra, and had no intentions now or ever to use that agreement against the knight. Star did have a bit of a blush as the knight dropped their pants. Rather unavoidable, but with them standing like this to allow Star at their wounds, it was a rather...Awkward position as Star got down on her knees and moved her hands to the knight's thighs. Gentle hands removed the bandages and examined the wounds. She smiled, seeing they were healing nicely. But she wasn't about to leave them as they were. Her fingers moved onto the wounds themselves, pressing the pads of her four primary fingers vaguely equidistant from one another across the length of the cuts. Then, a gentle flow of something that was...Magical, yes, but it did not feel the same as any other times others had healed Ellesandra. First there was a small tingle of magic, something that touched against the resistance Ellesandra had like a wave upon a wall of rocks. Then...A flowing sensation through that resistance. Not pierced, but...Bypassed all the same, as if whatever Star was doing didn't fit the same mold of what Ellesandra's innate resilience was accustomed to. It looked effortless to Star, but then again so did her radiant, rainbow armor. And both of them saw how that went. But after this sensation came the soothing. The pain melted away. The irritation ebbed. The skin glowed under her touch, and the wounds vanished in a blink. The rash, the scabs, were no more. Star looked at the results, then smiled and rose to her feet again, keeping eyes above the waist to allow the knight to get their modesty back. "There. Wasn't so bad, was it?" she said, warmly smiling. "And look, I'm not doubled over heaving. I promise...I'll be more than ready for whatever tomorrow brings. I won't be acting alone, so the burden of healing will be spread among the group of healers." Star certainly seemed to be fine moving on like nothing happened, but...There was no ignoring that whatever she did, nothing about it should have played out as it had with the way Ellesandra's resistances were. It defied explanation. Was Star just...Special like that? Or was something else going on? The wounds were healed, that was certain. But...How? Did Star just expend a mountain of energy to do it? She certainly didn't seem fatigued...But maybe she was hiding it, and waiting for Ellesandra to leave before doubling over in exhaustion?

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She felt the awkwardness, and turned her gaze up so that she wasn't looking down at Star while she was doing her work at all. Her muscled thighs tensed and flexed at the feel of Star's hands on them, even just removing the bandages, and when she felt Star begin to use magic, Ellesandra had actively prepared herself to allow magic in. Naturally, magic seemed to roll off of her if it was directly targeted at her. Generic, area spells didn't exactly roll off of her, but tended to have less severe of an effect. Healing magic was a direct target, and between the magic usually rolling off and Ellesandra's body also wanting to naturally absorb the mana and energy within the spell, she had to actively focus on NOT doing that. She couldn't stop her natural resistance, but she could stop her body from trying to just suck in the mana. It was an important skill she'd learned when she'd first discovered her abilities, found after absorbing too much magic unintentionally and causing a severe mana sickness in herself. The healing didn't go as she expected. Oh, she still had to prevent herself from drawing in some of Star's mana and energy with the healing, but her natural resistance seemed to just...not exist. She looked down, over her shoulder at where the wounds were when Star stood up, frowning at how simple it had been. Star didn't LOOK fatigued or as if she had tried to just power through a strong barrier. The confusion was evident, even as Ellesandra reached down and pulled her breeches back up, re tightening them around her waist. Her eyes never left Star with a frown on her face, turning to her and crossing her arms. "Either you're hiding how much energy you just put into that or there is something you're not telling me, Star." Neither option was good, honestly. The former was bad for her role tomorrow, the latter was bad for her knowing what to expect. "I have never been healed as easily as that, not without a healer expending an enormous amount of energy to do so. I have scars all over my arms and torso for that reason. Why were you different just now?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a knowing look on Star's face. There was no doubt she knew that this was wrong somehow for the knight. But for a moment she collected her thoughts, considering how she might make this out such that Ellesandra didn't chide her. Or chide her...As much. Star folded her hands behind her back, looking somewhat like a kid with their hand caught in the cookie jar. "Well. I know regular healing spells, of course. But I felt the resistance on you, and that wouldn't have worked very well. Much as you might not believe me, I do think about how to properly expend my mana so that I can do all that I need to do, as well. I know I'll need my reserves for tomorrow. So brute forcing past your resistance wasn't a smart idea. So instead I used..." She paused, pursing her lips. "...Another method. Something unique to me. My mother called it 'sympathetic healing'. It'll probably be how I have to heal you each time I do. But look!" she said, throwing her arms up in the air with a smile. "I'm fine! No need to fuss!" Her reaction was a little...Forcibly chipper. Trying to keep Ellesandra from asking too many more questions, perhaps? After all, Star did swear not to lie to them, so it was likely if there was more to it, any further questioning would ensure Star spill the beans so as to not be lying by omission. Still. The hope was there that her given, surface explanation was enough. It probably wouldn't be. But she could hope.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was suspicious. Star seemed to be too chipper about healing her. Her lips pressed into a thin line and her eyes narrowed, watching Star for a moment. There was definitely something going on there, but Star was obviously avoiding talking about it. She looked her up and down once, checking to see any signs of fatigue as if she had, indeed, brute forced the healing. Seeing nothing, she grumbled. "Well, isn't that convenient?" She muttered to herself. Finding the one person who could apparently heal her without any injuries and being hired by her. Shaking her head, she turned to head for the door. "Get some rest then, Star. Whatever it is you did, I'm sure you need to recover from it." It sounded like an order, though Ellesandra wasn't exactly going to be around for it. She looked back over her shoulder at Star, eyeing her up and down again. The suspicion was there; she knew Star was hiding something, she just didn't know what it was. And like the night before, she was not going to be sleeping here with her but at the Inn. "Do you need anything before I go?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked a little surprised that Ellesandra left it at that. But it was fine. She smiled, and shook her head. "I'm quite all right. I'll be in meditation for a while, so please pass on my goodnights to Morrun and Lissana and ask them to keep the door closed, as I will need peace for it. It will ensure I am, as promised, in tip top shape for tomorrow. We'll see peace brought back to this region by sundown, Ellesandra." She smiled again. "Sleep well. I'll see you at dawn." And if that was that, she saw fit to set up on the bed and begin her meditation, trusting Ellesandra to close the door behind them before going to the inn. Presumably, Ellesandra had some coin of their own for the inn, as Star had been 'donated' back the large sum given by Morrun.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched Star for a moment longer. She let the pause extend even after Star reassured her, and wished her a good night. A moment for Star to open up about whatever magic that was. She flexed her thighs, feeling the fully healed skin and that it didn't hurt at all anymore. When nothing came, she just nodded. "Sleep well." The door was shut behind her and she headed off into the main room, smiling to Lissana and Morrun. "She'll be meditating and then heading to sleep to prep for tomorrow, so please don't disturb her unless necessary. Lissana, before I head back to the Inn to do the same myself, would you like any assistance with cleaning dinner up?" They had, after all, just went straight back to Star's room right after dinner. It was only in hindsight that Ellesandra had realized how potentially rude that had been, and was entirely prepared to help clean up or do whatever dish washing would be needed before going to the inn for another night's rest. When she returned bright and early in the morning, she'd be fully armored again and prepared for battle, warrior's ponytail and all.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The lingering moment on Star eroded her. That something was left unsaid, that Ellesandra knew it...Star could not allow it to go without being said. She had thought she wanted it, because it would keep Ellesandra from being upset. If Ellesandra had just left promptly, it would have happened differently. But Star could not accept feeling like she had lied to Ellesandra. So... "...I took your pain," she said just as Ellesandra turned. She then turned and lifted the skirt of her dress to show the location where the wounds had been on Ellesandra. There was no wound to be seen, but there was a slowly fading mark on her skin, a magical line that copied the shape of Ellesandra's wound. Admiring Star's shapely legs and smooth, feminine thighs would have to wait for another time that she wasn't exposing them for a purpose that would likely anger Ellesandra to some measure. "The wound does pass to me initially. But it heals. I am not damaged by this. My body does not suffer broken skin nor bloodloss. It is taken unto my aura instead." She looked at Ellesandra sternly, then. "I need you to hear me when I tell you I am not harmed by this act. I take on the agony of the wound...And it does take from my magical strength." She lowered her skirt again, turning to face Ellesandra once more. "But the mightiest strength of auramancy, of my magic, is known as purity of self. Disease, afflictions, wounds...So long as my aura remains strong, these melt off of me. I have no scars on my body, despite being wounded many times. Of course I can still suffer mortal blows, hence my ability to harden my aura to an impenetrable armor, as it is better to be exhausted than dead. So before you chide me...It is my purpose and desire to take the burdens of others. I know my limits. I will not use this power recklessly or foolishly. But had I been there to heal you when your arm was damaged, I would have saved you from the lingering injury, and would not have suffered it myself beyond however many hours or days of pain I would endure as my aura cleansed me of its influence." She sighed. "...I might still be able to undo what was done, with time. But for now, I simply...Needed to know that I could heal you, if it came to it. If it comes a time where it is martial prowess we require, and you have been critically wounded...Our best chance will be for me to endure the agony instead, and allow you to fight on. So before you think me foolishly taking a wound of yours that I know you're more than capable of enduring yourself...Understand that my mind thinks days, weeks, months ahead of now in this moment." Clearly, with all that she had to say on the matter, she was very much anticipating that Ellesandra would be none too pleased about this revelation of what Star would need to do to heal them. Not a mortal danger but...If Ellesandra was run through, left with a crippling wound...Star would be left suffering intensely for her efforts to heal them. But the utility of it was clear. Even if it meant Star passed out from the pain, she could surge Ellesandra back into the fight. And while against drunk pirates it was unlikely to be anywhere near necessary, there might come a time where it was needed. At least now, with Star keeping to her promise of honesty, Ellesandra had a chance to draw boundaries for it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had turned, preparing to walk out before pausing when Star spoke up. She stood, frozen for a moment at that first sentence. There was shock, as that had NOT been something she had been expecting at all. Then, the shock quickly morphed into anger. She turned around, eyes narrowed and glaring at Star with a fury that looked like it could burn the room down. She stepped back inside the room, closing the door behind her again, though from here - she didn't know what to do. She obviously wasn't going to stomp towards Star and intimidate her; that wasn't how she would ever deal with her anger. And this wasn't her room to break anything, which was also unhealthy way to deal with her anger. So she stood, jaw clenched and glaring at her as Star explained what happened, showed her, and then try to make excuses for it. All of these words, so much explanation, just for Ellesandra to feel the anger still there. The thing was, it wasn't anger that Star had caused pain on herself for healing her; though Ellesandra hated the idea of that, it was that Star hadn't seen fit to tell her she was testing this. She wouldn't have been happy with the idea, but Star made very good points in that it would be useful to know how it worked, in case it was ever needed on their journey. She hated the idea of it being needed, and as if she needed another reason not to let herself get injured, she resolved to ensure it wasn't. No, overall, she was upset at the ruse. It was the first breach of trust Star had done, and it coming from someone who seemed as pure hearted and honest as Star, that hurt. Well, Ellesandra's form of hurt was lashing out in anger, so it she didn't really feel the hurt itself, but it was there. And then another thought came to her mind. Could Star take the pain from her emotions, too? There was a fear that Star would try, somehow, to remove that 'nonexistant' mountain and take it upon herself. Would Star even be able to? Surely the woman was better at processing emotions than she was, but it had been three years building, being repressed, building more, and being further repressed. If or when it was ever fully released, it would probably crush whoever felt it. "You." The word came out thickly. She had to force it out in a way that could be understood. "Will never do that without explicit permission again. Ever. Do you understand, Miss Lumina?" Ellesandra would not lash out against Star physically, ever, but verbally? Returning back to title, rather than first name, was the minimal indication of how this conversation was part of their business arrangement; not of their budding friendship.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A nuance to Star's powers was proven in this moment. Ellesandra didn't need to say a word for their feelings to come across. It was instant, and Star recoiled upon seeing the anger. Rather immediately, tears formed in her eyes. Regret. Sadness. Pain. It was writ across her face as the tears flowed down her cheeks; she repressed the sobs that wished to join it, but she couldn't hide the tumultuous emotion that raged in her. "The times it has its uses are times where acquiring explicit permission may not be a luxury," came her response. She was upset, obviously. Wishing she had handled it another way, perhaps. But there was a fire in her eyes that matched Ellesandra's own. "Saving your life may require a decision that moves my body before I consciously make a decision," she continued, her figure trembling, but standing with the conviction with which she risked her life in Cloverport. "And even though you've sought to fight me at every turn to be of use to you, to help you, I won't let anyone stand in the way of keeping you safe. Not even you." She couldn't know the specific reasons for Ellesandra's anger, but a general sense was enough for the immediate moment. She was obviously scared. Not of Ellesandra hurting her. But that she might have hurt Ellesandra. Her words were soft-spoken, spoken through tears. She wasn't wishing to make an argument out of it, or disturb the elven couple. But there was an...Intense concern in her. A flame that burned behind her eyes directly straight at Ellesandra. "That's all this was. When my regular healing failed, that's all I had left. And whether you want to try and hurt me by using my last name to make distance from me or not won't stop me from caring, either. You saved me, and have shown me how much deep kindness you have inside you. That cannot be undone. I will do whatever it takes to ensure we both get to walk away from whatever tries to impede us in our travels. I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me. So just...S-Stop trying to keep me from doing my part!"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The tears should have assuaged some of her anger. They should have warned Ellesandra to back off. Seeing Star react so immediately should have told her to shut up and just leave, before things got worse. Somehow, though, they just made her even more upset. Guilt leaked out of the mountain, and as Star tried to defend her actions, defend that she would do this with or without Ellesandra's permission in the future, Ellesandra was prepared to just leave. Cut the conversation before she did something stupid. And then there was that line. 'I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me.' The mountain broke open and, completely without thought, Ellesandra stepped directly up to Star. "And I've already had one charge give her life for mine, I will NOT have another do the same." She didn't even realize she was saying the words until after they were out. Such was the way anger worked; you spoke subconscious, not even considering the impact or truth of words. The pain as soon as they left her mouth hit hard. She took a step back, hardly holding in the sob that immediately bubbled up from the crack in said mountain. It didn't matter that Star wasn't talking about giving her life for Ellesandra, but just taking her pain and wounds. To her, in this moment, they were one and the same. Star would be taking the punishment that should be Ellesandra's. She couldn't be here with Star, who she knew would be able to see how the guilt and pain completely consumed her. She spun and slammed the door shut behind her before Star could try to follow out, not even looking at Morrun or Lissana as she left the hut. She'd held back the sob just barely, but there were tears on her cheeks. She didn't make her way to her room though, figuring if Star followed she'd assume that's where Ellesandra went. No, she went straight for the meadow, hoping it would be mostly empty that evening.

Quite a lot of things fell into place in that moment for Star. Her eyes widened. Shock filled her. She was in no state to stop Ellesandra. No state to say anything. To realize that...For Ellesandra, Star's staunch conviction, the desire to do whatever was necessary to care for the knight...It played right into their guilt, into the pain that the knight felt. That every time Star showed valiance in the face of danger, it was undoubtedly making Ellesandra fear that history would repeat itself. Star didn't want to die, but...As Ellesandra slammed the door and stormed out, Star had to sit with her own thoughts and decide...If it came to it, would she give her life for Ellesandra? Would that answer change, knowing they already had someone sacrifice themselves for them? A lot was revealed about the knight's actions without it being directly revealed. And Star would remain in her room for a short while. An hour or so. But the empath was, by some estimations...Incorrigible. Time was needed, yes. But so were apologies. And try as Ellesandra might to elude Star, it remained the unfortunate truth that...A strong emotion was felt by Ellesandra. Very strong. And the stronger an emotion, the more it could guide Star. So she followed them. It was just past sundown. The early beginnings of night, with an orange haze still bleeding over the horizon as it crest over the pond of the meadow. No others were there. All had returned to their homes. And Ellesandra was free to have it to themselves. But after about an hour, Star found her way there. And if Ellesandra was still present, Star stayed out of sight initially. Somewhere close, but not intruding, as if needing to make a final decision on her plan to either walk over and speak, or do something else.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had been thankful it was empty when she arrived. She was laying down in the meadow, not far from where they had been laying just earlier that day. It was a good thing that Star could see emotion, as far away it might be hard to see her, and she was keeping quiet in her sobs. Still, they were sobs. She was curled up on her side, knees pulled up to her chest and her face buried in them. She was trying her best to put the lid back on, to take the guilt and the grief and shove them back down, back into the mountain and just pretend they didn't exist. She couldn't, though. Not entirely. The memory of Marigold looking up into her captors faces. A mix of fear and determination before the blade fell. Ellesandra was wracked with the guilt, and the pain wasn't like one who had lost a charge they weren't close to. It was heartbreak, the feeling that one who had loved another felt at their death. With Stars abilities to see emotions, it was like a major beacon pointing her to where Ellesandra was. And by the time Star found her, she had made little progress in shoring up the hole that had formed. The physical pain that encompassed the emotional, the feeling that her chest was being literally ripped open. Old wounds, the same ones experienced that day, throbbed. Her right arm, her left side, and her left shoulder. But the physical pain was nothing compared to the turmoil that three years of repressing the grief and guilt brought. Ellesandra had never properly processed her death; she hadn't let herself. On the best of days, she pretended it didn't happen. That she was out on a mission, that was it. On the worst, she distracted herself from the guilt. Whatever would do, however she could. She didn't let herself feel it, and when she suddenly admitted to that to Star. That Marigold had died to save her, she just couldn't anymore. It was the first time she'd admitted it in more than her dreams or her thoughts, and putting words to it had made it real.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
It killed Star to see the knight in such a state. To be so stricken, so alone...Star would not stand for it. Ellesandra did not know it, but their anger, their sorrow, their grief, it all left a long, wispy trail of emotion and memory on the aether that Star followed. One she could read. One she could cradle against her and feel the emotion, take unto herself the memory that brought such pain into existence. But she recalled her promise to Ellesandra. She did not dive into the memory, even if it was right in front of her. It was a breach of their trust to do so. She moved out from her place out of sight. Her own tears were plentiful, though she held her sobs in. Her pain was for Ellesandra; this moment was not about her or how she hurt, it was entirely about them. She moved to where they were laying. She laid before them. Close, but not too close. She laid on her side, though not hugging her legs to her chest to hide. She didn't need Ellesandra to notice her or react. Even if it was just that she was here with them, in this moment, so they wouldn't have to be alone as they faced such pain...That was enough. Though of course, if they did notice her, she was sure to raise the arm not pinned under her side to leave open the same comfort to Ellesandra that they offered her, even if she knew the knight was far less likely to accept such physical comforts, least of all from Star herself given what happened with that contact.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The emotions rolled from Ellesandra in waves. Guilt, pain, sorrow, guilt again. The guilt was the strongest thing, influencing more pain and grief than just having had someone close to her die. That she felt fully responsible for the death was what truly hit Ellesandra hard; that she had been tasked to protect someone, and had failed so miserably at her job it had gotten her killed. Well, that wasn't entirely fair, objectively, but Ellesandra was anything but objective in regards to this. The sobs had slowed, but she still lay there, curled up on herself and silent tears running down her cheeks. Her eyes were closed and she was much too distracted to notice Star's approach, so there was no immediate reaction when Star lay down next to her. Ellesandra's face was mostly hidden, with her head down where her forehead pressed against the top of her knees. Through bangs of hair falling around the top of her head Star would be able to see the streaks of tears, and her knuckles were white with how hard she had been holding onto her own legs. With the lack of anyone she trusted or felt comfortable with holding her, Ellesandra held herself. Eventually, she shifted, a discomfort with how she was laying, and that is when she saw Star laying in front of her. Seeing Star obviously surprised Ellesandra and she jumped, her body all but leaving the ground for a moment in the intensity of her surprise, and her eyes gone wide. And then the shame and embarrassment hit, at how she'd reacted to Star, and that Star was now seeing her like this. No one saw her like this. She'd never broken down like this in a situation where anyone had access to her before. Seeing Star's arm raise, she looked at the arm, then Star for a moment, hand moving up to wipe at her face as if to try to make herself presentable. It was a moment of indecision. She wanted the physical comfort, but did she want that from Star? Not just because of the whole touching and emotions thing Star did, but she'd known star for...not even two days, at this point. And Star had already devolved Ellesandra into a sobbing mess. Her eyes moved down to her own body again and then without a word she turned so that her back was to Star, not wanting her to see Ellesandra this way. Not wanting her to see how broken she was inside, and didn't let anyone else see. The guilt was still there, even as it was now successfully being buried again. The start of another mountain; though this one would be significantly smaller.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star did expect a rejection. She didn't take it personally. She knew she was the exception rather than the rule to how quickly people became accustomed to hugging, to touching. It was very different for her, for an empath. It was an expression of her openness and trust in others, for Star had advantages others did not. A nigh flawless insight into someone's heart, into their motivations. A moment's study was all she needed to know if someone wished her harm, either directly or subtly. Ellesandra had no such guarantees. They were their own, only source of comfort. She was okay with this for now. She wanted more, of course. But she wouldn't demand it. She could only show it with her tears, with her sorrow, with the depths of sympathy in her eyes. "I am so...So...So sorry, Ellesandra," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She kept her sobs subdued, still. "For...So many things."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond, not at first. She wasn't able to, opening her mouth and feeling just a tight throat and air whistling out. It took her a few moments of trying to calm her emotions to be able to force her throat to loosen up enough to speak. "Don't...apologize for something that is not your fault, Star, or you had no way of knowing." Ellesandra pulled her knees up to her chest again, arms wrapping around them. She was the one who hadn't told anyone anything. Star couldn't be held accountable for saying something that triggered Ellesandra when she had no way of knowing it would. And Star didn't actually do anything wrong, either. She was just trying to do what she thought was right, even if Ellesandra still had a smoldering flame of anger at her taking her pain without discussion. She placed her forehead on her knees, adopting the same position Star had seen her in when she approached, just with her back to Star now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was reassured slightly by Ellesandra speaking at all. Not so much by their words; she cared little for absolution, she knew Ellesandra was hurt, and her actions, knowing or not, were at least partly to blame. Star had her stubborn moments, certainly. But she was quicker than most to step back and accept guilt unto herself under most circumstance. Hardly perfect, but...A reminder of what was important, a reminder of the humanity of the moment, was all it took to center herself again here. To remember what mattered. "I will apologize," she said, her voice still soft, yet carrying that selfsame emotional conviction. "...Because someone has to. Your tears have no business falling alone." She paused. She had to choose her words carefully, with Ellesandra so obviously vulnerable. "I was so caught up in my own fears that it blinded me to yours. And I've far less excuse than most for that. I...Was so worried that you would keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing yourself to the point that you would break, to the point that I wouldn't be able to save you...It made me feel...Desperate. It's...No excuse. Just an explanation. So you know that though every action I've taken, I've kept you in my mind. I know the things I do can seem...Reckless. Thoughtless, even. And I can promise you it's nowhere near the truth, but...I know that can't stop that deep fear in you. Just like it can't stop it in me. So...I promise all the things I've said, still. I promise I won't pry. I promise, however, that I'll still be here, every step of the way. And that I want to know...I want to be here for you. But that I'll let you decide what to share with me." A pause for breath. "...And most of all I promise that I'll never stop fighting to stay alive. I won't let death claim me. I can't. And as much as you'll let me...I'll rely on you to make that a reality." Another brief pause. "I...Didn't come here to make you talk, though. I didn't come here to make you do anything. So you don't...Have to say anything. I just hope you'll let me stay with you, so you don't have to have to cry alone. Because my heart can't bear that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She waited, listening to Star but not really knowing what to respond to. And was there even an expectation of a response? Probably not. She appreciated that Star promised not to pry, but that still didn't make her feel comfortable with touching Star. Ellesandra didn't let anyone touch her, really; she didn't let herself be vulnerable like that, and that wasn't even considering Star's ability which immediately made it so that the walls Ellesandra did have up meant absolutely nothing. It didn't matter how good she was at hiding her emotions from everyday people; Star could literally see right through her when it came to that. So touching Star made her feel even more vulnerable than just a normal hug. The previous embrace as Star broke down earlier had been more than Ellesandra was comfortable with, but something she felt like she should do, was expected and appropriate for the situation. Now? As much as she might internally want Star to reach out and touch her back, or even cuddle up against her and hold her, she also hated the idea. And so, she laid there as she worked to finish calming herself back down. To push her emotions down enough that she could breath and exist normally again. Her chest still ached from it; the pain was still there, she couldn't get rid of it entirely. She could, however, get rid of the worst of it. Her throat was sore with the intensity of the crying at first, and her eyes puffy and red. Her nose was runny and she sniffed, irritated at it. Finally, she moved to stand up. She didn't look at Star, keeping her face turned away, back to her while she looked up at the sky. "We did say we'd come see the stars tonight." She murmured, as if that had been the reason they'd been out there - not because Ellesandra had broken down, but because they were keeping up on their promise to star watch in the meadow.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had waited with Ellesandra without another word. Without pushing herself onto them. She just watched their emotions, the turmoil, and the repression. She disagreed with that repression. It made her want to do something drastic again. To pin Ellesandra down and scream at them to stop it, to let themselves feel their emotions instead of ignoring them. But there was only so much she could push the knight before she started pushing them away with what she thought to be caring actions. It meant nothing if it evoked a defensive response that could not be overcome with sincerity and concern. "We did," she said softly to Ellesandra, then moved onto her back, looking up at the stars. "...So won't you lay with me a short while and look at them?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Hadn't she been laying here enough, crying? The thought passed her mind, and how much she just wanted to go back to her room at the inn and curl up on her bed. Maybe cry a little more, though she doubted she had anything left in her. How could one have so many tears? She glanced at Star out of the corner of her eye and took a deep breath, before moving to sit down in the meadow nearby. It wasn't laying down next to Star, but she was still keeping her company, and her eyes turned upwards towards the sky nonetheless. She sat with most of her weight on her rump, knees brought up but spread open this time, with her arms wrapped around them widely and hands held together in front of her. Her head was tilted back, eyes tracing some of the constellations she knew - which weren't many. "Any constellations or stars or anything of particular importance to your family? With your naming theme being all celestial objects like that, that is." There. Conversation that was completely neutral to the pain Ellesandra felt. Trying to be normal.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star smiled quietly. "...The night sky is different in my homeland. I was young enough at the time that the memories aren't as clear as they could be but...The constellations here aren't the same. I'll show you the constellation named after the hero of my realm when we get there. It's called 'Purity'. It's a symbol of hope. The stars align to spread out, curling slightly upward, with pockets of stars in vaguely straight lines extending out from the other stars. It looks like a pair of angel wings. It's a beautiful sight." She smiled, though her eyes were still misty. "I don't know the constellations here, despite my time here. It's not my home. Though being away from where I was born so long, and with the place I was born doubtlessly left as nothing but overgrown ruins now...I don't know if I can rightly call that place home, either. I haven't had a place to call home since I was cast away." She paused, then shook her head. "Gods...Sorry. You just asked about the stars, didn't you?" She sighed. "...They're beautiful, here. Just like you said they would be."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced sideways at Star as she talked about home, briefly, before returning her eyes up to the stars. "A constellation of angelic wings, huh?" A symbol of hope. She had to fight back the urge to scoff at the idea. She lowered her gaze back down to the meadow, looking out over it in what light was provided by the stars and the moon that evening. "Stop apologizing when it's not necessary, Star. Stand up for yourself and take up the space you need, or want." She would slowly break that habit of Star, apologizing for unnecessary things, if she stayed with Star very long. Or at least, that was her goal. "Home can be anywhere, or someone. Right now, it sounds like your mom is your home, and you're looking to return to her. If you get there and find that home has been destroyed, you'll grieve, and then you'll find a new home. It's transitory, isn't it?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star pouted a little when Ellesandra chided her for apologizing. It was hardly a big deal, so it was taken with a light heart rather than some serious admonishment of her character. "You should probably think twice before you encourage me to be even more stubborn against you, you know," she said with a glance over at the knight in turn. "I don't know if you realize how much I already hold back around you. I know I'm not exactly normal in that regard, but I've never been one to be shy about emotion." She let her gaze linger on Ellesandra for a while with those words. Not an overly heavy tone, but...That selfsame conviction appeared again here. That was her domain. The thing she stood for, even as it balanced against respecting Ellesandra's boundaries. "If I gave all that my heart desired to assert myself with you, well...You'd probably go running for the hills. I can be awfully scary when it comes to emotional matters," she said, offering a playful smile. Star? Scary? Hard to imagine. But she did listen to the words about home, bringing her eyes back to the stars above. "...It is, you're right. We're just guests in the lives of so many people that we meet. We might never see this place again. And there might not be a home waiting for me where we're going." She didn't go anywhere with those words. Just an echo of what they said, perhaps to affirm it all in her heart as she stared at the night sky. A pensive air came over her. It'd be easy to tell, as it generally was with Star, what she was feeling. Longing, perhaps. Depth of thought. A pain bubbling in her, one she was well familiar with. It hurt, still, clearly. Her desire to return home. To close this chapter of her life, so she could grieve if she must, and move forward again.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She pursed her lips at the stubborn comment. Did she want Star to be more stubborn? Ellesandra was silent as Star went on about her emotions, and home. There was a sudden defensiveness to her and she had to fight the urge to slide a little further away from Star. Leaning forward, she repositioned so she could place her chin atop her knees, gazing out over the meadow. "Assert your own emotions as much as you want." She said, eventually. "But I've drawn a firm boundary around my own. And I expect you to respect that boundary, as much as your powers allow you to." They would certainly make Star respecting her boundary hard, and Ellesandra recognized that. Normally, her boundary involved not prying into her emotions at all, but it seemed that was all but impossible for Star. Still, there was restraint Star had seemed to show. Ellesandra wasn't going to force her to hold herself back, but she would encourage said restraint in regards to herself. "We should get back, though. Long day tomorrow and I'm sure we both need the rest to prepare. Especially you with needing to meditate to ensure you are fully prepared for what you might be asked to do tomorrow."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star just bore a grin at Ellesandra's words. She refrained from comment, despite mentally imagining Ellesandra saying 'assert yourself! Claim what you want!' followed immediately by 'no wait not like that'. A terribly oversimplified thought made just for amusement, and just for her to hold onto. Something that might have Ellesandra wondering what she found so amusing, but beyond that she rose up to a seated position. She nodded. "I know. But it was important to me that I be with you in this moment. You're important to me, and I'll always do all I can to make sure you know that." She said that, then rose up to her feet, moving immediately towards where she would be sleeping, though she did look over her shoulder and smile. "Good night, Ellesandra. I'll see you at dawn. Sleep well."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Her eyes narrowed at Star as she walked away. Ellesandra was important to her, after just two days? "Foolish." She muttered to herself, quiet enough to ensure Star didn't hear her. There was disbelief there, then irritation at Star putting herself at risk like that. To care for someone so quickly was an easy way to get yourself hurt, even if Star could see someone's intentions. People might not intend to hurt others, but they did it all the time anyways. She started her walk back to the Inn, trailing Star long enough to see that she made it back to Morrun's place safely, and then taking the path Morrun had shown her the night before to the Inn to settle in for the night. She did exactly as she'd wanted to before, locking her door then curling up in her bed, covers thrown over her head, and let herself cry more. The remaining pain and guilt that she hadn't been able to repress released, and she finally cried herself to sleep. In the morning, her head ached. Her sinuses were clogged from the crying last night and her eyes were still puffy and red. She slipped out of the covers and began getting ready for the day, doing what she could with water provided to clear up her face so she didn't look like she'd spent the whole night crying despite having done so. She had woken at the first rays of the sun shining through the window, but that meant she hadn't had much time to get ready and put her armor on before they would be leaving most likely. She'd planned to wake earlier, but exhausted eyes from last night had prevented that. So it was about last minute that Ellesandra arrived to Morrun's with her pack on her back, armor on, hair up in a high ponytail, and rapier strapped to her right hip like normal, knocking at the front door if they weren't already outside.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra's restlessness was helped little by their dream. It was not one where the woman had lucidity, so it was easier to chalk up to simply tumults of the mind. But in this dream, Ellesandra wandered through a forest that was possessed by endless darkness. No passage out. No certainty of the way forward. And lurking in the edge of Ellesandra's periphery every few minutes was that same inky shadow. That black mass of darkness that stood with the reaper's scythe. A foreboding presence. One that watched, silently. One that did not impede, but its displeasure was clear. It never attacked. It simply watched, then vanished if observed. It was unmistakably the same entity that had tormented Ellesandra on the previous night. But was the demon just a manifestation of Ellesandra's repressed fears, or something else? It would be impossible to know. Ellesandra could only know that even when pushing forward, retreating, attacking, or calling out to this black monster, it did not respond. It vanished before the knight could do anything, always out of reach, yet always watching. Ellesandra would wake in time, granting reprieve from the endless black forest. Their sleep was not the most restful with less time than they might need, but it wasn't particularly disturbed. Perhaps even a break from recurring nightmares; likely less scary than seeing Marigold in their dreams. The result was an almost fully refreshing slumber, but with lingering fatigue to shake off. Some time walking would do the trick. Ellesandra's knock was met with a swift answer. It was breakfast time again, and some notice had been taken of the knight's desires. Ellesandra's plate was given an extra helping of breakfast meats in the way of sausage and bacon, while Star's had a smaller helping of these while piling it more full of fruit and vegetable. Lissana was clearly paying attention. Morrun had syrup-soaked pancakes again, which he ate with glee. Smalltalk was the air for the morning, unless the knight had specific questions or subjects to raise. If not, the group was destined to part ways here, and Morrun and Lissana were sure to send the two off with some prepared bundles of rations. Fruit preserves, nuts, berries, cured meats, even two portions of salted cuts of meat that would last a day or so on the road without spoiling to serve as a good night's meal over a campfire if nothing else could be secured. There was an obvious priority to what would need to be eaten first, but it certainly beat roasted squirrel in terms of quality. It would be the last chance the two had to say goodbye unless they chose to return to this grove another day, or some time in the future.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra definitely hadn't slept well, with the paranoia of that shadow lurking everywhere. And now in the waking world, Ellesandra's paranoia continued. The shadow was too coincidental, to be in both dreams, for Ellesandra to shrug it off. Now, she was looking around, keeping an eye out and watching the shadows as she'd gone to Morrun's, and even while eating. Ellesandra stared at the extra meat on her plate for a moment, blinking a few times and looking over to Lissana in confusion, before eating it anyways. She was quiet throughout the breakfast, introspective and obviously tired, and when they were given all of the supplies for the road, she smiled at Lissana and Morrun politely in thanks. Her dreams had been bothering her, leading her to be even more quiet than normal that morning. As they prepared to go, Ellesandra was looking around, then looking to Star. "Are we supposed to be meeting up with anyone this morning?" As compared to last night, Ellesandra's emotions looked much better controlled and repressed. The mountain was now significantly smaller, and there was a small hole in it that Ellesandra didn't even notice, but the emotions were still held down under it. The main emotions today were a combination of embarrassment, at how she'd acted the night before and how Star had seen her, combined with that paranoia, and concern for Star if something went wrong here.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had noticed, obviously, that something was different. Ellesandra wasn't themselves, but to some degree that was to be expected given the night prior. Star kept up some smalltalk during breakfast. The provisions were taken with humble thanks, and hugs were given to both of the elves before departing. They didn't seem to react to the touch. Perhaps they already knew what it was like to touch Star? Either way, she smiled at her companion, concern in her eyes but one that was passive. There were other things to focus on at the moment, and time to talk on the road. She nodded. "The guard is gathering at the gate. We should head there. The departure will begin in an hour or so, so we're in no rush to be among the group, but there might be an address to hear before that." Star then began to lead the way to the gate, with Ellesandra in tow. But along the way, well, she couldn't help but ask: "...Is...Everything all right, Ellesandra? I mean, aside from the obvious from last night. You seem...On edge." More than seem, she could see it. "Is it just worries about the fight ahead of us?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched the hugs with eyebrows raised. So many people were okay just randomly touching someone they hardly knew; Ellesandra couldn't understand it. Even before the incident, only a rare few were allowed to get close and hug Ellesandra like that. She shook her head, following Star towards the gate and keeping her eye out, when Star asked about her being on edge. "I -" To say she had dreams of something in the shadows? Biting her lip, she glanced sideways at Star, then back to the road ahead of them. "I have a gut feeling something bad might happen, so I'm on guard." It wasn't a lie, persay. It wasn't the whole truth either, though, and Ellesandra knew that Star would be able to tell that. Even without the ability to see emotions, Ellesandra was being too paranoid and guarded to just have a 'bad gut feeling'. Specifically, Ellesandra was watching the shadows, not specific people. She had a bad gut feeling that the shadow wasn't just a dream, considering it had been in two different dreams now. She had a bad feeling it meant more, though Ellesandra didn't know what exactly. Maybe the threat wouldn't be today at all, maybe it would be later, but she wasn't going to let her guard down and have it appear from the shadows without her knowing.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star could very easily tell that the answer was deflective. She frowned. She could see that there was more to the answer, though it did seem to be at least hinting at the truth. The unease she could see in the knight was a solid indication of that much. "I don't suppose you'd care to elaborate? If you have something in mind, it might be prudent to share. Something that I might be able to keep an eye out for as well. I don't expect much to go wrong today but...If I can know of any potential dangers, even if it's just a feeling...Two pairs of eyes are better than one. I take...Your worries seriously, you know. Not that I need any more reason to look out for my own self-preservation, but you being distracted could cause its own problems. If I know what you're worried about, I'll be able to watch and call out to you." A specific decision to frame it as her looking to Ellesandra for help, rather than facing the danger herself. She certainly seemed to have taken Ellesandra's fears seriously.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She pursed her lips together. Damnit, Star was making sense. Sighing, she looked around again to ensure no one could just overhear. It felt a little childish, admitting she was on edge because of dreams. "I've had...bad dreams the past two nights. It's not unusual; I do have recurring nightmares, but they both involved something completely new this time. A shadow that seemed to imply you were in danger. The first night it did, anyways. Last night, it was just...following me. Everywhere I went, it was there, somewhere in the shadows, watching. The first night I thought was just a strange nightmare, but that the same shadow was there for a second night in an entirely different dream, not recurring, has me concerned it might be something magical and not just imaginative." There was concern that Star would just laugh at her for being scared of her dreams, but it was minor. If she was then - who gave a damn, right? Ellesandra was taking her job seriously, and right now that seemed to be a potential, real threat. She was going to treat it as such and if she were more paranoid than normal on a day they were potentially marching into a battle, well, that wasn't really a bad thing was it?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star frowned at the revelation. "...Hm. I recall Nina telling me she had similar experiences in the past. I had thought it was related to her trauma, however, as neither of us ever encountered such a thing in our travels. But for you to experience it too...It can't be a coincidence. Tell me, did the shadow wield a scythe? That was the only other detail that Nina conveyed to me as significant." Hardly one to laugh at the news, Star was clearly taking it very seriously, and would have even if not for the past correlation. "I don't want to make you feel I'm dismissing your concerns, and I'll certainly be on the lookout too...But I hope it's reassuring to hear that we were traveling for years and didn't encounter such a being, whatever it was. It might be an entity that is contained within dreams, but...I'd rather not speculate with so little information."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra came up to a halt when Star mentioned the scythe. She turned concerned eyes onto Star, reaching out to stop Star from walking as well with a brief touch to her arm and ensure they faced eachother. "The scythe didn't make an appearance last night, but the night before it did. It was going to cut you clean in two. And said that you were in danger and would die on your journey." Had her and Nina, Star's previous guardian, had encounters with the same creature? Why was the creature warning Star's guardians but not her? She crossed her arms, eyes narrowing at Star herself. For a brief moment, there had been suspicion that it was Star's doing, but she quickly waved that away. While technically possible, she couldn't imagine Star manipulating someone like that. And Star didn't know Marigold, so how would she have been able to see that in order to play on those emotions in the dream? Unless Star could see more than she'd let on...suspicion rose again, but was shoved down. "It might be reassuring that in years you two didn't encounter it, but the fact it reached out to both your previous guardian and myself is more than coincidence, Star."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star nodded. "I'm certainly not delighted by that news either," she said, showing a flash of...Concern? Fear? A bit of both. "Like I said. I will be vigilant. I'd dismissed the danger before, but I can see that whatever it is has some interest in those around me, if not specifically me myself. I'll be on guard." She did seem a bit shaken, but it had been clear many times over that Star wasn't one to let fear grip her. She sought to master her own emotions, after all, and serenity and calm were literally exuded from her very aura, so any actual show of fear was rare from her thus far. She stayed in place as long as Ellesandra did, not wanting to rush them if they wanted to discuss further. "I won't let any pirates have my head, neither will I a dark spectre. If it is a threat...We will face it together, and I will support you. I won't face it alone, if it is something to be faced. I hope you'll take the same stance."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt even more disturbed, now that she knew this wasn't limited to just her own dreams. The image of of the shadow's scythe cutting towards marigold, then star, then marigold, then star - the pain from last night seeped out of that hole, just a little and Ellesandra winced at the imagery that came into her mind. No, she wasn't going to let the reminder cause her to focus on those emotions again. A deep breath was taken, before she nodded and began walking again. "Well, my job is your protection, so I expect you to run and trust me not to martyr myself if I tell you to run." She didn't actually expect Star to do that. She hoped Star would, but did she trust Star to put her own life over potentially Ellesandra's? No. She fully expected Star would disobey a request like that and knock her over the head for even making it, but Ellesandra would at the very least try, in a situation like that. They hadn't really fought together enough, or at all minus that initial interaction when Ellesandra first stumbled upon Star, for Ellesandra to feel comfortable and like they were a team in battle. It would be a while, before that happened most likely. "Just try not to exhaust yourself so much I need to carry you out of danger though." A teasing note, to lighten the mood.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I do trust you. And I trust you not to tell me to leave unless it's an absolute last resort. You're not allowed to die on me, either," she said, meeting their demand with her own. Obviously neither one could help it if death came for them with overwhelming force. But the understanding the two were trying to find with one another was to do all they could to live. Both had seen too much death of the ones filling the opposite role, even if that amount was a single, irreplaceable person. She then smiled at the teasing note. "Emergencies only, promise, even if you do give a good piggy-back ride," she said, raising a hand up as if swearing an oath on the matter as her smile grew. With that settled, and the mood a tiny bit lighter, she moved along with Ellesandra to the gate. It was time to make their move. And move they would; the gathering at the gate was an impressive number of soldiers. Enough to vaguely match the numbers of the pirates, based on estimations. Walking around the city and seeing what sort of ship the pirates had, there were in the ballpark of fifty pirates, not counting the five dead ones. Looking around, there were just about thirty five elves gathered, most of which had both a longbow and a shortsword for armaments. Three of these elves were wearing green robes instead of leather armor, identifying them as the healers. Star moved to stand with them; around them was Ellesandra's company, seven elves with simple spears and iron kite shields, as well as longbows. The rear guard seemed more specifically focused on close combat, with the remaining elves looking specifically geared for longer range combat. A few at the front were donning half-plate with two sheathed shortswords. Not a siege army by any measure, but certainly a force to be reckoned with. The directions were delivered by an older, though gracefully aged elven man who spoke of sanctity of the grove, and many of the points that Star had touched on, with callout specifically to how they had harmed a respected member of the grove in Lissana. The knowledge that one of their own had been harmed did seem to ignite a fire in the standing men and women, which was unlikely to surprise given the communal nature of this settlement. There was discussion that the elite guard would remain at the grove to keep the civilians secure, delivered with a line about not fretting for home while purging the lawless threats of their neighbors. Of course, the entire speech was delivered in elvish, so there was a chance Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it! Star certainly did, keeping a smile about her as she listened. But before long, the speech was over, and the group was on the move. Orders were relayed, the group split into smaller teams and moved together, with a few select individuals lugging large packs, presumably of supplies and/or food. One of the elven men standing at the front stayed back to join with the others of the rear guard, presumably the team commander. He specifically nodded to Ellesandra, acknowledging them as part of the fighting force, but didn't give any specific instruction other than motioning for the rear guard and the healers to follow. The guardsman naturally took up position both in front and behind the healers, ensuring they were the most heavily protected; the bulk of the forward force was the general forces, so most of the rear guard stayed behind to keep the squishy healers surrounded. As standard as things came, if it wasn't for the threat of the shadow that had Ellesandra so paranoid, it might even border on boring.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, accepting what Star said. She had no plan to just off and die for no reason, if she could avoid the death. She quickly identified which group was the healers, and followed Star over to them. Her eyes roamed the rear guard, sizing up all of the elves there while the speech was being made. Not knowing elven, Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it. Well, okay she might have caught one or two words just from hearing them multiple times in travel, but nothing to actually understand what was being said. The nod from the team commander caused a nod to be given in return, and Ellesandra moved to walk off to the side. Staying with Star directly would look like a lack of trust in the guards and would likely impede on her ability to interact with the other healers and make any plans necessary there; they needed to meet and trust one another and such for what might be coming up. The same could be said for Ellesandra and the rest of the rear guard, but she didn't try to integrate with them. A well formed company didn't need a stray mercenary stepping in and ruining any of their organization. Ellesandra instead walked off to the side, where she could easily see Star and get to her if something were to happen, but also keep an eye out around them. With the threat of the shadow, Ellesandra kept her guard up despite the number of soldiers around. None of them were looking for something in the shadows, but Ellesandra - and maybe Star - were. So for the entire trip, Ellesandra lightly rested her hand on her rapier and watched, used to long treks like this.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The trip took until dusk. There were multiple organized stops for the soldiers to take half an hour to tend to personal business in the woods, rest their feet, and take some time to eat. There was no point arriving exhausted and dying. Everyone had to be alert on arrival, and the instructions given ensured they would be. Star seemed content to chat with the other elves, though she did so in elvish, as seemed to be the preferred language for obvious reasons. A confirmation that Star did indeed speed more than just common. She was ever the social butterfly, though even in elvish it would easy to pick up on the shy mannerisms of the mystic. Eager to be close to others and be merry, but with that selfsame demure attitude. Star did look around at times, and was sure to check in with Ellesandra during the rest stops. Just to confirm they hadn't seen anything, and to assess their emotional state. Nothing unusual there, or during the entire trip. So it came. The moment of assault. The town was cloaked in the fading light of the nearly set sun, people were returning to their homes. A small contingent of elves moved from the main force and into the city, bows at the ready and arrows nocked. They clung to the walls, moved through the shadows. An initial force that capitalized on the element of surprise, seeking to find locations and take out targets of opportunity in the city. The healers, including Star, set up off the main road in a medium sized clearing with easy access from the road, but the elvish spellcasters cast some magic upon the other edges of the clearing which raised thorny vines up through the gaps in the trees, sealing the clearing to a single entry while allowing in an emergency for the spell to be undone and retreat into the forest. Naturally, the rear guard commander calmly issued orders to his force to station around the entrance to the clearing, but out of sight. Vigilant, but not telegraphing the location. Two of them ascended up into trees to conceal themselves and act as scouts, some others took up posts amidst the trees. The captain instructed Ellesandra and two other elves to act as ones who would receive, guard, and direct wounded back to the guarded clearing. This also ensured that Ellesandra would have view over the city, as the port city was on mildly lower elevation by the water than its surrounding landscape. Just as when approaching from the south, Ellesandra would have a view over a good portion of the city, its port, and the ships in port. Decently far away, to be certain. But that distance didn't stop the knight from feeling...Something. Something sinister lurked. Something dark. The creeping dread of the shadow was theirs to feel, despite the shadow being nowhere to be seen around them. Focusing on the feeling, it certainly did seem to be coming from the city. More specifically, somewhere amidst the pier, on one of the boats. Far enough away that it could not pose a true threat. But the sensation was the same. Was Ellesandra just being paranoid? Was it some trick? Some spell cast on them? It could be a million different things. But that distant, foreboding feeling was not coming from within. Something else was making the knight's spine tingle, making their skin rise with goosebumps..
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet for most of the trip. During the rests she'd greet Star and ensure she was holding up okay, not getting too tired from the march, and chat with a soldier in two in common when their curiosity got the better of them and they wanted to know who she was. She just introduced herself as Star's hired guard, a mercenary who travelled the lands and hired herself out to caravans, individual travelers like Star, and merchants who are concerned about bandits on the road. This seemed to cause them to dismiss her, which Ellesandra didn't mind at all. While she'd served in an army before, she hadn't actually spent much time marching with them because she'd quickly been pulled for personal guard duty and the work that went into being a soldier was very different than the work that went into being a guard. They were not interchangeable, at least not efficiently. They kept their eyes out throughout the march, accepting their stand-off status from the rest of the rear guard. She knew she'd just get in their way; even if they fought like the soldiers she'd been trained with, it had been too long. Plus, with them being elves and knowing the little she knew about how they tended to fight, she wouldn't be able to keep up with them in their own way. When they got to the location, Ellesandra had stayed back, frowning as her paranoia seemed to just increase at the sudden bad feeling she was getting. She nodded to the orders she'd been given, accepting them and not arguing or causing issue, but her eyes kept straying out towards the peer. That bad feeling felt way too similar to the shadow in her dreams, and she looked back towards where Star was. Could she feel it? Could she sense Ellesandra, if she looked? Ellesandra didn't quite know how her emotional sight worked, but with how they were currently separated and her being prepared to receive injured, she might not be able to talk to Star before the chaos began. Frowning down at the city again, watching as the elves did exactly as Ellesandra knew she couldn't do, she kept her hand resting on her rapier. The bad feeling didn't go away, and Ellesandra tried something. She didn't know if Star would be able to feel it or see it, not while Star wasn't actively looking at or paying attention to Ellesandra, but it was worth a shot. She tried to take the feeling of caution, the concern and paranoia that she was feeling, and focused solely on that feeling. It made it bigger, more worrisome for her, but also she was trying to make it look like a beacon for Star, so Star would know that Ellesandra was concerned about something. "Cursed emotions." She muttered to herself, not sure if she had done anything, and after only a moment or two of that deciding not to focus on it more so as to not send herself into a paranoid panic and attack the first movement she saw. She needed to be at least relatively cool-headed when the chaos broke out.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Had Ellesandra's plan worked? While the knight might not be able to be certain, the results were hard to argue. Star separated from her group, passing reassurances to those who looked concerned that she was leaving the protected area, to approach Ellesandra. Things were still calm. She might not get another chance, she surmised, to speak to the knight. And when she did approach, the knight's experiment would prove validated: "What's wrong?" Star asked as she walked up beside Ellesandra. She looked out over the city with no specific reaction forming upon her face, then back to the knight. Concern was upon her features. "Do you see something?" Seemed she had been able to see Ellesandra's beacon, and didn't seem to be picking up on the same sensation, unless it for some reason wasn't bothering her the same way it bothered Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced back at Star and her hand tightened on her rapier at the sudden words. She hadn't expected Star to actually approach and say anything, frowning and looking around at how she was no longer back in the protected encampment the rest of the healers were. The idea had been just to ensure Star was on the lookout, not letting her guard down. Still, best to just explain and get her back to where she was protected, right? Turning, Ellesandra pointed towards the pier, where she was feeling that odd sensation from. "I feel something bad from that direction. It...feels similar to the shadow. I just wanted to ensure you were keeping your guard up, so be careful." It was interesting that Star couldn't feel it, the one who could usually see emotions and such, but perhaps that wasn't too odd? Her previous guardian could see the shadow in her dreams, but Star hadn't been able to. Was it somehow haunting Star, but not directly? She didn't know, and honestly didn't know enough about creatures that might be able to do that, or other magics that would. She shifted uneasily, glancing around, and then back to Star. "So get back in there, I'll see you when we bring people in, but don't let your guard down just because there are guards all around you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked over to where Ellesandra pointed. Again, nothing specifically seemed to jump out at her, but she looked back to Ellesandra and nodded. "I understand," she said simply. "I'll keep an eye out. If there are any malevolent presences that come close, I will call for you." She smiled. A reminder that someone with ill-intent, even if there was some duplicitous scheme afoot, would not be able to sneak past her, as well as an assurance that she wouldn't do something dumb on her own. A reinforcement of her commitment to letting Ellesandra be her guardian. With that, she moved calmly back to the protected area. Some time then passed. The tension in the air rose as silence fell over the city. The covert beginnings of the operation were hard to read. Was everything going smoother than expected? Or had something gone wrong? The answer might never be known, but it was not overlong before the start of the chaos was upon them; a magical bolt of light shot up into the air, exploding high in the sky to shift into a massive beacon of light in the shape of the holy symbol of Corellon - a crescent moon with starry fixtures overlaid on the midsection of the crest. It was the signal to start the assault, clearly, as the elves set to charge in all at once rose their fists with a battle cry and began down into the city. The beacon hung high in the air, shining light down on the city that had been bathed in night by the time the assault began. Then, the beacon shuddered with magic, and the illusory roar of a dragon bellowed out from it. Screams from civilians could be heard as they ran from the roar to the safety of their homes. An effort to clear the streets and prevent innocents from being caught in the carnage. It was difficult to observe any direct encounters from the vantage point beyond the city limits, but the small dots of movement could be tracked in the sections of street that were visible. The pier was the most easily seen from beyond the city, and indeed the pirate ship had its own commotion. Pirates emerged onto the deck and began to pour out down the connected ramp to the dock, charging into the city to meet the elvish incursion. But it wasn't long before the wounded began to arrive; there was a clear effort from the elves to minimize loss of life on their side, as the soldiers that came back initially were sporting light wounds. Enough that they could keep fighting, just not at their best. A few debilitating injuries did make their way through after the first few, however, and the number of injuries certainly might strike Ellesandra as higher than expected. Were these the same idiotic, arrogant pirates they had faced? While these elvish soldiers were by no means trained enough to go toe to toe with a knight, they were still disciplined enough that working together to put down such a threat ought to be easier than the steady flow of injured made it seem. No dead had shown up quite yet, and many of those who were injured were capable of heading back into the city to fight the good fight some more, but with what was known about the enemy, it certainly might tickle at one's suspicion. Then, explosions began to resound from within the city. Loud ones. Bombs, of some sort. Loud enough to echo through the chaotic thrum of distant, shouting voices and blades meeting blades. Soon after the bombs started to sound, a heap of wounded began to arrive with grievous wounds - bones protruding from legs, limbs blown off, half-burnt faces and blackened leather armor filled with dozens of shards of ceramic. The first few dead. The frequency and number of injuries were quick to put a strain on the healers, including Star. A cursory glance would be all it would take to see the fatigue building on all of them. They were going to be tapped out before too long, and there didn't seem to be any end to the wounded, or the fight.  
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The calm before the storm was, in some ways, worse, than the fight itself. She watched, eyeing the town and waiting for it to happen. The feeling had never gone away, and she found her eyes straying towards the pier over and over, trying to figure out if it was ever moving closer to them, or at all. The illusory magic that broke out to signal the attack was impressive, causing Ellesandra's eyebrows to raise, but she didn't comment on it. A good way to get citizens off the street, even if it clearly signaled to the enemy something was going on. At first, as the few injured soldiers came in, Ellesandra was getting annoyed at the state of their wounds. This wasn't her encampment to give orders around though; she was just there to help and to guard Star, so she kept her complaints and irritation to herself. The concern was obvious, that these small wounds were going to tax the healers when it wasn't necessary and prevent them from being able to handle the larger and more dire wounds. Maybe the elves were assuming they wouldn't get many of those, but you didn't make assumptions like that when anything could go wrong in a fight. Ellesandra helped those who needed it over to the healers tents then came back to the front to do the same again, eyes flicking towards the battle frequently. The bombs exploding happened just as she was returning to the entrance and she paused, staring at the smoke rising in the air. "Willing to bet that wasn't us." She mumbled, uncaring if the other soldiers around her heard or not. She narrowed her eyes at the town, wondering how the pirates were putting up such a fight. Either they had known something was going on, they had a lot more numbers than was originally assumed, or they'd gotten reinforcements somewhere. Or maybe a combination of them. Any of these sounded bad for the elves though; had they potentially taken over the city's defenses and turned them inward onto the elves? She soon didn't have time to think about this as the more dire injuries were brought forward, moving quickly to help bring the injured soldiers into the tents as stable as possible to prevent pain before going out to get more. At this rate, the healers would be overwhelmed, and on her second trip back with a soldier who had bad burns and his shin bone sticking out of his leg, she stepped up next to wherever Star was and murmured - "If they haven't already, you need to convince the other healers to put off anyone who is obviously going to die or obviously not going to die and focus on the ones you can save. Healing every small cut isn't sustainable." Hopefully the healers knew that, but she at least wanted to ensure Star was following it. She knew how much Star hated seeing death, and the concern was there for her even through the caution and paranoia that still settled within Ellesandra.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was certainly a rising unease among the other soldiers around Ellesandra. The bombs, the flow of injuries, it had everyone Ellesandra could see wearing worry for their comrades and the success of the operation. They had intended to blitz in and scare the pirates off, then sink the fleeing ship. Pirates were selfish. They wouldn't lay down their lives to protect a captain they didn't respect or fear, and it was far more likely they would run than face death for someone else. Or at least, that was the common understanding, the one that this plan was based on. Yet so far, it didn't seem to be going that way. They were facing fierce resistance. Star looked up when she saw Ellesandra. The instruction given was met with a nod. "Mmn...We've been keeping our magical healing in reserve, using the supplies we brought for the lighter wounds, and stabilizing those we know we can't get back into the fight with what we have. But something is wrong, Ellesandra. The fight should have been over by now, shouldn't it?" she asked, looking at her knightly companion with dread in her eyes. She wasn't saying it, but the implication was there in her eyes. Was what Ellesandra had felt somehow responsible? The shadowy essence was still in the city, through it was no longer on the ship. It was...Roaming. Just as Star was asking this of Ellesandra, a shaken elvish soldier began to make a commotion with some of the rear guard. The man had blood over his face and leathers, and his right arm was limp and held by his left, suggesting it was broken. The elf had tears in his eyes as he screamed something in elvish at his comrade. The words might mean nothing, but the tone suggested a desperate plea of some sort.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pursed her lips and nodded. Yes, the fight should have been largely over by now, but obviously it wasn't. Obviously, something else was going on here. Turning to see the elven man yelling something in elvish at his comrade, she took a deep breath. "They should retreat and reconsider their situation. And that feeling...it's moving through the city now, Star." She mumbled. She had no sway over the elven commanders or soldiers, though. As much as she disliked the idea of the elven soldiers continuing to fight, she had been trained to follow orders in a situation like this. She hadn't been trained to be the one making the decisions, so for now she would go back to doing what she had been ordered to. For as long as there were still soldiers fighting and coming back, she would ensure they got back to the healers to at least be looked at, glancing over her shoulder at the town and keeping track of where the shadow was - or whatever the feeling was coming from, if it wasn't the shadow specifically.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a difficult look at Ellesandra when hearing their words. She obviously seemed inclined to agree, that further loss of life was not worth the cost. But she also had been the one to advocate for this. For her to go and ask for retreat now would not put her in good graces with the leaders. It wasn't her place. She just nodded to Ellesandra, with a look of guilt overtaking all else as she set about getting back to her duties. Was it a sunk cost situation? That some had died already, and it was now too late to give in? Was it that the lost life needed to become greater before the bleeding would stop? One could not know, but anyone familiar with elvish culture knew it to be a stubborn one, one which did not accept changing their mind easily. Were they going to fight to the last? Time would tell. But before such thoughts could be explored significantly, Ellesandra was perhaps the only one who would then feel the shadowy presence shift. Suddenly, instantly, it was close. Ellesandra and the rear guard stood where the ground leveled out after a lazy incline coming up from the city. The secured clearing was behind the rear guard, with a road running north-south past the city that joined perpendicularly with the road leading from the city. The T-shaped intersection of the wider, main dirt road and thinner road to the city was where the guard was stationed; the treeline was a handful of meters beyond the edge of the main road. And from the thin road, the one to the city, the shadowy presence encroached. It would not be long before it was revealed: The pirate captain himself, clad in a long black cloak that was open in front to reveal a bare, hairy chest soaked in blood, along with a feather-adorned black hat, sturdy black bottoms and heavy black boots. A single scimitar in one hand, and an eyepatch over one of his steely grey eyes that stared at the guardsman with contempt; his lips held a mocking grin behind the fuzz of his scraggly, long beard. The captain was flanked by four other men who looked to be pirates of some experience. "Right then boys, which one of these pointy eared fuckers you reckon killed me first mate, eh?" announced the captain as he walked, casually, up to the peak of the road to step onto level ground with the guard. Naturally, the guardsman were immediate in their response, forming a defensive line with a wide berth. They were there to fight to the death to defend the healers, but they relied on the first strike to come from the hidden rangers in the trees. Given the open hostility to these pirates, the hidden rangers did not hesitate. Two arrows flew straight and true at the captain the moment a shot was lined up. Yet as commendable as their alert attention to threats was, the captain responded with a thrust of his free hand forward. A magical pulse boomed from his presence, sending a forcible rush of air ahead of him; the arrows destined for his skull glowed with mana as they were sent flying back to their origin, striking each of the hidden rangers who fired them. Two dull thuds into the grass made clear that the arrows struck true, hurting or killing the hidden guardsman. With that, the captain smirked in this moment, sizing up the guards that stood between him and the healers in the back. The chaos, the roar of battle, resumed in the city. It was the moment before battle; Ellesandra could remain passive and wait for another to strike first, or she could lead the charge, or perhaps try to talk it out if she was so inclined. But the source of the shadow-presence in this area was clear: The captain was bathed in it, whatever it was. A dark, malevolent presence. Yet it wasn't as strong as the one Ellesandra encountered in their dream. It was an echo of it. A fraction of the presence. A part of it, but not the true self of the presence. Perhaps touched by the presence, or commanded by it. Its nature was difficult to discern, but the hatred that suffused it was undeniable. That the captain would kill them all unless stopped by force of words or blades, there was no doubt.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The moment that she suddenly felt the shadow closer, Ellesandra froze. She felt the caution and paranoia turn into concern for Star, but the shadow was still on the road; not in the encampment. Ellesandra's hand was on her rapier as she walked forward, giving away to the elven guards around her that something was wrong before they'd even seen the captain. When the captain appeared, Ellesandra felt her stomach turn. It was him, with the shadow. Was the shadow a creature attached to him, some sort of possession? Or some sort of cursed, magical artifact he was using? She eyed the shadow cloak he had, wondering if that was what it was, not moving as he shouted out about someone killing his first mate. She'd hoped the arrows sent would take care of him, but of course that would be too easy. She watched as him and his probably handpicked pirates stood across from the guards. Based on his magic, the rear guard were likely no match for him as a group. The other pirates certainly, but he would sew enough chaos that they would suffer heavy losses. Not to mention, Star had mentioned he was quite nasty, hadn't she? Taking a deep breath and steeling herself, Ellesandra stepped forward, to the side of the rear guard soldiers to ensure that if the captain used any magic as an attack rather than talking, she didn't have to worry about them getting hit by it too. "That would by myself. Unfortunately, your first mate was a little unwilling to let an unfortunate hostage go. Perhaps you would be smarter than him and retreat now? Unless you'd also like to have my rapier through your heart." It was a goad, to get him to turn to her or send one his men after her. Either way, she wanted to even the odds for the soldiers. She would prefer if he came after her, with her ability to potentially redirect his magic or counteract it, but she'd take whatever she could get. The elven soldiers had suffered enough at this man's hands, likely. The thuds that had resulted from the redirected arrows were proof of that. Still, Ellesandra hadn't drawn her rapier, left hand simply resting on it's hilt, body loose and ready to fight. She'd dueled plenty of times, and she'd also fought against bad odds before, too. She had the scars to prove it; and she wouldn't let him or his shadow get into the rear encampment where Star was.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra's words proved effective towards their goal. The captain rolled his shoulders. "Well then, I thank ye for making the search an easy one!" proclaimed the captain in his deep voice thick as the mud that clung to his boots. "Keep the knife ears busy, lads, leave the runt to me," he barked. The pirates around him then rushed forward to engage with the rear guard. Metal met metal as the fighting began with them, and while they rushed to meet each other, the captain approached Ellesandra who had purposefully put themselves off to the side. Goading the pirate was as easy as ever, it seemed. But that he was looking for a fight hardly was in question. As he walked towards Ellesandra, his imposing six-foot-four, muscle-bound figure carried the shadowy presence all around him. Its source was difficult to place. Attempts to focus on it were met with an elusive, guileful magic veil. As he drew closer, his free hand weaved magic, then thrust forward towards Ellesandra. The effect of the magic struck the knight instantly, though how effective it would be remained to be seen; the magic was that of the spell Compelled Duel, which if it succeeded in affecting Ellesandra would ensure it would be difficult for them to run away, and magically compel them to be unable to attack anyone but the pirate captain himself. Not that Ellesandra likely intended on doing so anyway, but the captain seemed quite intent on fighting the knight one-on-one to exact his vengeance. He also, clearly, had no idea what abilities Ellesandra had, given that he was pleased to throw a magical, targeted spell at her expecting it to work. Though depending on how versed Ellesandra was with magic, she might find his ability to cast that specific spell...Odd. It wasn't every day one encountered a pirate able to use magic, let alone a spell usually employed only by righteous paladins.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced at the elven soldiers when the captain ordered his men to attack them. Well, that was best case scenario for her. She got to fight the magic wielder and not have to worry about his henchmen, while the guards wouldn't have to worry about the captain. She didn't gave away that she was pleased with this turn of events, though, turning to eye the man approaching her. Slowly, she drew her rapier and held it out in front of her, setting herself in a battle stance. When he shoved his hand forward to cast at her, she smirked. The magic poured into her mind, and then spread throughout her body. While most people would immediately feel the full effect of the spell and the need to fight, it didn't effect Ellesandra the same way. There was no visible sign if the spell had any effect, nothing to throw him off his guard that all that really happened was she was more inclined to fight him than before. It wasn't like the spell 'failed', per say. It hit it's mark, and Ellesandra wanted to fight him more than she had before; not that the spell had been needed to make her want to do so rather than running. No, while she would still be able to run, she was less likely to do so; it would require more of a drastic situation than normal to make her decide to flee. But what the spell also did was fuel her mana reserves, and as it settled in, Ellesandra made the same signs with her right hand that she had when she first encountered Star. She'd ensured that there was enough distance between the captain and herself that she could get her defenses prepped, unless he was able to move and attack much faster than she'd expected. The haste spell settled in around her, a light yellow glow, which immediately made her second spell casting faster. While the light yellow glow soon settled into her skin to be very subtle, a more evident blue glow surrounded her form. A magical shield, one that would help her absorb and deflect incoming magical attacks. With the spells in place, Ellesandra eyed the man and prepared her defense. Unlike the other pirates she'd faced, she had to assume this man knew how to fight well - and dirty. So she would keep her eye out, and play defensive at first. Get the feel for how he fought, and use her speed and dexterity to slip in for a hit when he let his guard down.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain didn't seem to realize that something was amiss. He was getting his duel. It was just a little less...Compelled than it was voluntary. With that set, he let loose a chuckle at seeing the rapier. "Ol' Salteye was put down by that pointy stick, was 'e? Pathetic excuse fer a first mate," he muttered to himself, then dipped his hand into the pocket of his cloak, pulling out a ceramic sphere of some sort. He opened the fight by throwing this sphere at Ellesandra's feet, where it exploded and sent out jagged, rusty nails in all directions. Some even flying back to hit him, though they bounced off some unseen force and landed on the ground in front of him instead of hurting him. The blast itself was concussive enough to stagger, but the damage was far more likely to come from the shrapnel of metal and ceramic. But he didn't charge in blindly. He waited to see what Ellesandra did in response, keeping distance enough between them as he opened the fight to give him time to react to Ellesandra's counter. Or, well, what he assumed was enough, not knowing that speed was one of Ellesandra's greater strengths.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was good she'd taken the defensive, then, because if she'd been in motion to attack she wouldn't have been able to avoid the apparent grenade of shrapnel. Ellesandra had started moving as soon as she'd seen the item coming at her, not sure if it was magical in nature or not and what it might do. This put her out of the main concussive part of the blast, having circled around to the side quickly so that it only caused her to take a step back, but it didn't get her completely clear of the shrapnel. While her armor blocked a good amount, the tings seeming to pop off of the magically enchanted plate, Ellesandra gave up protection in some areas for ease of movement. One piece of shrapnel slammed into her left thigh, cutting deep into it, and another into the area just above her right elbow. This one was lucky, both that it was her right arm, and also because that arm had been thrown in front of her face, as the shrapnel otherwise would have hit hit her in the face instead. She quickly recovered, feeling the pain of both hits but neither of them debilitating by any means. Pushing off of the ground with her good leg, she shot forward quickly, rapier ahead of her to feint an attack at the Captain, and then to quickly withdraw and attack again. Ellesandra wasn't going for a killing blow, not expecting to be able to end the captain easily at all, but would take whatever openings he gave her. A cut to his arm, a slash across his thigh, or wherever he left open in her feint, careful not to commit to any attack in case he had his own magical protection or quick response and she needed to dance out of the way or move again to prevent getting hit herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain wore a wide smirk as the grenade went off and scored some hits. Then, he watched with his one eye as the knight encroached. The feint was successful, drawing the man to try to knock the blade away with the flat of his scimitar, only to have the draw-back and quick follow up score a clean strike across his arm. The cloak tore, and the slash left its mark on his arm to pour fresh crimson from the wound. Not terribly deep, and the man's arms were thick enough with muscle that it was unlikely to impede him to any significant degree. The swift strikes that followed earned another strike on his thigh and another at his side. The man was slow, but burly. The cuts were hitting, but he didn't cry out in pain or even grunt, as if the strikes had no effect. Of course, the effect was clear. He was bleeding. He just had a strong constitution. But with a low growl, the captain threw his blade-bearing arm out and upward, his eye aglow with red mana; in the wake of his wild swing at nothing came a forward rush of thunderous force; the magic of a Thunderwave that came out suddenly to blast Ellesandra back and leave their ears ringing. Whether or not her shield could absorb this or if she had the strength of balance to avoid being flung onto her back from it remained to be seen. This was certainly no ordinary pirate captain, regardless.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The hits scored were good; she was more than happy to wittle him down. Taking on someone who was obviously as physically strong as him one on one for a quick hit wasn't going to work; not with how small and physically weak Ellesandra was compared to him. While she had muscle, her right arm was all but useless under heavy weight, and she had no chance to compete with someone of his size in strength. Ellesandra didn't even try to move out of the way as she saw the red mana glow in his eye though, smiling. The thunder wave caused her to skid back about a foot and the force knocked the breath from her, but beyond that it's effect on her was not what the Captain surely expected. The magic slammed into Ellesandra - but not through her. The effect of it knocking her back was obviously reduced, the physical force being absorbed into her mana and shield, but what came after was Ellesandra's right hand waving back at the Captain as the magic that did get absorbed was sent right back out in his direction. Not being a targeted spell, it wasn't something that she aimed at him, but more in his general area. The effect was significantly reduced; probably only enough to make him take a step back if it took him by surprise, but Ellesandra was following up immediately afterwards with her rapier, looking to take advantage of this. The downside of redirecting area spells was that, as all redirects were about half as strong upon the return, area spells were significantly even less because the only bit that Ellesandra absorbed of the area spell was the bit that hit her. The positive, in this situation, was it was likely to take an enemy by surprise. Ellesandra herself felt the wear in her body from the redirect. It wasn't easy to do, or light on her to do so - and the more powerful the magic, the more it effected her. There was a limit to how much she could absorb, which is where her magical shield came in to help deflect the remaining bit. But if a spell was too powerful and Ellesandra tried to absorb or redirect it, it was still liable to punch straight through her resistance and seriously injure her - and even if not, the forced flow of magic that was not hers through her body was a quick way to wear her magically out. So when Ellesandra stepped forward with the rapier, looking to take advantage of the surprise, she aimed at places that would have a serious impact. She doubted he'd be taken so off guard to go for a killing strike, but one placed in the crook of his elbow, or his underarm where it would limit his arm movement and cause continued pain if he swung his sword? Those were her targets.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain initially smiled upon seeing the knight sent back a few feet, and took a step in to capitalize on that, only to have the magic indeed catching him off guard in thinking he had the advantage. The result being that the counter wave that hit him knocked him off balance, enough to make that step forward turn into a swift step back to keep him from toppling over. He was wide open for a moment, but swift enough to regain his composure that he could get a last-minute reaction to impact the knight's advance. So it was, her target for his elbow struck true. Their blade struck swift and whether slash or thrust was true enough to strike to the bone. A solid hit. And yet, the captain remained unfazed. No lethargy or impedance could be observed in his motions as he gave a few swings with his scimitar mostly aimed at forcing Ellesandra back, for staying close while he swung would invite his experienced hand to trade blow for blow and give the knight a wound of their own. To play smart and patient demanded they step back, but if Ellesandra continued to aggress, then they would certainly suffer a slash across an unarmored part of their frame for whatever aggression they sought to impose. With his elbow liberally leaking blood, it was either a feat of constitution on par with a raging barbarian, or something else that kept him from showing the effects. Perhaps time was all it needed. For the moment, the captain was growing increasingly impatient with this dance, and took this moment to fish into his pocket with his free hand again. Last time it was a bomb. This time, his hand flew from his pocket with a fist full of some glittering dust, and as he released it towards Ellesandra it exploded into golden, blinding light. Magical in nature, certainly, for the purposes of Ellesandra's resistance. The strategy was clearly to blind Ellesandra, continuing to fight as dirty as possible, if only for a moment. The goal? The captain charged forward, arms out, to throw himself at the woman and attempt to grapple her, using his superior strength to tackle the woman to the ground and pin them under all three-hundred pounds of the dirty, muscle-bound man that he was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was dismayed that her strike into the bone of his elbow hardly fazed him at all. The first few swings were easily dodged, her haste helping her to pull away and disengage, suffering only a minor cut to her left arm that she'd barely missed dodging. She didn't push her luck fighting in again, instead dropping back with the plan of looking for another opening. It had become obvious that something was fueling this man beyond what would be considered the normal; whether this was magic or simple physical constitution Ellesandra didn't know. What she had surmised was that she did need to go for a killing blow; wearing him down over time wouldn't work. That, or simply stalling until the elves had dealt with his men, and could wittle him down from all sides. Unfortunately, with her haste spell and the fact she'd already redirected an AOE spell, that wouldn't work for her. The lethargy that would hit her when her spell ended would be more than enough to spell her death, most likely. This is normally when she would consider leading him away from others, then escaping, all while looking for an opportunity for a killing blow. It was also where the Compelled Duel discouraged it. While still possible for her to decide to lead him away, the magic worked against that thought. And thus, when he decided to make his next move, Ellesandra wasn't quite as far away from him in her stance as she normally would have been. Seeing him reach into his pocket, she'd prepared to move, backing up to create distance, and then seeing him throw something she'd covered her eyes and ducked, expecting and preparing herself to defend against another bomb. It wasn't that though; this time it was a blinding light that exploded. The thing about magic like this, was it wasn't the magic that hurt her. There was no force hitting her; there was simply light. While the light was magical in nature, it was the brightness of it that hurt her, not the light itself as if she were a vampire, so her resistance had been minimal use against it. Her saving grace was that she'd pulled back enough and prepared, covering her face, so she wasn't completely blinded, but she had definitely been dazed. Dazed enough that she hadn't been able to dodge out of the way when he suddenly appeared through the light, charging forward to grappled her. She had, however, recovered enough to make her own response to it. She raised her rapier, it glowing golden itself briefly so that it was empowered to pierce through solid stone and letting the man skewer himself if he continued just like the First mate had done, but considering how he ignored his previous wounds she hadn't stopped there. Her right hand had reached behind her, grabbing the dagger tucked beneath her armored skirt, and raising her hand up so that when he slammed into her and knocked her down, her arm wasn't stuck beneath her. The impact hurt, a lot. Her breath left her lungs and she heard a rib groan - had it cracked? - at the weight of the man pinning her body down. Her armor helped prevent any major crushing for a moment, but it wouldn't last long if he decided to start wailing on her. Her right hand had been held above though, dagger still in it, and as soon as she recovered from the brief shock and staggering her mind went through from the blow, she turned and used all the force left in her weakened right arm to slam the dagger towards the man's head; aiming for his ear or his eye, depending on how he positioned himself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The back and forth was coming to a head. Trading blows was getting neither side any significant ground, not for lack of trying on Ellesandra's part. A deadlocked fight that could go on for hours or until Ellesandra's haste ran out. Unfortunately, it seemed the fight with the elves and other pirates was similarly deadlocked. Both sides were looking worn, but the fighting continued. The chaos from the city kept up as well. All this was the backdrop for the captain toppling Ellesandra and mounting her. The captain jumped on Ellesandra's rapier, letting it skewer him through the lower chest. A punctured lung was his, certainly, as the rapier pushed straight through him and out the other side. But where the first mate had tensed and locked up at that trauma, the captain showed furtherance to his inhuman constitution as he continued as if he was entirely uninjured. He dropped his sword and moved his fat-fingered hands around Ellesandra's neck as they fell to the ground, immediately squeezing in and attempting to choke the life from the knight. Then, the dagger came. His muscly arms being directly down on Ellesandra's neck made it the easier strike to go for the ear and drive the dagger into his brain. And he hadn't the reaction time to block her. So the dagger struck true, straight into his ear, straight through into his brain. And that should have been the end of it. He should have spasmed and fell on her, gross as his blood-and-sweat-soaked, shirtless self was. He should have. But he didn't. The metal blade was jammed clean into his head. The resistance of bone was felt and passed. The dagger was in his brain. And yet...He kept squeezing, with strain showing on his face as he exerted his muscles to try and crush Ellesandra's neck. But of course, Ellesandra wasn't alone in this fight. They never were. And seeing the dire state of the knight, there was someone who was certain to throw caution to the wind and meddle. "Leave her ALONE!" came a cry from a familiar voice, one that was choking back a sob. Then, a surge of mana blossomed from the source of the voice. Intense, powerful mana. Star was standing just within Ellesandra's vision beyond the pirate captain. Ellesandra had seen Star's aura before briefly. A soft, blue glow that had a wispy, airy quality to it. Fluid like water, flowed around her like smoke. But in this moment, it was a brilliant, radiant aura that blossomed well beyond her body. The ground around Star cracked and splintered as if bolts of lightning shot out from her feet through the soft earth, leaving scars of brilliant blue out from all around her as a deafening boom of mana exploded from her. Star's eyes shone aglow with bright blue energy, wholly suffused with mana as she put all she had into this moment. She thrust her hands forward at the pirate captain, and at her mystic command, the captain was wrest away from Ellesandra in an instant, pulled up to a standing posture, arms throw to the side and head cocked to the side; a square of mana formed under him, with a diamond inside that square, and spectral, ethereal chains of mana shot up from the four corners of the square. It was a familiar sight to one familiar with the magic, the spell Hold Person, which paralyzed and trapped the pirate in place, separating from Ellesandra. Star was holding the man in place. Her power was palpable; the magic in the air crackled, free to be absorbed in its bountiful, nigh endless quantity. Blood began to drip from Star's nose as she held this; she grit her teeth and bared it, locking the pirate in place. "Kill him! End this, Ellesandra!" she cried to her companion. A request easier said than done, surely. If the dagger in his brain hadn't killed him, what hope was there in ending this man? A thought that surely might possess Ellesandra, only for the shadowy essence that the knight had felt to converge in once place upon the man. His heart. Mana was building within it, ready to burst and free the man from the spell, breaking him free to continue his campaign of carnage. But in so doing, exposed the source of his power. Ellesandra had but one moment to strike, but the answer, the true weakness of the pirate, was exposed before the knight. It required only that the knight put everything they had into one final strike.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was lucky he didn't just crush her neck, considering his potential strength. The air had already escaped her lungs from him tackling her, so it was on her attempted intake of breath afterwards that she was immediately blocked from doing so. It hadn't stopped her from stabbing him in the ear, which she had expected to cause him to freeze, loosen his hold, and then topple over or on top of her, at worst. In none of her expectations did he just ignore a damn dagger into his brain. She didn't have time to be shocked, as once she realized the attack didn't kill him she was reaching to try to pry a fingerway from her neck, just enough leverage to try to get a breath in at least, struggling with the obviously stronger opponent. Her vision had begun to blur, blackening on the edges, when she heard Star. Her head snapped to the side to look at her at the shout, then she began gasping as his hold suddenly loosened and he stood, becoming paralyzed in the process. She saw the chains wrapping around him and felt the thickness of Star's magic around her, but she didn't pull on it. How much energy had Star already expended in the healing of soldiers, and then this spell? No, but she did reach for her rapier, still in the man's lung, and ripped it out. The rapier still held the light yellow glow about it, strengthened to pierce through almost any armor or even through a wall, intended to ensure he didn't have any magical defense that would shrug it off, and her eyes focused on where she felt that shadow coalesce. Her breathing was ragged and it took a moment for her to focus her aim as well as drawing in large breaths, but with the last of her strength she stepped forward and thrust with her rapier, allowing the blade to pierce straight through his heart. She quickly released after striking, however, and stumbled back, falling on her ass with a wince at the pain that shot through her rib - okay, he had definitely cracked one of her ribs when landing on her, at least. The real reason for the stumble, though, was her haste spell ending. Between the blows she'd taken and the lack of air, her concentration on it had been slipping. She'd forced herself to hang on long enough for the last strike, but now as it was ending she felt like her muscles had just gone through a full day's worth of strenuous exercise. Her body ached and was sore all over, with large bruising marks around her neck and she was sure bruising on her right ribs beneath her armor, and she was still gasping for air - her airway finally starting to be able to take in air normally again and not just in a gasping, weak strangled way. She hoped that strike would kill him, because she didn't know if she had another left in her. And damnit, she'd never had someone keep fighting after she stabbed them in the head. What the hell was that?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The blade retreating from the man's torso saw blood pour out. The man bled, like any other. But nothing stopped him, it seemed. Until, of course, the rapier pierced through his heart. Or...Where his heart would be. For Ellesandra's blade did not find flesh at his core, but rather something hard. Not hard enough to resist the bite of the rapier, of course. Whatever hard thing was there in place of his heart cracked under the piercing force and the rapier sailed clean through. It was then, and only then, that the man showed any pain. The spell holding him in place broke, not because Star lost her grip on him, but because the moment the blade pierced him there, he died. His breath hitched, his eyes rolled back, and blood poured out of his lips. The shadowy essence fizzled, then burst, scattered away and leaving Ellesandra's senses entirely. It was gone, now. And with that strike, the pirate fell to his knees, then became coated in a black energy, and crumbled to ash soon after, leaving nothing in his wake but a pile of ash that was once the man himself, and a small, spherical gemstone amidst the pile that had a pierced hole clean through it in the shape of Ellesandra's rapier. The gem was intact despite the hole through the center; it was large enough to take this strike and not split in two, though was still only slightly larger than the circle made by a pinched thumb and index finger would make. Easily fit in the palm of one's hand. Something that cemented the man as not human at all, or at least...No longer human, once that energy imbued him. But what was more? The other pirates reacted to the death of their captain. They looked dazed. Lost. Like they had been snapped out of something. Of course, that drop in their guard was swiftly met by death blows from the other guardsman. Star then rushed to Ellesandra's side, her eyes returning to their normal pretty blue irises. She knelt beside Ellesandra, hands ready to reach out to touch Ellesandra and heal them the way only she could, but...She stopped herself. Ellesandra's words echoed in her mind. She looked at the knight, blood dripping from her nose. "...Please, Ellesandra. Let me heal you." Despite the stubbornness she had shown before...Seemed she was heeding the knight's demand that she be given permission, at least in a moment where that was an option. Tears were forming in her eyes, and her hands shook. Star was rattled, but she was unharmed. She had a lot of power at her beck and call in the moment, the only question being how exhausted Star would be in the aftermath. What price she would pay for healing the knight in this moment. And in the moments where Star awaited an answer, the chaos of the city died, replaced by a unanimous cheer of victory from below, echoed by the guardsman nearby as their weapons raised, standing victorious over the corpses of the pirate threat.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra sat on her ass, looking up at the man after he seemed to completely freeze - and then turn to ash? Ellesandra frowned, watching her dagger fall as he turned to ash, and the ash and some sort of gem settle on the ground after. "Th..the hell?" Ellesandra had defeated created and monsters before, but none that just turned to ash. They were all flesh and blood of some kind, which was why she'd felt so betrayed at how her dagger in his damn brain didn't do anything to slow him down. Her voice had come out raspy, the choked sound of a damaged wind pipe, and she blinked, turning to look at Star afterwards. Ellesandra was dazed, and a bit in shock. Her eyes turned from the remains of the creature, up to Star who seemed to hover over her and say something, then over to the pirates who had just, stopped fighting. And then they were slaughtered. She frowned, a touch of pity for them. Had they been mind controlled, or otherwise influenced somehow? If that was the case, did they need to have been cut down like that? She blinked, realizing she'd gotten distracted from Star and looked back up at Star. Her eyes turned to the shaking hands, and then up to the teary eyes. "Stop that." She ordered in a gruff, grumpy tone. Her hand came up to take Star's, squeezing it lightly in reassurance, before letting go and flicking her hands away from Ellesandra's body. "I've be-" She paused, coughing, then cleared her throat with a wince and spoke again. "been through worse. Mundane healing should..." A deep breath was taken in as she had moved to try to stand. Yep, definitely damaged a rib. Broken or fractured, she wasn't sure, but it hurt like a sonuva. "should work." They knew it didn't sound convincing, considering their stopping and the obvious pain they were in, but the important thing was it wouldn't kill her. And as long as it wouldn't kill her, and the danger was past so she didn't need to protect Star, then she could deal with the slower, mundane healing that would come with it. She did, however, hold her hand up, requesting assistance in standing up. Star pulling her up would help relieve some of the pressure from her rib when she pushed herself up. The emotions through her were mostly relief, that Star was fine and that she herself survived it, confusion and irritation that stabbing him in the brain had done nothing and at herself for getting put in that situation, and concern for the rest of the injured.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's reaction was naturally an emotional one. The contact of touching Star's hand was brief. Reassuring as it was, and brief as it was, it didn't stop a tidal wave of worry, concern, fear, and a bundle of associated emotions from pouring into Ellesandra. Something that flooded them with a magical force that overwhelmed any attempted barrier to be put up, which had the side effect of proving that the ability to separate the two was at least in part intentional on Star's part for every other time they touched. There was no holding it back this time. A momentary connection that would allow Ellesandra to know, without a shadow of a doubt, the depths of concern Star had for them. For how scared she had been, and continued to be, for the knight. As well, a healthy dose of frustration at Ellesandra's resistance to the matter. She did help them up, but the macho reassurance didn't work. She looked possibly more upset. "W-Wh...Why, Ellesandra? Please...I don't want to see you suffering, and I see the way you're flinching! There's gotta be some internal damage!" Despite her protests, she was still asking permission, rather than forcing herself on them. For now, at least. As she protested, the soldiers began to work on the post-battle actions. There were corpses to remove from the city, and discussions to be had with the local lord if they were present. As well, the black, spherical, broken gemstone was still on the ground in the pile of ash left by the late pirate captain.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The overflowing of emotions, the concern and fear for Ellesandra, hit her like a brick. She paused, the barrier between herself and Star having crumpled at the touch. It made her hesitate to take Star's hand to help stand, but she honestly needed it so she did it anyways, flinching at the overwhelming feeling of how much Star was concerned for her. "How do you even feel that much?" The question was rhetorical, not even meant for Star to hear. Star was so full of emotion, and right now it was all concern for Ellesandra and she didn't know how to handle that. Star was feeling more concern right now than Ellesandra had let herself feel anything for the year before meeting Star. Once she was standing she moved her hand to lightly support her right ribs. It was hard to do through her armor, which she'd need to remove in a bit to actually tend to her wound, but the instinctive motion to grip her side didn't matter if the armor was there. "Help me to somewhere to sit." She motioned to the encampment around the other healers, glancing again at the ashes and stopping, grumbling and moving to kick at the gem with her foot. Did she trust picking it up? She didn't sense the shadow being from it anymore, though that didn't mean it wasn't still cursed in some way, shape or form. She definitely didn't trust Star picking it up though, so taking her rapier she speared through the hole she'd already made and tilted the sword up, letting the gem fall down the sword length and just hit the hilt. Using her other hand, covered in gauntlet to prevent skin to potential magical artifact touching, she pulled it off the blade and put it in a pocket. Then, she sheathed her sword and motioned to her dagger. "And would you pick that up for me? I suspect bending over would hurt." She had ignored the question at first, but after making the requests her eyes turned to Star and watched her for a few moments. "And because I can handle the pain. I'm sure you can too, but I'm not dying, Star. I won't let you feel my pain for me anytime I'm injured just because you can. At most, depending on how bad my rib is, I'll let you use some mundane healing to force enough heal in to mend the bone if it's broken. But not the entire wound itself, and not your sympathetic healing or whatever you called it." Her voice was still raspy, but had become more steady now that she'd been getting air consistently. It would probably be raspy for the next few days while it recovered, but hopefully it wouldn't cause any longterm injury.

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star heard the question, and it was enough to sober her slightly. She was in an overwhelmed state. Her emotion was intense, but a response from Ellesandra that bordered on humour was something that gave an instinctual reminder that Ellesandra wasn't dying. The crisis had passed. The storm had quieted. Star's aura receded more, becoming only slightly more prominent than usual. One could only wonder how powerful the emotion was when it had caused her mana to overflow and create the lingering scorch marks on the dirt; a blackened circle with lightning-like arms stretching in all directions remained where she had been standing. A testament to Star's potential, though even if Star had showcased unique powers thus far, unique did not necessarily equate to powerful. The moment she had intervened and saved Ellesandra from the captain, however? That had been power enough to face the entire army of pirate, surely. Yet, it had not been harnessed. All things that the knight might consider when a broken rib wasn't a far more pressing concern. Star observed the gem, but she was too focused on her companion to really ask questions about it. She bent over to take the dagger as requested and handed it to Ellesandra before supporting them by wrapping her arm around the shorter woman's back, mindful to not hold too tight and put pressure on their chest. She looked disappointed and worried to hear that the knight didn't permit her to take the injuries herself, placated only by the notion that they would permit her to mend the bone, at least. "It is broken," she asserted as fact. "It needs attention, or it may not set correctly and impede your ability to fight. We should be trying to return you to your prime and see if we can restore the strength in your right arm, not giving you another lasting injury to slow you down." She refrained from making a pointed remark about Ellesandra's ego, here. Why did all the proud fighters have to wear wounds like badges of honour? "Part of protecting me is ensuring you are keeping yourself in peak fighting condition, wouldn't you agree?" she said as they reached the secured clearing, so she could ease Ellesandra down on a wooden log that had been conjured to sit on like a bench. There were padded bedrolls laid out to rest on if Ellesandra preferred to lay down. Star had seemed to calm herself at this point; the contact steadily became more separated until the barrier between emotions solidified once more. Star was still dripping blood from her nose, though that too had slowed. Her frame was still slightly shaking, but that too had been subsiding. She looked at the other healers doing their work. There were still more injured, and the last trickle of wounded were arriving from the fight in the city. Star looked like she was going to call some of the others over to heal Ellesandra, but...A mental calculation dissuaded her from doing so. Perhaps she thought their skills were better used on their own, given how much more it would take to tend to the knight. Regardless, she placed a hand on Ellesandra's neck. Her hand then shone aglow with white light, and she showed strain in her face as healing energies poured into Ellesandra. Her hand trembled, but she forced through this. Two minutes of concentration later, and her hand eventually fell off Ellesandra's neck, with sweat pooled on her brow. Exhaustion was more than obvious; this effort had renewed the bleeding from her nose to a steady drip. But for her efforts, the magic had forced itself through Ellesandra's wards enough to set the bone in their ribs and mend it. It was still tender; the surrounding muscle was beyond her capacity in the moment to heal, so bruising and some small internal bleeding was left untreated. The other cuts were also left without treatment, and Star was plainly beyond tapped out, pushing into reserves even greater than her last exertion with her shimmering armor. She'd done enough to ensure no lasting damage was done, and this time it seemed it wouldn't take Ellesandra admonishing her to get her to stop. She hit a limit that certainly wouldn't cause any lasting harm, but...Despite her unfaltering spirit, she had hit the limit of what her body could safely take. Exhausted, she sat on the log beside Ellesandra, chest slightly heaving. Eyes shut. Sweating and hot on the forehead. Bloody nose slowly clotting. She was a mess. And yet...She smiled. It hadn't been a victory without cost. But it was, still, victory. Evil had lost on this day, and Lissana might yet breathe a heavy sigh of relief when the news reached them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't come around enough to notice the black marks, not until they had started walking by them. She had taken the knife and slid it back into it's sheath beneath her armored skirt, right up against her leggings. She was bleeding from a spot in her thigh and arm, as well as the bruising around her throat and likely on her rib. Now that the adrenaline had mostly gone, she was feeling the pain and winced a bit more at it. The touch from Star, to help her along, was almost refused - not because she didn't need the help, but because touching Star was overwhelming right now. Even with her barrier the concern was pouring through, at least at that moment, and she didn't like how much of it she felt. As they passed by the scarred land, Ellesandra looked down at it in surprise, but didn't comment on it. She also glanced over to the soldiers, to confirm they hadn't been completely wiped out and were at least faring better than maybe she was. Still, she hdidn't say anything until she was brought into the healer's tent and to a makeshift bench, sitting down with a sigh of relief, leaning her head back and pressing back into the bench with one hand on her side. She needed to get her armor off soon, so it wasn't bothering the wound. Only after the danger was confirmed over, though. "How do you know it's broken?" She asked, in regards to Star asserting it. Oh, it probably was. With the way it hurt, she was just lucky she didn't feel in pain in her lung or trouble breathing, meaning the broken bone hadn't gone into her lung. Her armor had really done wonders in helping take some of that man's heavy form. "I'm not saying you're not allowed to heal, just the bare minimum, Star." Just enough that it could heal properly on it's own. The rest could be mended with mundane means, without Star exhausting herself or taking the pain on herself. Feeling Star place a hand on her neck made her jerk, surprised at it's placement. She wasn't about to heal the throat injury, was she? But no, Ellesandra felt the magic attempting to flow to her rib. She had to actively force her body not to try to absorb the magic, like it naturally wanted to do. She could ensure that she didn't absorb it, though that didn't make it any easier to actually cast into. Her innate resistance was still a thing, and Star would feel like she was trying to shove her magic through a thick, muddy sludge of a body. Ellesandra hadn't been paying attention to Star, which was her bad, because when Star stopped she was obviously exhausted. Ellesandra was breathing better and the pain was definitely lessened, but Star had obviously pushed herself too far. Reaching over, she lightly wiped at the bloody nose to wipe some of the blood off of Star's face, frowning at her. "You went too far." A protest that was useless, since it had already been done. She sighed, leaning back in the chair and looking around at the other healers. She'd recover for a moment before seeing about wrapping her other, more mundane injuries. "I don't think I'm going to be carrying you back this time."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Says the woman who had a broken rib," said Star back, wearing a smile despite the obvious exhaustion in her voice. She looked up at the knight, her eyelids heavy. "...I mean it, though. Me being the sort who is often in the backline, often out of danger...What gives me any right to work any less hard than the people putting everything on the line?" she asked, perhaps rhetorically. She looked out over the other healers. "...I might feel like hell for the next day or two. But I'm still breathing. That's more than I can say for some of the fighters who came here today to do what needed to be done. Don't mistake my words for suggesting I want to take their place, but...There are going to be friends and family who will endure incredible pain when we all return, and their worst fears become reality to know that this morning was the last time they saw their friend or loved one alive." She paused. "...I have no right returning to the company of such people unless I've given every last drop of my strength in the fight. For no matter how much I sacrificed today, they certainly sacrificed more. I will recover. There are some who came today who will not." She again went quiet for a time. She drew in a heavy breath, then lowered her head. "...I always know what other people feel, remember, Ellesandra? It can take time to focus on it but...Your aura knows all that ails you, physically, and emotionally. A touch is all it takes, though...The connection is almost never as automatic as it is with you. I have to...Actively try to separate us, where with most I have to actively try to form that bridge."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She rolled her eyes about the broken rib. It wasn't like she intentionally broke her rib. What choice did she have, let the captain just sweep through the elven guard? Hell, she would have died if it weren't for Star. That feeling settled uneasily in her gut, remembering the man hovering over her with his hands on her neck, knife in his head and not stopping. The surprise she'd felt at that moment when he just...kept going. Fucking hell, it had been a long time since she'd felt fear like that. not since - The flash of emotional pain made her wince and reach down, pressing her thumb against her thigh wound to send a spike of physical pain through her own body. It quickly refocused her thoughts away from where they were and she cursed under her breath, as if she hadn't expected the pain even though she'd done it intentionally. Taking a deep breath she leaned her head back and stared up, at either the sky or the enclosed vines. "It isn't your fault, those others who died. And it's not because you gave any less than they did. So stop that shit, or self-blaming. It isn't healthy." Kettle, meet pot. She knew this in the back of her mind, but didn't comment on it. She also pushed her guards down just a little harder at the idea that Star had to fight to prevent the bridge between them, rather than working to form it with other people. That idea bothered her; if anything, she would very much have liked the choice on whether or not to let Star into her emotions. She didn't currently have that, and the vulnerability of it bothered her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I'm not blaming myself," she snapped back, exhausted as she was. "I'm saying I hold myself to the same standard. That if they are willing to die, I'm not content until I've run myself ragged trying to keep them alive. When I face the grieving faces of those who must face the ultimate loss, I need to be able to genuinely tell them I did all I could." Another pause for breath. "...I certainly saved at least a few lives here today. And that's about the only thing that can keep me from actually blaming myself for the ones I couldn't. I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to fight as hard as you do, Ellesandra. That's...All I've been trying to say every time I've begged you to let me help you. But since we're on the topic of telling each other to stop unhealthy habits, I'd be remiss to not mention you jamming your thumb into your womb to repress what you were feeling just then. I'm...Doing my best to respect your privacy on the matter, but I don't know how much self-destruction you expect me to be okay with."  
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra blinked in surprise when Star snapped back at her. Perhaps she had misinterpreted, then. There was no offense taken at the snap, more just surprised the usually polite and kind woman had it in her. A brief reminder to herself they'd known eachother for just a couple of days; plenty to still learn if they wanted to. Ellesandra wasn't sure how much more she wanted to, since Star had already learned more about her than she was comfortable with. Still, she listened to the rest, watching Star silently, until she turned the topic back on her. Ellesandra turned her gaze away, jaw clenching, and a mixture of defensive anger and discomfort rose. She had to fight the anger down not to snap at Star herself; she'd already done that last night, and look how that had turned out. Instead, there was silence for a moment before she pressed her left palm down into the bench and pushed herself up with it, standing with a wince. The rib definitely felt better, but it wasn't like the pain was all gone. Not only that, but the thigh and arm didn't feel great either. She didn't go far, ignoring anything Star said until she located some of the mundane supplies for wounds and brought them back to the bench. She sat, and without a word slid her leggings down enough to begin tending to the new injury on her thigh, like she had the other day. Her lips were pressed together and, while she wasn't really trying to give Star the silent treatment as a punishment per-say, she wanted to make it clear that line of conversation was not open, and pushing at it would just make Ellesandra withdraw - because she would. She had agreed to guard Star; that was all. She had not agreed to be her friend, even if that's how their relationship was going so far. The silence was also a good time to push down that defensive anger, and the bit of shame that was buried deep within it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star watched the other woman silently get up and busy themselves. Star had things she felt strongly about just the same as Ellesandra. A standard to which she held herself. A duty to other people. An overwhelming need to embrace altruism and reject selfish desires within herself. She wasn't physically strong like Ellesandra. And to date she hadn't shown particular prowess at any offensive magic either. Being able to paralyze an opponent certainly was potent, but only assuming there was someone who could deliver the lethal blow waiting nearby. She couldn't guard people like Ellesandra could. So she had to do other things to look out for people around her. It hurt her to see Ellesandra turn silent on her. It hurt her more for that to be triggered by hypocrisy. It already took a mountain (that didn't exist) of patience to not throw herself at Ellesandra and SCREAM at them to stop pushing everything down. But...Star was, if nothing else, patient. Even on the verge of passing out from her exhaustion, she held patience. She took Ellesandra's lead about silence, then took some of the medical supplies for herself. Not to apply to herself, but to tend to other wounds she could see on the knight. Just because they were giving her the silent treatment didn't mean she was going to stop caring about them and their health. It would take a lot more than a stubborn pout to turn off Star's altruistic nature.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra jumped when she felt Star reach for her arm. A glance to the side made it obvious Star was reaching to help tend to the wound, and she sighed. "You're too damn good, Star. Be a bitch back sometimes, it would help." She gave Star a wry smile, before holding her arm out in an angle that helped Star to access the shrapnel wound just above her elbow. She'd been lucky it hadn't hit right in the elbow, because unlike the damn captain who just kept swinging after being struck there, it would have more severely impacted Ellesandra. Would she have been able to bring the dagger into his head if she'd been hit there? Probably not, not that it really mattered anyways. Another wince came, though this time just from the general ache and muscle fatigue that came from her using the haste spell to it's full duration. She could rest for hours, if she let herself. Would the camp rest here, to take care of their wounded? A glance was given around to see what the plan was. "What's the plan for getting back? Or are we going back, or leaving from here to our next destination?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I'll just feel worse if I'm mean to you," she said, offering a sincere smile at Ellesandra. It was true. A little misunderstanding was all it took to make Star bawl her eyes out. "If you need more motivation to ease up, I can always work on my puppy-dog eyes," she added, being as gently playful as she could be with her words given her state. Though the notion of Star somehow looking even more like a kicked puppy when receiving harsh words was a scary one. It already took so little to get her misty-eyed when it was someone she cared about. She worked on what wounds she could, demonstrating a clear skill with medicine, though her motions were slowed considerably by her exhaustion. She was liable to pass out once the adrenaline waned. She already looked a little unsteady now and again. "I'm sure Morrun and Lissana would accept us if we need to go back. But I think the decision is one we should make together. You were the one who demanded I take an extra day and rest...I'll probably need two or three days to get back to full strength after today. But hells if I'll be able to march back there. I'd sooner find an inn in Cloverport to pass out in than even think about marching that distance again. Hell, this log is looking pretty comfy right about now, even. Just hold still until I'm done dressing your wounds, if nothing else."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra just imagined Star giving her puppy eyes and was immediately effected by just the imagination. "Do not ever do that." She said in a serious tone that was much more fear that Star would do it and she'd bend immediately than in actual seriousness about her doing it. She finished bandaging her own thigh, delayed a bit by using only one hand while Star bandaged in her right arm, and then watched as Star finished up her arm. She used her left hand to reposition her leggings back in place, settling back in on the bench and sighing again. "I agree, that march back to the elven settlement would be too much for today. Need to find somewhere to rest now, but I'm not sure an inn in Cloverport will be the best, do you? If there are people who remember us and blame us for the attack at all, or the damage or death caused by it, it might be bad for us in our weakened states. Perhaps you can rest on the bench for a bit while I ask the elven commander what their plan is, and decide from there?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept up until all of Ellesandra's wounds were dressed. Her work was good, even in this state. She knew her way around properly cleaning and dressing a wound. Thankfully none were deep enough to require stitching. Her hands were too shaky to hold a needle still at the moment. She nodded to the plan, though couldn't help a lingering smile at the idea that she could sway Ellesandra with puppy dog eyes. She'd never do so maliciously. She couldn't. But if it was all in good fun, she was perhaps even more inclined to try it, given Ellesandra's response. A little secret for her to keep, though the smile on her face was at least a little bit telling to her inner mischief maker. But, serious topics once more: "Mn, that sounds like a good plan. I'm sure most of the soldiers feel the same, and not just forced march but carrying the wounded I'm sure isn't high on everyone's priorities. Still...I have to wonder. I noticed how the pirates reacted to the captain dying. I have to wonder if there was some magic at play, something that affected the townspeople as well."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited until Star had finished entirely bandaging her, and then moved to stand again. She grit her teeth at the ache in her muscles; yep, she definitely needed some rest. "I don't know, there was the gem that fell out of the captain but...I don't want to bother investigating it until we're both well rested. It's entirely possible it's cursed in some way and I don't want to deal with that in our fatigued state." She looked around, trying to find the rear guard commander. "You lay down and rest. When I have a plan of where we can stay, I'll come get you." She also hoped that she would be able to wake Star, because in her current state she wasn't confident she could lift and carry the mage. As small as Star might be, Ellesandra was weaker than ever right now, and with her right arm being out of commission for lifting things she'd be hard pressed to just fireman carry Star anyways. The mention of Star healing that arm came back to her and she pursed her lips, not liking the idea even if Star had a point. "Will you be okay while I go do that?" She wanted to ask before leaving, and asking also got her mind off of the discomfort with the idea that came up.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft nod. "I've made friends with the healers, I'm sure they'll smack anyone who tries to bother me," she said with a smile. That she made friends was hardly a surprise. She moved to lay on the log and looked to be quite swift in falling into a light sleep. Talking to the captain would reveal the plan was to make camp among the trees when spoken to, and that Ellesandra and Star were more than welcome to join them, that a tent, a fire, and provisions were plentiful, and plans were already being made for a rotating watch to guard the camp. A safe place to rest for the night was theirs, and with Ellesandra bringing the topic up had the captain starting to bark orders at soldiers to begin the preparations for the camp. Bedrolls and communal tents were planned, though the travel food would prove to leave a little to be desired. Military rations were meant to last, not be tasty, after all.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, glancing at said healers at the mention. Now that she was standing her legs were screaming at her. It wasn't pain, per say, but just the absolute fatigue that came with pushing your muscles too far. Taking a deep breath, she confirmed that Star was laying down and alright before she headed off to the commander to inquire about the camp's plans. With confirmation they would be setting up camp nearby, Ellesandra began making her way back to the healer's tent and locating her bag, which she'd placed down after they'd set up camp. The tent was folded up within it, but as she stared at it she realized she really did not have the energy right now to set it up. Instead, she looked over to the healers, and deciding their tent was good enough, she just moved to lay down her bedroll next to the bend Star was laying on. A spare blanket, small but still a fur blanket, was placed over Star's resting form, trying not to wake her. If the healers needed them to move, they'd tell them. Until then, Ellesandra needed just as much rest as Star probably did, and would lay down next to the bench she was sleeping to get it. Food could come later, once her muscles weren't screaming in fatigue.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The healers were naturally the ones in charge of comfort for everyone. So, one came over with a less fatigued soldier and directed Ellesandra to one of the tents that was set up with bedrolls, and had the other soldier carry Star along to something more comfy than a log. Thanks were given to both of them for their efforts along with a deep bow from the healer, allowing the two to rest through the night. Food could come in the morning, more than likely, as fatigue remained the most pressing issue. A communal effort was made to ensure everyone was taken care of, with the remainder of the night being just idle tasks before everyone went to bed. The elves did not sleep; they engaged in reverie, often called 'trance', for just four hours. But Star and Ellesandra would likely need a full eight, perhaps ten or twelve before they were able to wake again. But during the night, Ellesandra was visited again. The scenery was different this time. They were on the pirate ship's deck this time, out in the middle of the ocean. Water in all directions, moonlight sky above, sails fully deployed and riding the wind across the black waves. No other beings on the deck of the ship. Just Ellesandra, and the shadowy black creature. They had no eyes, yet Ellesandra somehow knew the creature was looking at them. They were about ten feet apart. Ellesandra had their rapier and armor, and didn't feel any of the injuries of their waking self. They were lucid, aware of their dream. The shadow figure did not exude malice or a desire to fight, but there was certainly also a sense that fighting this creature was a bad idea, at least in this dreamscape where they seemed to hold all the power. "...Why, Ellesandra?" asked the voice which continued to deny any understanding about its nature. "Why did you not run?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected that offer. When laying down and the healer offering them to go to the tent, Ellesandra looked at Star in concern. That was quickly answered as one of the other elves moved to carry Star. She felt concern for Star for a moment until she saw Star laid down in the bedroll safe, and then moved to lay nearby. She positioned herself so that she'd be between Star and anyone that would be approaching; not that it would matter, with how deep into sleep she fell. Normally Ellesandra had trained herself to sleep lightly, to wake up at any strange noises and such, but when she was this exhausted and her body so weak after the haste spell, she always slept deeply. It was one reason she hadn't felt entirely comfortable with sleeping in the inn, compared to with the elves. The elves, she at least was allied with and kind of trusted to keep an eye out. Random people in an Inn who might hold a grudge, whether or not they were magicked? Definitely not. When she dreamt again, of the shadowy black creature, Ellesandra immediately reached for her weapon. Even if it wasn't looking hostile, it had been hostile - and Ellesandra was taking up a defensive posture. "Why are you still in my dreams? Is it the gem?" She had worried that the creature might be in the gem. Had sleeping with it in her pocket been a mistake? Either way, she didn't answer it's question. Instead she stayed in the defensive, concern and caution filling her emotions, eyes flicking this way and that to see if anything else was around.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The dreamscape was still just a ship. No other persons. No threats. Not even any waves to speak of. The waters were unnaturally still as the ship sailed through them. The shadowy figure did not react to the defensive posture. "The gem lost its influence when you shattered it. But it also a...Lesser gem," the shadow explained, strangely helpful. "It poses you no harm, now. Though perhaps some magic lingers within it to be discovered. Now I ask, again...Why did you not run? I have shown you that the only thing that awaits you is pain."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was a little surprised at how the shadow just...answered her. A frown creased her face and her right hand reached for her pocket, where the gem had been. Magic still in it? It would need to be examined by someone with more skill in identifying that type of thing; she didn't trust it otherwise. She definitely wasn't just going to take this shadow's word for it. "I'm not going to play your games or answer your questions just because you show up in my dream. After what I saw you encouraging be done with those pirates and in that town, I've no requirement to answer anything." Stubborn she was, not always the most intelligent though.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "If I wanted to force you to answer, force you to bend to me, I would have little trouble. I would think you'd consider not joining the fate of that pirate captain you slayed a mercy. Not that I expect you to take my mercy as a signal that I am your ally. But that I am not your ally does not necessarily mean I am your enemy. I hope at least you can recognize that drawing your blade has no purpose here." With those words, Ellesandra's rapier drew itself and flung across the ship, embedding in the deck far behind the shadow. It then exploded into flowers. This was, after all, a dream. Just not one that Ellesadnra was in control of. "I'm not here to play games. I'm here to talk. But if you'd rather be stubborn and resist, there's no reason I need be civil. The choice is yours, Ellesandra."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra reached for her rapier even as it shot across the ship and into the deck, then turned into....flowers? She blinked a few times in confusion before turning to look back at the shadow. Well, if it was trying to show it had control here, it did. She considered trying to pinch herself to force herself to wake up, but not only did she doubt that would work, it seemed childish. Instead, she took a step back, creating more distance between her and the creature, then crossed her arms tightly. "Fine. We trade questions then. I ask first, then you. Why are you haunting, or visiting or whatever you would call this, Star's guardians?" Obviously there was nothing forcing the creature to answer, but she was hoping that it would accept the back and forth rather than just asking Ellesandra a bunch of questions. It would put them on as close to even ground as Ellesandra might be able to wrangle in this space.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"I certainly wouldn't call it haunting, but you can call it whatever you like. And it is not just Star. But she is certainly one of the persons of interest, yes. The reason for it? Well. It is quite a story to explain in full. The overwhelming majority of it does not concern you. But the part that does? I hope you won't consider the answer insufficient as I tell you that it is...Not as much about Star herself as it is what Star is trying to do. If she, like you, were to abandon the cause and leave, then you would never see me again. I have little hope that you, or I, would ever dissuade her from abandoning her cause. I have succeeded in manufacturing the circumstances to ensure Nina is no longer acting in protection of Star. And you'll forgive me for hoping that my previous entry into your dream, showing you what awaits Star, and showing you that I am all too aware of your past with Marigold, along with the leverage that provides me, would have been enough to make you act rationally, and leave. She will pursue her goal without you, but she will not be able to achieve it alone. She might even live to an old age." The shadow then paused to allow them to take in the information. "So again...I ask...Why did you not run?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched the creature, considering. Was it...trying to protect Star? Though it's mention of Marigold sent anger through her, not only at the memory of the previous dream but also at the irritation and pain that the memory brought. And that not only star, but this damn creature could just apparently see right through her. She was tired of not having her normal barriers work. Shifting to let out some of the irritated energy, she shook her head. "Rationally? You pretend you know anything about Marigold, to have her name in your mouth. If you did, you would have known that showing her dying to me, and implying the same would happen if Star continued alone, would only encourage me to stay with her and protect her from that fate." The words were not verbalized, but in her mind she heard them. 'like I couldn't protect Marigold'. She wanted to do it right, this time. She could not let another charge die. If she walked away now, and Star died on her journey, Ellesandra would be at fault - or at least, she would feel like she was at fault.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Really? Because the way I see it, you've done nothing but agonize over your failure. Nothing but insult and push away everyone around you. I saw fit only to give you a gentle shove over the edge and have you see the truth. The pirate captain you faced was a peon. The thralls that serve me could run you through in an instant, ending your life before you ever realized you were under threat. And I say that not as a threat. I say that simply to illustrate to you that the path you walk is one that spells your doom. I would truly prefer that you and Star do live. I mean that. But you meddle in things beyond the scope of your existence. You walk forward to mutual peril. You have encountered me only by chance, and you owe nothing to Star. You won't be able to save her from me if you press onwards to Myst, and then her homeland. While Myst will be a safe place for you, the lands beyond will not be. Gurhal will be your grave." The shadow paused again, once more giving information away. "You are welcome to ask another question, if you are prepared to answer another in turn."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Lips pressed together in a firm line, displeased with what he was saying. It wasn't entirely inaccurate, though she didn't go out of her way to insult people like he implied. Push them away surely, but she mostly did that by just being guarded. Unfortunately, that didn't seem to work with Star. At the promise of how dangerous continuing this path was, she just shook her head. "Again, all you're doing is assuring me that either I stay with Star and convince her not to follow this path, or stay with her to protect her from this mutual peril that we'd both be in. Not doing a good job of convincing me otherwise." She relaxed her crossed arms, only to reach up and scratch at the back of her head when considering another question. Did she have another one, that was worth answering one of its? The creature seemed to be pretty powerful, and already knew about Marigold, so what did she have to hide. "Beyond convincing Star not to follow this path - because we both know that's about as likely as myself becoming as emotional as Star and sharing them with the world - How can I best protect her from you and these perils she faces?" Might as well get straight to the heart of the matter, right? No need to beat around the bush.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"There's no reason to kill Star if she has no guardian to get in the way. Conflict will keep her away, and she will find it at very corner where she walks without you. She will run, perhaps forever, while being infinitely redirected by me. I can't guarantee she will survive, but I can promise I won't be the one to fell her if you leave," said the creature, difficult to determine if it was indifference or some other thing in its warbled tone. The emotion was impossible to discern. "As to your question? You can best protect her by leaving. But to ensure I stay true to the spirit of your question, I will provide another answer." Was the figure lying, or just trying to dissuade Ellesandra further? Could they trust the figure? It was giving a warning where it at least claimed it could end them in an instant, but was holding back. Was that also a bluff? If something stronger than the pirate was sent to Ellesandra and was equally able to take knives to its brain, perhaps it wasn't. But it had made its desires clear. It had every reason to try and get Ellesandra to leave, and little reason to encourage them to stay. "You will not defeat my thralls in combat. You are too mortal. Strong as you are, you are too weak. You have lived but twenty four years. Barely cresting adulthood. My greater thralls, the bearer of the Blood Onyx, the Red Opal, the Blood Emerald." As they spoke, the thralls in question appeared behind them. They each looked at Ellesandra with indifference, though their forms were shadow, like the primary shadow. Each one had a gemstone embedded in their heart, like the captain had. An onyx, an opal, and an emerald, each one tinted red and dripping with blood. Unlike the main shadow, they each had a set of eyes. The first two red, 'emerald' one green eyes. The eyes were solid colours and glowing. "You will not defeat them in battle. And since that is all you know, you will be powerless against them. And if it comes to it, they will take Star by force. Before I ask my question...Does that sufficiently answer yours?"
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked between each of the creatures that the shadow was 'showing' her, trying to take in any details about them she could. Obviously there was very little information, but even just a generic outline might help her recognize one of them in the wild before they started attacking, assuming she couldn't identify the feeling of the shadow ahead of time. It was odd that she'd been able to feel it from the boat, but she didn't want to ask about that or give that information away, unsure if it knew that she could sense it. "Lovely to know your absolute confidence, thank you for that." They weren't going to pretend the 'leaving Star' wasn't a consideration, but it was one she could consider when she was awake, not when she was conversing with this shadow being for now. "If I were a technical person, your question was just asked by confirming it sufficiently answered mine. But I'll play fair and honorable, as Torm would have me do. Yes, that sufficiently answers my question."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You'll find that playing games with me will end poorly for you all the same," said the shadow, still once more with emotions unable to be discerned. "Very well. Then my next question is thus: Why do you believe Star is connected to you? Auramancers have supreme control over their auras. Or at least...A master auramancer does. It should not be that touch alone bridges the connection between you both. Or is it not that you do not think about it, simply that you do not care to consider it? That her ability to see through your careful stoic face bothers you too much to bother with such idle curiosities?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned. So this being obviously knew Star was an auramancer, which was apparently something most people didn't know about. Was it a deity of some kind? Or perhaps just a really powerful demon? She wouldn't be surprised if it was just a deity fucking around in mortal's lives, and huffed silently. "I have no idea why, she mentioned that and it bothers the hell out of me. I'd rather her not be able to see shit. I'm not aware of any connection between the two of us, beyond maybe you appearing in my damn dreams." She paused, tilting her head one way then the other. She never fully looked away from the shadow, keeping it in her sight, but she did look to the side while considering. "Perhaps when she first used magic when I first approached her, and I absorbed some of her energy through my own ability, that bridged it? Because I have some of her energy in me, her auramancy reads it like she's reaching out to something similar, or acts as the bridge for her?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The shadow didn't react to the answer given. "A worthy theory. But her auramantic magic bypasses your absorption. Her more typical mana, that she can use to cast spells more familiar to the typical caster, you have absorbed. But it connects her to you no more or less than it has connected you to every other source of mana that you have absorbed." The shadow then paused. "I remain honourable in my methods. So I will further extend the spirit of the question and ask: Do you wish to knew the truth of this matter? And if so, do you wish for me to explain it, or do you wish to ask Star, knowing she might not know, or might lie? Though I suppose...If you do not leave Star, you will be seeing me again, and may wish to explore one option before the other."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	"What is the purpose of sending me to ask Star only to expect me to ask you again afterwards? If you know the answer and are willing to share, why not just share it rather than ask these silly questions? I care not where the answer comes from, other than knowing I distrust you more than I distrust Star." Which was actually saying something, since while she trusted Star to speak the truth most of the time, she did not trust how her magic worked. It was less about trust in Star and more a dislike to how vulnerable and open she felt against her magic, how she had no control over a firm emotional boundary that she usually drew for everyone to stay away from.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You'll find that I don't ask needless questions. Even if you might not understand the reason initially, it has its purpose. In this case, consider that the answer I have to share may have its consequence. That learning this from me may deprive you of the chance to ask Star instead. You say you care not where the answer comes from, but perhaps you should consider if that is wise. I am not your ally. My words may sow doubt in you. I have proven that I know things most do not. That I know at all what Auramancy is alone proves as much. Yet I know so much more. Things I should not know, in the opinions of many. So it then becomes a question you must ask yourself: Where is your anchor? Unto which pillars of truth do you sow your foundations? Plausibility? Contextual validity? Faith in the source? I present to you the problem you now face, since you are so eager to rush forward without due consideration of it: You may ask Star, and Star alone. I will tell you that Star knows not the full answer. Only the surface of the truth. She will tell you the root cause. She will tell you what her mother told her. She will tell you, perhaps even show you, what causes the two of you specifically to be connected in that way. She may even be able to tell you how rare it is that this phenomenon occurs with others. What she cannot tell you, what she does not know, is why you and her now stand together. And that, Ellesandra...Will prove to be unpalatable knowledge for you, I believe. Knowledge I am happy to provide...For I believe there is a chance it will further my ends, and give you greater cause to depart from Star, and abandon her mission. Knowledge I can assure you is the truth, regardless of how vehemently you choose to doubt it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shook her head. "If the answer is true, then I care not it's source in this moment. Should the answer be something I feel Star should have told me, then that's a conversation I will have with her. Assuming I believe you and you aren't phrasing things in a way to intentionally antagonize me against her, which I'll decide if you are after I heart this. So, stop talking in riddles and answer it." Ellesandra seemed a little impatient and annoyed with the shadow. She didn't like how this creature could apparently just appear in her dreams at will, how much power it might have and that it seemed intent on stopping Star from finishing her mission. Her arms crossed again, glancing around as if seeking a way to escape this conversation or dream. Maybe pinching herself wasn't such a bad idea, after all? Would that wake her though, or just reinforce that this was a dream? She wasn't sure; dream magic was something she wasn't aware of, if this even was dream magic.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "They are hardly riddles, Ellesandra. You are still young, still cresting over your passage into adulthood. One day, you will need to face the reality of the grand multiverse around you, and your place in it. Or don't. You're welcome to remain ignorant. But as for the answer...You and Star have what auramancers call 'resonance'. Auras are a strange and mysterious thing, and there are many points where words will fail to adequately explain them. This is one such time, but...Simply think of it like music. Two harmonies that compliment one another perfectly and sound...Right. Auramancers slowly come to achieve resonance with other people over time, if they remain close, and the bond between them grows strong enough. Though, I speak of this as if there are thousands of auramancers from which to draw such conclusions. No. Their bloodline has been ongoing for but a few short centuries, and what other bloodlines of auramancers I have known have all died. But I digress. This resonance is rare to exist naturally. Extremely so. Perhaps it is just chance, perhaps there is some other quality that creates it. I truly cannot say." A first for the shadow, it seemed. "But the resonance of your auras is something that would typically require a very....Specific emotion to achieve. And even then, it is not guaranteed. That is why Star struggles to control her powers in how they affect you. That she could see your emotions would always be true, but what happens when you touch is where this resonance matters. Which leads me to...The part that Star does not know. The why of it all. The truth of why you were on the road you were on at the exact moment you needed to be. Perhaps you just through it a coincidence. But I'm sure my talking about it clues you into how it was anything but." The shadow stopped here, raising an arm towards Ellesandra. A shimmering light appeared beside Ellesandra. Another figure, this one a coalescence of white light taking the form of a humanoid. Around this figure's neck appeared to be hanging a necklace, with a brilliant sapphire pendant. The necklace was ethereal and made of light as well, so it would take some time to study it to discern that it was supposed to be jewelry, and different from the embedded gemstones of the other shadows behind the one who spoke. "...It was my enemy who guided the circumstances. Who meddled in precisely every necessary event to ensure that you and Star crossed paths and met one another under circumstance that would compel your response. Manipulated you into meeting her, with both of you remaining none the wiser to it, so that all would fall into place, and disrupt my ends. And you have said yourself more than once how you do detest the gods and their meddlesome ways...Even if this white figure beside you, nor I, are gods. Had it not been for this influence, you very well might never had met Star. And thus, never would have been caught up in the war they and I fight. So it is my desire only to persuade you to walk away from this manipulation, return the world to its fated ways."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was getting tired of this creature's way of speaking. It was arrogant and seemed to like to hear itself talk, considering how it kept going on and on without getting to the point. The point being, apparently this other creature with a sapphire pendant was the one who brought them together. This shadow creature's enemy? They looked towards this figure, looking them up and down to take in as much detail about them as possible so if it was anything like how the creature actually looked, they would be able to recognize them upon encountering them. Then, turned back to the shadow and shrugged. "Oh lovely some fate designed connection between Star and I that lets her see into me. That isn't her fault, and damn well isn't mine, as much as I hate her being able to see my emotions so easily." She shook her head. "And why would knowing this strange creature orchestrated us together make me less inclined to continue on my path? You're doing the exact same thing, trying to manipulate me into not continuing. Either I continue and do what this other creature wants, or don't and do what you want. Either way, I'm following the plan of some other asshole. Might as well do what I want and say fuck you to anyone else who might benefit or not from it. Right now, my decisions are my own. Now, if I jump over the side of this ship, will the damn dream end?" She was done talking to this creature. Her head hurt - as much as it could hurt in a dream - and she didn't give a damn about what it was saying.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You're welcome to view it as such. But consider that one side manipulated you without your knowledge, and I brought forward my intentions honestly. I am stating my intentions, and providing you forewarning of the consequences of your actions. I relegate the freedom to choose to you in turn." The shadow paused a moment. "The dream will not end if you jump. The dream will end when I permit it. Which I will permit promptly once I offer you one last chance to ask a final question of me if you so wish. It will be a few days before you see me again, I imagine. But time will tell."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waved her hand. "No question, just get me out of here. Your verbose way of speaking is reminding me of the nobility back home and it's giving me a headache." She'd always hated being in meetings with Marigold where she had to listen to the nobles speak down their noses at every little thing, but speak around issues consistently so as to not draw any unwanted or negative attention to themselves. She had frequently just wanted to knock them in the back of the head and tell them to speak normally and tell it to someone straight, but they wouldn't of course and she would never do that. The only one of them that ever spoke to her straight was Marigold, though growing up together certainly helped that. Marigold had learned early in childhood that Ellesandra might tease her for something, but would never hold it against her or over her head. Children made mistakes, and Ellesandra was a ride-or-die friend in keeping those mistakes secret. She looked back at the creature, impatient and waiting. Would she wake from her dream immediately after, or would she still be able to sleep normally? She hoped she didn't wake up screaming or go into a nightmare after this; the creature probably had the power to force that and it would just be plain annoying to do when surrounded by elves and Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Upon the question being passed, the ship faded away to blackness. Their regular dreams were not theirs to have this night; Ellesandra woke, and it was later into morning. They were rested, though the wounds from the night before were certainly still there. Star was still asleep beside Ellesandra. Peaceful, and calm. The gentle sounds of elves moving about outside the tent to tend to morning needs could be heard. It was a calm morning. The dangers of the night prior were gone, now.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra set up quickly, Groaning at the pain that shot through her ribs, she did a quick link glance around to ensure that the shadow wasn't anywhere to be seen, and that they were in the camp as they were when they went to bed. Star was still next to her, and the bustle of the camp in the morning seemed normal. Her muscles still screamed in protest at her movements, still in a state where she would she would need rest to be back to 100% not even considering injuries, but she wasn't going to fall over from fatigue at least. For a moment, she watched Star sleeping to ensure she wasn't having a similarly bad dream. With a grunt, she pushed off of the ground and stood up, stretching and popping multiple bones along the way. Her entire body was still sore, but pain was mostly focused to her rib and thigh. Her arm was a minor ache, where apparently the shrapnel hadn't gone in enough to be a major wound. With her stomach growling loudly, she made her way over to wherever they were serving food. She considered cooking her own out of their stock, but that would just be wasteful in supplies and also might offend their hosts. She took some time to ensure the camp was in order and nothing happened overnight, before bringing two servings of the breakfast back to Star and sitting down next to where she lay. She stretched her leg out so weight wasn't put on the injured thigh and reached out, lightly placing a hand on Stars shoulder and giving her a gentle shake, emotional guard firmly in place to limit any emotional sharing. "Star, you need to get some food in you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The bustle was normal. The air was normal. The shadow was nowhere to be seen or felt. It was just another, normal day. Star looked calm, not at all like a nightmare plagued her. When Ellesandra roused her, she slowly stirred and rubbed at one eye as she slowly came to wake. She looked up at Ellesandra and offered a warm, tender, sleepy smile. "Good morning," she said quietly with a sleepy lilt. "Food...Food sounds good, mmnh." That was enough to get Star slowly rising, still clearly lethargic. Her nose was no longer bloody, and the marks of blood on her dress that were definitely there last night were now...Gone. But all that aside, Star took a few minutes to work up to wakefulness. She had a heavy weight dragging her down with every step, but she was...Happy. She was very clearly happy as she went about her morning routine and sat with Ellesandra for them all to enjoy a morning breakfast that was...Of passing quality. Good enough, filling enough, with at least some delightful fiery char on the meats cooked that had a natural, satisfying quality to it, even if there was nothing in the way of spice. It was a good morning.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched as Star roused and began moving about. She was watching for any sign of injury or worse fatigue that would be of concern, but so far she'd seen none. The blood was gone from her nose, which was good. She considered talking about the shadow in her dream, but didn't quite yet. Let both of then enjoy the morning, fully wake up and then discuss the unpleasantness of that visit. And so, Ellesandra sat to eat the camp food. It was obviously not the best, but also not the worst food she'd had. Despite trying to relax and enjoy the food, which her body desperately needed, there was now a constant paranoia. If the shadow creature could possess people like it had the captain and the pirates, they weren't exactly safe just because they were with the elves. She thought of the gem in her pocket, then shook her head and looked around at the rest of the camp. "We should take advantage of what rest we can get now. I'm still unsure how wise it would be to go into town, and I don't think going back to the settlement with the Elves is on our way to Myst, is it?" It had been a while since Ellesandra had looked at a map, and while she knew the general location of places she'd been, she hadn't been to Myst before. Thus, she was going to be relying on Star - or perhaps seeking to purchase a map- for their direction and guiding. Her job was to keep Star safe, whether that be against mundane people or shadow controlled ones.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
 Star was obviously tired. Her marching would not be wise, that much was obvious. Light travel would be okay, but long distances would require more rest before such a journey. Ellesandra's question about Myst had some of the other elves looking at each other and shrugging. Clearly, they'd never heard of it. Star shook her head. "Part of the way there is shared, but the elvish settlement was north-west, and the directions he showed me on the map have us going north-east. There's...Some degree of shared passage. It's closer physically than Cloverport is. Morrun told us we have to find the people who were from Myst. Sort of...Requires someone who knows how to get there, to get there. As I understand from his explanation, it's not just a place we can walk to. It's a plane all its own. We'll be traveling to another plane of existence to get there, and from there doing the same to get to my home, if his theories and understanding of it all prove to be true," said Star as she finished her breakfast. "I agree that we ought to rest. I don't know that town is dangerous right now, but I'm fine resting in the woods for now if you are uneasy about it. Still. We'll make better time and exhaust ourselves less if we can hire a coach in town."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star, glancing at the nearby elves who seemed confused, then sighed and grumbled. "Have to know someone? I hate knowing people. Means you have to talk to them." The comment was mostly made in jest, trying to inject humor into the camp and Star, even if it wasn't entirely false. Ellesandra was an introvert through and through; guarded because of her trauma and not willing to open up to anyone. Talking to people led to friendships which led to expectation of opening up. So in a way, she was being entirely truthful with the comment. Finishing up her food, she wiped her hands to get rid of the crumbs that might have lasted on her fingers or any of the meat juices, then moved to stand and stretch again. Her muscles ached and she winced, imagining marching back to the elven settlement feeling like this. Even if she could make it, she was almost certain Star wouldn't. "Okay, we can try town. I'll be sure to sleep lightly tonight and we'll see if we can get a room with two beds, so we can be in the same room should anyone try to sneak in." Getting a room at the inn would potentially put a target on them, but it was probably less dangerous than camping in the woods alone. There was no telling if someone might go on a hunt for any stragglers of the army, or looters for anything left behind. Even if the Pirates wouldn't hold a grudge, Ellesandra was not fully betting on that. "Do you think you can make the hike down to the Inn, though? Or should we set up some place nearby to rest more?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star giggled at her companions response. "I'm fine with doing the talking, though you shouldn't sell yourself short. You're plenty likable, whether you like it or not," she said with amusement and affection in equal measure. She wouldn't turn down a chance to be kind to Ellesandra. "I can manage getting into town, it's not that far. I'm not entirely disabled, just want to take it easy today is all. I'm ready to head out when you are."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't quite know how to take the compliment. A huff was all that came out, but there was definitely a stirring of something in her chest. She couldn't identify it - or more like didn't want to identify it - but it was definitely something akin to the way a school girl blushed when given a compliment and her stomach got butterflies. Focusing instead on their plan for the day, Ellesandra grabbed her pack and slung it over her good shoulder, looking down to check to ensure her thigh or arm didn't need rebandaging. The shrapnel hadn't gone so far in that it had bled overnight; it probably had already clotted and was in the process of healing, but she didn't want to replace the bandages quite yet. Walking might reopen the one on her thigh, and she could deal with that when they got to town. "I wasn't claiming you were disabled, I just wanted to ensure that if you needed rest still, you knew we had options. You pushing yourself to the point of collapse can not be a consistent thing. I've known you for just under three full days now and two of those days have come with you doing something reckless that made you fatigued." Granted, those same two days had seen Ellesandra get injured too, but she wasn't about to admit that - or how fatigued she was. She could certainly do a hike to town, but a hike to the elven settlement would have been pushing it for herself as well. "Do we need to report to - actually. Can you point me to any of the magic users here? I'd like to see if they could help check out the gem that was in the Captain's heart before we leave, to ensure it isn't cursed or going to explode on me or anything."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled at the bashful huff. Star hadn't lost her ability to see emotion overnight, so it got her smiling a big, dopey smile for it. She said nothing, however. She just let them huff and save face. On the matter of Star pushing herself to the limit, she pouted playfully. "When we stop getting into life or death situations, I'll stop pushing with all I've got, how's that sound?" she asked with a playful smile. And then, when asked for Star to point out the magic users, she just...Raised a brow and pointed to herself.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra huffed again at the life or death situation comment. "Well if someone wasn't such a meddler, we wouldn't have been in either of those situations." That was probably inaccurate, and Ellesandra wasn't actually upset at Star for meddling. In reality, she would have wanted to do the same had she been on her own, but if she were on her own things probably would have ended very poorly for her. Her hand moved up to her throat and touched the sensitive bruising that was there still, wincing at the thought, then looking back to Star when she pointed to herself regarding the magic user. Rolling her eyes, Ellesandra shook her head and dropped her voice to a whisper. "Considering the shadow demon thing came OUT of this gem and seems hell bent on ensuring you do not continue with your goal of finding your mother, I do not want you touching it at all. There's no telling what kind of trap or curse it might put on you if you do." Hell, she wasn't entirely comfortable carrying it around herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star squinted playfully at Ellesandra, flashing a knowing smile. She had every belief that the knight would not be able to walk away from another in need, just as they hadn't with her. She then sighed through her nose at Ellesandra's worries, at least agreeing that they were valid it seemed as she pointed to the circle of three other elves who were finishing their breakfast. Robed elves who were part of the group of healers. "If you insist, talk to them. But I don't really sense any malicious presence from it. Or much of any magic, though I'm sure it might be different if I held it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pretending not to notice the squint or smile. Instead, she shook her head. "Oh yeah, I'm sure it might be different if you held it. It might possess you and turn you into a creature who doesn't die when I stab him in the head." She paused, then corrected. "Her, in your case." Okay, maybe she was just a little salty about how the pirate didn't die like he should have. She needed to adjust how she planned to fight any other creature she sensed the shadow in, going forward. Hopefully it wouldn't be any creatures, but she doubted that was likely if she continued with Star. Instead of continuing on about that, though, she followed Star's point to one of the robed elves and approached, waving awkwardly to get their attention as she did. "Good morning-" Her voice was stilted, awkward, randomly talking to a stranger to make a request which might endanger them. She honestly didn't want to, but felt like she needed to. "I was wondering - when I killed the captain yesterday, he didn't die normally. Had to stab him through the heart despite stabbing him in the head, and apparently he was being kept alive by this gem..." She reached into her pocket, ensuring skin didn't contact that gem when she pulled it out. "And I was led to believe it might still have a few traces of magic in it. I was wondering if one of you could help check to see what kind of magic, if it's cursed or needs to be destroyed somehow?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded, though she could tell that the knight was bothered by the outcome of fight. Or what it took to get there at least. She could hardly blame them. "I thought for sure you had him. I was relived. But then, when it wasn't the end, well...That's when I lost it, sorta. I'm...Still trying to figure out where that all came from." She gave a soft smile, assuring she was fine, at least would be until Ellesandra came back from the others. The elves in question smiled at Ellesandra, hearing their request. One of them held their hand out to take the gem. When they took it, the elf focused on the gem for a moment. They lightly glowed with mana. A bit of time passed. When they finished, they held the gem back out to Ellesandra. "There was some sort of enchantment on this gemstone. Only broken echoes remain. I could not tell you the purpose, other than it was quite powerful to still have such a presence when broken like this. That said...The spell is broken. It has no effects now that I can detect. Only a malevolent whisper that is fading slowly. I imagine it will lose its power in a few days, possibly crumbling to nothingness from there. If it was within the pirate, then it certainly explains what gave him such power. But with it being so broken, the finer details of what it was supposed to do are lost."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. They would talk about Star's magic use later; when they were alone. While the mage was examining the stone, Ellesandra was patient. She watched the stone carefully, to ensure that the process of identifying it didn't cause any types of chain reaction or something, but eventually she was told that it was turning to a normal stone - maybe even would crumble away into dust. She pursed her lips, looking down at the gem and taking it back when it was offered. A brief though of just tossing it away into the woods with all her strength crossed her mind briefly, but she instead pocketed it again with a nod. "Thanks for the confirmation." If it still had whispers of malevolence, it was possible for someone to randomly stumble upon it and maybe unintentionally empower it again, right? She wouldn't take the chance of throwing it away only for it to harm someone else. She'd let it crumble away in her pocket, instead. With a nod to the healers, she headed back to Star, nodding. "Okay, we should be good to head out. The gem apparently is of no immediate danger, and might fall apart on it's own in a bit of time. Until then, I don't really want a stranger to stumble upon it, so I'll carry it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to Ellesandra. "That is a wise choice I think. Even if it's harmless now, no reason to not be cautious and handle it with care until it's gone," she said, working up to her feet. Being good to head out, Star set about towards the city. Her pace was slow. Cautious to not rush either of them. There was time to chat along the way, though silence wouldn't be broken by Star. Just some smiles now and then. Even in the wake of battle, so long as evil did not win, it seemed there was no shaking Star's pleasant spirit.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star move to stand, taking up that protective stance close to her in case she needed assistance. They had both worn themselves out the day before; Star probably more so. Ellesandra's fatigue was muscle weariness, but she'd gone through this plenty of times when forced to use her haste magic like that. She would be sore and feeling it the entire walk back, but she wasn't about to collapse. Star, however, had magically exhausted herself - again. After having done so just recently, Ellesandra was worried about her stamina and ability to make this trek. Still, she didn't say anything as they collected their things and began the hike down to the town, staying close enough to reach out and take an arm or help steady Star if needed. She didn't speak, not really having much to say in her normal no-small-talk way, and also wanting to ensure that they could focus on their trip and not get distracted or fall due to it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star managed to keep steady. She wouldn't turn down Ellesandra's arm if offered, but it was taken with a tenuous grasp. Her ability to maintain the emotional wall in tandem with the knight was a little fragile. A steady stream of connected emotions, echoes of the other person, would bleed through while connected. So if the desire was to hold on anyway, there would be plenty of Star's serene, pleasant happiness to feel bleeding through the connection, muted and muffled by the attempts to solidify the barrier between them, as well as an ever-present concern for the other woman. Regardless, the walk proved uneventful and the people in town were working with some of the elvish soldiers to clean up the mess. The bombs had left scorched stone in some places, broken patches of stone in others, some minor property destruction to be found, and plenty of mopping to deal with the spatters of blood. Among the people were what appeared to be city guardsman, who hadn't been too great in number before the war, but seemed to be far more numerous now. Where did they all come from? Where were they when the city needed them? Questions remained unanswered for the moment. But nobody seemed hostile, either. Rather, the people seemed cordial. Thankful. There'd be no resistance to walking into the inn to book a room for the night, as if nothing even happened. There was some lingering fear on the faces of the people but...More than anything, relief.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked around, both on guard and cautious, but also feeling for the citizens. While they obviously looked relieved to have the pirates gone and no longer be under their spell or rule, there had obviously been damage and likely deaths. She kept a special eye on the city guard she saw; it was entirely possible they had been under some sort of magic just like the pirates had been, but it was also possible they'd simply been paid off, so until anything was clear Ellesandra was going to be on guard. She stayed closer to Star than normal, just far enough away she could avoid touching Star unless necessary, to make it clear that they were together and Star was under her protection. When they got to the Inn, she would first go about requesting a room for the night and more food. It wasn't that it was that long since they'd begun their trek that morning and eaten breakfast, but they both needed to rejuvenate a lot of energy - be it physical or magical - and food would help with this. She didn't go straight up to their room, but would indicate Star find a table to sit at and join her after ordering food -extra fruits and veggies for Star - and some water, and leaning against the table across from her. "We should talk about the shadow. I had another dream last night. Ellesandra kept her voice low, but felt no need to hide this from Star. If anything, Star deserved to know what she was potentially up against, on this journey.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was certainly feeling for the people as well. Perhaps better than anyone else could. No immediate signs of civilian deaths could be observed, but it's possible the dead had all been carted away already to be buried. It certainly put a damper on Star's smile, though she sought solace in the fact that their actions were simply dousing an infected wound with medicine. Pain felt now to save greater pain later. There was only so much that could comfort her, of course. Being given an extra helping of her preferred food from her knightly companion, a small showing of thoughtfulness, did bring her spirits up a little once more, however. It wasn't the food that made her smile, but rather that her companion noticed and remembered such things. They could hide behind the guise of duty all day, but Star had an advantage in her sight that made such lies even more flimsy than they were on the surface. She was clearly still hungry as she began into her food, though politely paused when acknowledging the other's words. "Is that so?" she asked with a troubled tone, kept low all the same. They had a booth together that would allow them to keep their discussion private enough, so long as they were mindful with their volume. "Please...Do tell."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked down at her own plate, spearing a piece of an egg and chewing it slowly while considering how to approach this topic. She probably should have considered that more on the walk here, or even explained it on the walk, but she had wanted to look into Star's eyes while explaining it. To see how Star reacted to some of the news, or if Star had intentionally been hiding the resonance bit from her for some reason. She chewed slowly while considering before looking up to her. "Well, there was a lot discussed. In summary, you and I share a 'resonance' which is apparently the connection between your magic and why it's so easy for you to interact with my emotions. Not a fan of that, by the way." That probably didn't need to be said; Star fully well knew by now that Ellesandra was a very private person about her thoughts and emotions and found it invasive that Star could just see that naturally. "And that the enemy of this shadow creature, unnamed, is what organized us coming together. The shadow creature orchestrated all of this, and has multiple other servants like the captain being controlled by some gem like thing. And they're set against you reaching your destination; claiming that if I go with you it will empower you to continue rather than giving up and lead to both of our deaths." She paused, trying to think if there was anything else she'd missed in that very high level summary. "And encouraging me to abandon you because you won't be as likely to get close, and thus die, to your destination. Oh, and that if you made it to Myst you'd die. So, we're on the right track, at least." She began to reach for the water, then paused. "And I think they confirmed that they were the influence that took your previous guardian from you. Unclear, by that point I was getting a headache at it's damn political talk of walking around a point."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star wore a little pout when Ellesandra made a point of how they weren't a fan. A face that spoke of how she wasn't really able to control it. "It's not normal for me, either," she said quietly, still pouting a bit. "But...Are you sure? I've...Never been fully resonant with someone before," she said, which then prompted her to blush. "...A-Are you...Sure that is the word the shadow used?" she asked, with her embarrassment to the fact alluding to there being more to it than the shadow had told. She had to ponder the other parts. The enemy of the shadow got them together? Was that a good thing? It was a lot to take in. But the overall message was clearly one of trying to dissuade the pair from continuing. "Mmnh....And, well. I won't stop. But I also hope you know that you're not...Bound to me. Forced to be here, or anything. N-Not that I...Want you to go, or anything. Quite the opposite. But given how much has happened in just the few days you've known me I wouldn't blame you now or ever if you decided your path went elsewhere. Not...Advocating for it. Just making sure you know that I care about you and your choice in the matter, whatever it may be. So long as it's your true feelings."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned at Star's reaction to the word resonant. The blush made her tilt her head, eyes narrowing curiously and observing what she could of the mage before her. "Yes, I'm pretty sure it used the word resonance. Explained that it's some musical harmony between aura's or something." A brief wave of her hand. She hadn't fully understood what it was talking about. "And how it usually builds over time from some sort of emotion, I'm assuming a loyalty or bond or love or something like that. And that for it to have been a natural, immediate occurrence for us was rare, which is honestly just a little more annoying." She paused after saying this, guilt creeping in again. She knew this wasn't Star's fault, and didn't want her to constantly feel bad about something she could control. Picking up a piece of bacon, she chewed on it and leaned back into her seat, glancing around the Inn for a generic perusal and ensuring they hadn't drawn any unwelcome attention so far. "I'm not leaving, and while it seems like you stopping your journey would be the best thing for your safety, I both don't believe you will and also refuse to give into the obvious manipulations of some sort of higher power. Confirmed not deity, at least by it's own mouth, but still some sort of higher asshole being." Ellesandra obviously didn't like being directed by any form of 'fate' or manipulated by those who thought they were simply beyond mortal.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile. "Then we're agreed that I was already going to do all of this, but someone telling me not to is just going to make me do it even harder," she said, her smile growing playful. A little light-heartedness, for the daunting task grew ever more daunting with the knowledge of such an enemy that would see them fail. She paused to bite into the apple she had and thoughtfully chew it before circling back. "...What they said about resonance is true, at least insofar as what my mother told me. My two mothers had resonance with one another, though it was not immediate. Auras grow more naturally attuned to each other in time, with longer exposure. At some point you'll be able to see my natural aura to some degree, though without my gift it might not make much sense. Colourful, if nothing else. I don't want to bore you with the ins and outs of it all. But when we first met I'm sure you noticed how I stared at you for so long. I've never felt a connection to another's aura like this before, and I've been trying to figure it out. I...Hadn't assumed it was full resonance; like you were told, it's exceptionally rare. Enough that in all my travels you're the first." Lucky them. If anything, Star assumed Ellesandra found it to be more of a curse than a blessing. "...But without taking the time for us to expose our auras together, resonance does little beyond act as a strong...Compatibility. Musical harmony is a decent way to think of it I guess. It's the first time I've had to actively separate our auras as they try to mingle when we touch, like I said. But...Resonance..." Once more, there was some allusion to potential benefits to be gained from this quality, though Star seemed to assume Ellesandra wanted nothing to do with any of it. Or maybe just didn't want to babble magical words at them over second breakfast.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't actually noticed how Star had stared at her, not really. She'd just thought the staring was hoping that Ellesandra would help her, trying to plead with her silently or something. The intense stare hadn't been out of the normal, and as they'd walked to town she'd figured Star was just seeing her emotions, once that became a thing that Ellesandra knew Star could do. Ellesandra did have a lot of them, even if they were repressed, so it hadn't been abnormal for her. The idea of her being Star's first, in regards to this resonance thing, was just her damn luck. Or, this strange other figure who had orchestrated them together. She hadn't forgotten about that, and though it irritated her she didn't really have a purpose of just stewing in said irritation. "Well, I'm not a musician, so I'm not about to be making any kind of aura harmony with you intentionally." A joke, to try to lighten the mood a little. And get them off such a serious topic in which Ellesandra was feeling both distaste for how invasive Star's power was, and also guilty at that feeling because she knew it wasn't something Star was choosing to do. She didn't hold it against Star, per say, but it still made her even more cautious and guarded around her than she might be - and that was a little unfair. She finished off the last of her plate and slid it to the side, taking a longer drink of water and gazing out into the Inn again. "I'm getting the sense your magic would be stronger if I let this resonance or whatever work, but I'm not going to just let you in. I'm not okay with that. So I'm drawing a firm boundary here, okay?" She didn't look at Star as she said this, unsure what refusing that might mean for Star - or even she even could control this at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "There's a reason I didn't bring up all the ways it could be beneficial to our adventures. You don't need to redraw boundaries that you've already drawn," she said with a voice that was two parts respectful to one part...Sad. Perhaps disappointed. But there was resignation which joined her tone, an acceptance despite her own desires for the state of affairs. She looked at the last remnants of her food, moving a finger to roll a lone blueberry that she was saving for last around on her plate in little circles. She didn't look at Ellesandra either as she continued to speak. "I'm doing what I can to keep the boundary firm between us...I just need you to know that anything that might spill through that isn't intentional. I'm a little out of my depth with you. But it...At the very least allows my sympathetic healing to be most effective on you, and effortlessly performed, should we need to leverage it. Should you permit it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt - was it pain? No, it wasn't quite pain, but the guilt and feeling bad about causing that sadness in Star was so similar to the guilt and pain combination she felt for Marigold that she felt it like that. Her jaw clenched, knowing that this boundary was something Star might not like or understand. Star was too willing and open to share things, and Ellesandra the exact opposite. How their 'auras' could have any form of harmony with how different they were was beyond the knight. She snorted at the sympathetic healing bit, mumbling - "Great, an easier way for my mistakes to cause someone else pain." She didn't refuse it, though. Star had a good point that, in the moment, it might be absolutely necessary. And if it were, Ellesandra would accept it - but ONLY if she agreed it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise, she was going to keep that rule of it not happening firmly in place. "So, next steps. Go find someone who has come from Myst and encourage them to lead us back there, somehow." Her arms crossed and she finally turned fully to look at Star again. "I think we should stay here at least two days before we start on that, assuming the place continues to be hospitable. We both need that rest, and we'll reassess the second day on if we need to stay longer to recover or are fine to head out afterwards. Does that sound like a plan?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There wasn't enough ambient noise to drown out Ellesandra's mumbling. It was likely intended to just vent internal frustrations, but the comment...It struck Star deep. A mix of sorrow and anger swirled in her, leaving her uncharacteristically silent and focused on her plate as Ellesandra got down to business. Normally quite attentive and chipper, the empath looked like someone sucked the wind out of her sails in the moment. Enough that when the knight asked if it sounded like a plan, they earned only a set of three small nods from Star as she continued to circle that blueberry around on her plate under the pad of her index finger.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She noticed star staring at her plate, but she'd been staring it for a while so Ellesandra hadn't thought anything of it. It wasn't until Star gave just a few small nods that Ellesandra stopped and examined Star closer. Guilt rose again, gnawing at her. But what the hell was she guilty of? For having a boundary? Anger swirled among it, that her having boundaries was harder on Star, that Star could so easily feel and unintentionally slip past those boundaries. She reigned it in though, knowing that being angry at Star wasn't right, and it would just later make her feel even more guilty for how Star would likely react to it. She was the type you had to treat with a very gentle hand, sensitive in more ways than one but willing to be stubborn and stand up against you. Ellesandra sighed, rubbing at her right shoulder and the scar beneath her armor and clothes unconsciously. She couldn't even touch it directly due to her armor, but the habit was there. She didn't know how to handle Star and her openness compared to Ellesandra's own closed off behavior, so instead Ellesandra didn't say anything. She would sit there silently, eyeing the last bit of blueberry on Star's plate for a moment before turning her eyes out to look into the Inn and keep watch until Star was ready to chat or go up to their room; because Ellesandra had insisted on a single room with two beds.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star eventually plucked the blueberry and placed it between her lips. She closed her eyes, pensively savouring the tart, sweet berry for a moment. She remained quiet for a while longer. Whatever it was that ate at her was deep in her heart, clearly. "We should go up to the room, let you get out of your armor if you intend on it. I should focus on meditating." Despite stating this, she didn't immediately rise, waiting for Ellesandra to do so and lead the way.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star spoke again, Ellesandra turned to look at her, then nodded. She very much did want to get out of her armor, having slept in it the night before as well. It was never comfortable to do so, and she knew her underclothes were extremely sweaty right now. Moving to stand and grab her bag, she left the plates and everything on the counter for the waitress. She didn't just walk away, standing beside the table and waiting to ensure Star could stand and didn't need help, and then leading them upstairs to the room the innkeep had indicated. A glance was given around to ensure there weren't any watchers or sentient looking shadows nearby, before opening the door and stepping in. A quick sweep was given around the room as well before stepping to the side to let Star enter, and to confirm that the room was indeed a two bed room. If there was one she'd give it to Star, but it would be nice to have one herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star stood silently and moved with the knight. The room was as described. There were no menacing looking shadows. There might have been a moment where it seemed there were monsters under the bed, but upon closer inspection it would be just a dust bunny moving with the wind of the door opening. A small attached room had a shower to enjoy. A bit cramped, but serviceable. A stack of white towels was also supplied to be used as needed. The sheets and bedding were white. Clean. The two beds were comfortable enough. Far better than a bedroll, but otherwise mediocre. Star wordlessly entered when permitted, and helped herself to seat herself on her bed, electing to stare at the floor for a little while. They had two days to burn, now.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the silence like a damn weight. Normally, she was comfortable with silence - enjoyed it, even. But this silence from Star wasn't natural. She didn't know what it was that she'd done that had upset Star, but something obviously had. Was it the comments about boundaries? She wasn't sure, but with the door closed she watched Star for a few moments, just staring at the floor. Aggravation at herself and her inability to comfort a stranger, how awkward she was with people, built up. She didn't say anything, though. Instead she checked the attached shower room for danger, then set about taking her armor off. It was a relatively long process doing it herself, and in her muscle's weakened state causing the soreness to spike when reaching for the straps beneath her arms. It took about ten minutes to be stripped down to her leggings and tight undershirt, both of which were rank and covered in sweat and blood from the battle and then sleeping in them. She moved to her back and pulled out a change of clothes, laying them to the side. Her right shoulder in particular was bothering her, a symptom of the guilt that seemed to creep up when she was feeling particularly bad, and now it being free she reached and lightly massaged at the damaged muscle at the top. She didn't go straight for the shower though, like she wanted to. She wanted to rinse the stink and blood of her wounds away, change her wound dressings and check on her ribs. Instead, she sat on her own bed and motioned with her head for Star to take the first shower. "Yours if you want it first." The first words spoken to her since arriving, the tension of whatever was wrong having been left to build or go away on it's own.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took a look over Ellesandra as they took off their clothes. The offer was enough to lighten her mood a tiny bit, enough to eke out a tiny smile. Thoughtful as always. "I mean this in the absolute most respectful way I can possible say it, Ellesandra...You need it first." She smiled again. "You look like you were suffering under your armor. So please. I think it's best I take time to meditate for a moment anyway." Her tone lowered as she spoke, moving to a bit over a whisper by the end. That was all she seemed to have to say on the matter, then went back to staring at the floor.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't disagree. She knew she stunk right now, but had been used to this before. Still, at the confirmation to do it first Ellesandra had stood. She watched Star seem to disappear into herself again, a frown crossing her face and concern now showing. This wasn't just a little feeling bad, was it? Star was troubled by something, relatively deeply. Ellesandra stood awkwardly for a moment, not knowing how to approach the topic, before she shook her head. Best not to, since she was probably the one who had caused the issue to begin with. Knowing herself, she'd just make it worse. So, Ellesandra turned to the shower. "Don't open the door for anyone until I'm out." The warning came over her shoulder as she was pulling her jerkin off. She didn't have any concerns with modesty, but she did close the door to just a crack. Open enough that she'd easily be able to hear if anything went wrong in the main room, but closed enough that no one would just see her standing nude in there. There was a chance, if Star had looked up and seen her as she was walking in, that Star would have seen the scars across Ellesandra's back. Whip marks for the most part, as well as an ugly scar that was on the back of her right shoulder where some sort of blade had pierced straight through her shoulder. Harder to see was another one further down her right arm, between her elbow and shoulder. And lastly, a thin scar on her left rib where someone had obviously cut deep into it from the side. There was also a noticeable lack of muscle definition on her right side, when compared to that of her left. With her back turned to Star as she entered, it was only briefly - but Ellesandra's lack of modesty or attempting to hide said scars spoke to a likelihood of Star seeming them later on in their travels anyways. She took a quick shower, assuming no interruptions, using the water and a little bit of a lavender scented soap she carried in her pack in a wood box to help with the worst of the stench. She kept the old bandages on her wounds for now, planning to change them out after rather than removing to be stung by the water. She did dry off inside and put on her clothes with the door just cracked before re-entering the bedroom, doing another quick glance around to ensure Star was still there, and safe.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star flicked her eyes at Ellesandra as they moved into the shower. Enough to catch a glimpse, but little more. She sat with the knowledge for a while. Specifically, as long as Ellesandra took to shower. No disturbances came. When the other woman emerged, Star was seated on her bed, the one closer to the wall as she imagined Ellesandra would prefer the one closer to the door for the security of the arrangement, with legs folded and hands in a meditative position upon her knees. Her aura was visible in this moment. A swath of blue that flowed in wispy waves up along her figure. Her aura was a beautiful sight to behold; the colour was vivid, though ethereal and transparent. There was no real influence of emotion while looking upon it, though one could imagine Star saw something similar, but around all other people. Except Star could read it. What just appeared to be colourful to the knight held a wealth of information for someone like Star. Enough to see mountains that weren't there. Enough to know when someone was lying. Enough to see straight through someone's emotional armor. Yet in return, even when her aura was plainly visible to the naked eye, it gave...Nothing. Just a pretty, enchanting blue colour that clung to her. She seemed focused on this, though soon after Ellesandra came out of the shower, she naturally concluded whatever she was meditating on. Her aura vanished slowly, then, as she looked pensively at...The floor again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pulled up to a stop when she saw the blue aura around Star. She stared at it in confusion at first, then once she realized what she was seeing she quickly turned away. If it was her aura, or her emotions, she had no right to stare at it and try to figure it out - not when she spent so much effort on building a barrier and boundary between herself and Star. Sitting on what would be her bed, she pulled her hair up into a ponytail so the wet strands would be out of her face, only glancing over at Star when she heard Star moving out of the meditative state. The continued pensive look at the floor made Ellesandra feel like something was terribly wrong. For someone like Star, to go so long like this without saying anything, what was she working through? The blue aura came to mind, but Ellesandra had no idea what that would mean. Her only guess was sadness, but just because something was blue didn't mean it was necessarily sad, right? And even so there was probably way more niche information that Ellesandra didn't know what to look for, even if she had wanted to. Still, the possibility that she'd done something to so thoroughly upset Star that she had gone silent and staring at random things bothered Ellesandra enough to speak up and break the silence. "What exactly has you so quiet and introspec-introver-er." Introspective was the word she was going for, but the way to say it was slipping her mind. She blinked, thinking, and having a complete brain fart on it shook her head. "thoughtful?" She finished, reaching into her bag for the medical supplies to begin working on rebandaging her arm, raising her sleeve up to do so.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked up when Ellesandra stumbled over their words. She gave them a smile. No judgement, just patience as they figured out what they were trying to say. She then had to stare at Ellesandra for a few moments as she gathered what she wanted to say. "...I can't tell you, Ellesandra," she said, still smiling a small, sad smile. "It'll just lead to questions that I can't ask, and topics that aren't allowed. I'll be okay. Promise. I just...Need some time to feel sad. The sad feeling won't go away until I...Feel it. Let it be felt. Let it...Naturally flow through me. It'll be okay." An attempt at a reassuring smile followed, though it wasn't...Very reassuring at all. Star still wore her emotions plainly. And she was hurting inside. She fought against that hurt, trying desperately to put on a smile to allow Ellesandra to be happy, too. Or as happy as they could be, given the mountain that didn't exist that wasn't weighing on them at all.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It took Ellesandra a moment to realize what she meant. Was she sad for Ellesandra? Because of her being so guarded? Or was that pity? Defensiveness rose in her and she shifted a little uncomfortably, thinking of what Star might feel she couldn't ask or topics that weren't allowed. The concept of just letting herself feel sad was foreign to Ellesandra though; sadness was a weakness. She didn't let herself feel it, only feeling it when it forced itself out. Shaking her head, she turned her attention to the bandaging and ensuring that the cut in her arm was healing decently enough. She'd do her thigh afterwards, just taking them one step at a time. "You're allowed to ask anything, just respect me being allowed to say no or not answer." She hadn't been sure she wanted to open that door; it was probably easier for Star to just not ask when Ellesandra knew she'd stonewall the mage anyways. But the idea that Star thought she couldn't even ask potentially unrelated questions bothered Ellesandra; her boundary was around herself, not around Star's ability to ask questions.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to the words given. "I do. And I also don't want to fight with you, even a little. So it's prudent for me to acknowledge when the things I feel, the things I want to say, are only going to lead us towards my desire to...Talk to you about things you do not want to talk about, and your desire to, well...Not. It's just hard for me, y-you know?" she said, doing her best to repress what was clearly a rising sorrow that threatened to make her cry. Her voice shook, but she paused to breathe and steady herself, keeping her on the calm side of things. "I can't help who I am. I can't help that hearing about how you blame yourself tears me up inside. And I don't even want to say such things...Because then, well...Is that not just all the more likely to make you redouble your desire to push it all down? To pound upon your heart with an iron first until it submits, not caring for what wounds you leave in the wake?" She bit her lip here. "Just...I'll stop. Before I get carried away. I have...Too much to say, and as I said I...Can't bear to argue with you. I don't want to. It hurts..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked up after finishing her bandage, watching Star struggle to keep her voice calm, to repress the tears. The guilt built again, but she also pushed it back down again. Then winced when Star called her out for doing that exact thing. She couldn't win, could she? How was she supposed to respond to this? The only way she thought Star would be okay with her responding to it would be to completely open up, but Ellesandra wasn't okay with that, so they were very much at odds there. She pursed her lips, watching Star for a moment, then stood and walked over to her. Sitting down on the bed next to Star, she raised her arm to begin wrapping it around Star. She went slowly, so that Star could pull away if she wasn't okay with that, but would allow space for Star to be pulled into her side and place her head on Ellesandra's shoulder, should she wish. The touch was hesitant. Ellesandra's emotional barriers were up as strongly as she could put them up, even if they weren't entirely effective. But she didn't want Star repressing emotions just for her. Ellesandra repressed emotions for herself; Star didn't. "If you need to cry, and you're comfortable with doing it, then do so. No words are necessary for why." She held back an apology, wanting to tell her she was sorry for how much baggage she brought with her. She was also supremely uncomfortable with offering this touch, but if it was a matter of making Star feel better, or living in her own discomfort, she would choose Star's feelings every time. At least, in something as small as just offering physical touch as support.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star might have been able to see the internal struggle Ellesandra faced, if she was looking at them. But she shifted her head back to looking at the floor. Her favourite patch of floor, in fact, in this whole room. She only did look up again when Ellesandra rose to move over to her bed. She was uncertain how to feel about it, but she didn't have much time before Ellesandra joined her and opened an arm to her, then went beyond a mere offer to forwardly bring her into a hug. She wouldn't have the emotional fortitude to resist a hug from Ellesandra at her apex, so feeling so vulnerable in the moment she was helpless. She leaned against them, rested her head against their shoulder, and quietly let a few tears flow from her. One hand moved along their back, the other slid up to their opposite shoulder to gently cling to it. Her eyes closed and she simply...Basked in the comfort Ellesandra's hug gave her. It didn't fix anything. It just...Helped. Made the hurt quiet. She had no reservations crying in front of Ellesandra, even if the reverse wasn't true. But with the comforts provided, Star was not breaking down into sobs. Just a silent stream of tears, free from sobs. Maybe the occasional sniffle. Truly, it did help her. The emotional barriers were raised, but there still was some amount of...Leakage that seemed to be unable to be closed. As if the dam was permanently damaged. Was it because Star was unable to maintain her side of it? Certainly, she was more capable of it than Ellesandra's budding control over it. Or perhaps it was more to do with the resonance? Either way, some of Star's sorrow leaked through into Ellesandra. Not to force them to feel the same, but for them to have that, perhaps familiar at this point, out-of-body understanding of the emotion that Star felt, exactly as she felt it. It carried echoes disturbingly similar to Ellesandra's own guilt. The desire to help...The contested sensation of inadequacy...The self-sacrificial desire to take pain unto one's self...A pain that resonated with flickers of guilt, of ownership. Star's emotions were complex, perhaps only because she allowed herself to feel them all; by contrast, Ellesandra might struggle to feel little beyond guilt overwhelming at times. But Star? Star let her emotions flow free in her heart. The clashing of guilt, of sorrow, of determination, of everything she could feel in the moment all at once. And though Ellesandra was feeling only a tiny echo of it, the complexity, even if not the raw intensity, was plain for them to feel. Sitting behind that dam was a wave of emotion that would dwarf the mountain of guilt that Ellesandra definitely did not feel. For it was not just emotion on its own; Star's very emotion sung with power within her aura. Even here, in her sadness, the slow blossoming of mana from her heart was clear and trivial to pinpoint in this moment, where it had been so obscure before. From emotion, Star was empowered.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Even through the barrier, she sensed the sorrow and guilt coming from Star as well. Ellesandra winced as she felt it, coming through the apparent aura bond they had, or whatever it was to Ellesandra. She took a deep breath, doing her best to ignore it, and looking away from Star's tears. They made her uncomfortable, and her half hug - while fully intended and not half-hearted, because she did want to make Star feel better - was awkward at best. Still, her eyes turned up to look at the door while Star silently just, felt. She just lived with the sadness that was in her, let it process, and honestly this was something that Ellesandra was a little envious of. The ability to just feel emotions and then have them not be a thing anymore - she didn't think she could do that. The pure depth to Star's emotions rivaled Ellesandra's own - nay, maybe even outdid it, though Ellesandra didn't actually feel them to be able to properly compare. It was almost overwhelming, feeling the pressure behind all of Star's emotion, and how she was just letting it slowly work through herself. She did her best to not let any of this become obvious or noticeable to Star, not wanting to distract Star from how she processed her own emotions, or make her think she needed to take care of Ellesandra instead. There were no words spoke, not unless Star said anything first, Ellesandra just looking around the room quietly and waiting it out, providing physical comfort as essentially the only thing she could do in this situation. Her hand, which had stayed in a single spot on Star's side for a few minutes at first, had begun to lightly rub up and down, like someone might do to one's back when trying to comfort.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The physical comfort continued to be everything that Star needed, short of actually addressing any of...This. Nothing was solved by this moment they shared, but it at least provided Star with gentle reassurances that Ellesandra, to whatever degree, cared about her. Concern enough to be there when she was vulnerable despite their own discomfort. Of course Star could feel the discomfort. The envy. The subtle feeling of being overwhelmed. She could see it in the moments where her eyes were open, even if the direct connection between them had an attempt to block the two off from one another, a barrier both women tried to maintain but ultimately could not perfect. But these things did not distract Star. She accepted the comfort. The gentle rubbing in particular invited her to shuffle just slightly more against the knight and hold just a tiny bit tighter. Ellesandra might feel awkward or uncertain or a thousand other apprehensive emotions at this physical contact, but Star always was, and perhaps always would be, open with such emotion and tenderness around those close to her. Eventually, the tears did stop. Calmness and serenity returned, slowly. It was not happiness that took the place of sorrow, but...Calm neutrality was still a step towards the right direction. Not wishing to further discomfort Ellesandra, Star slowly retreated from the hold once she had weathered the worst of her bubbling emotion. Eyes were a bit puffy, but mostly dry now. Despite this, she still didn't seem to have much to say aside from a quiet, almost inaudible 'Thank you' said as she pulled away and a vaguely forced smile. She retreated into her mind again, staring off at nothing. As promised, she seemed...Okay. A stable state, one that would allow her to hold a conversation if Ellesandra wanted to talk. But whatever deeper, underlying troubles she had remained. The aforementioned forbidden subjects weighed on her still. Truly, it could only be a matter of time before the empath was overcome by her own empathy for someone as deeply troubled as Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She released Star when she started to pull away. The almost inaudible thank you was ignored, if it had been heard at all. As Star pulled away and began staring away again, Ellesandra watched her for a moment. Her concern was only increased with the continued silence. Sure, Star wasn't crying any more, but she obviously still struggled with something. Ellesandra wouldn't push it though, letting Star process whatever was bothering her how she wished, just like Ellesandra would like to do if something was bothering her. Standing, she headed over to her own bed and moved to the side that would have her back to Star, slightly pulling down breeches enough to rebandage the wound on her thigh. Ellesandra didn't bring anything else up, letting the afternoon go silently until or unless Star said anything. She finished replacing the bandage on her thigh after disinfecting the wound with a bit of alcohol, then pulled her breeches back up entirely and turned to lay back on the bed. Her body was still sore, and needed rest, but she didn't sleep, her right arm thrown up to rest across her forehead while she stared up at the ceiling. Quiet and resting her fatigued muscles, but not letting herself fully rest for fear that Star would go do something stupid like sneak out while Ellesandra was asleep and get herself into trouble.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star seemed to deflate a little more as Ellesandra moved away from her. Had they done something wrong? It was impossible to say. She simply was in her own mind, stuck and introspective. But she didn't stop the knight from departing. She just adjusted to delve into meditation again. She remained in this posture for some time; eventually, her aura once again became visible. Where there was one just a solid, medium blue, there was now a swath of colour. She did not glow with any particular luminosity while meditating, so it would not prove to be a disturbance to Ellesandra if they did close their eyes or attempt to sleep. But if they did observe, the colours that mingled into her aura were a complicated mess covering the entire rainbow, every colour fathomable flickering in and out of existence upon her still mostly blue aura. A turbulence, perhaps? Was this what Star saw in others? It was simply...Indecipherable. It had no meaning in the moment, despite it's quiet beauty. She remained in this for hours, silent and unmoving. Night would come before she broke out of this meditative state, unless Ellesandra had reason to disturb her from it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't realize Star had still wanted her there, after pulling away. Ellesandra was the type to want space, and she had just assumed Star had wanted the same once she'd pulled away from the hug. As she lay there and saw the colors out of the corner of her eye, she turned to glance at them. She didn't realize she was staring at first, frowning as she tried to see all the different colors, but then when she realized what she was looking at - the same aura and emotions that Star supposedly saw in other people, an insight to someone's emotions and maybe thoughts, she instantly turned her head away. Star was much more open about her emotions, but Ellesandra still wasn't going to just try to read or decipher what she saw simply because she saw them. As pretty and interesting as the colors were, and odd as it was to see all of them surrounding Star while she meditated, Ellesandra was respecting a privacy that wasn't even asked for; a desire to do the type of thing that she herself wished could be done for her. And so, the majority of the day passed. At some point while Star was meditating, Ellesandra had let herself drift off into a nap. It was one of those hyper aware naps, where any movement or sound caused her eyes to open and to look in that direction. The type of thing someone who was trained to guard someone and be woken by the smallest of things could do easily, but looked like she was just sleeping fitfully to anyone else. She shifted positions a handful of times, just letting the relaxing afternoon work it's magic on healing them. As night approached, she did move to stand and stretch, working out kinks in muscles, before going to the door. She considered interrupting Star to ask what she wanted for dinner, but decided to let her stay in meditation while she slipped out of the room to go get some dinner for them both. About ten minutes later, after Ellesandra had watched the stairs leading to their room like a hawk for any potential danger headed towards Star while waiting for food, she came back in with two steaming plates of food. Some beef and potatoes with a healthy serving of brown gravy over both, and some vegetables. Ellesandra had obviously moved some of the veggies from her own plate over to Star's, but it wasn't like she'd gotten rid of all of her own. "Star." Was all she said as she entered, to ensure that if the movement and noise, or smell of the food, didn't bring Star out of her meditation then maybe her name would.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It was difficult to tell how much awareness Star had while she was meditating. Either she was just unaware of things, or she was aware and just very good at keeping still and not paying mind to them. Not that there was much to disturb her, but it very much did appear she was deep in whatever trance state she had assumed. When Ellesandra returned, the colours had shifted to a uniform, sky blue. No other flecks of other colours to be seen. Hearing her name, however, saw her aura receding again. She looked at Ellesandra and wore a lightly exhausted smile. She was still tired. The meditation seemed to steady her, but more than that it was seeing Ellesandra's thoughtfulness again that had her smiling. She adjusted in her seat on the bed to accept the food, taking note of the adjusted portion. If the meat portions were equal, Star would offer to give about half of her beef portion to the other. After all, it wasn't just that she had her preference, but also that she knew Ellesandra's own. She had noticed the way the knight had delighted in filling their plate with meat just as she delighted in berries and steamed vegetables. It was a perfect balance where each one had the complimentary desire for the less preferred thing on the other's plate. It was a small thing. But as much as the two clashed on the matters of the heart, this was one way in which the two were in perfect harmony with each other. Yet aside from any transactional dialogue, Star still, uncharacteristically, had little to say. Perhaps she was just hungry.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra allowed Star to move some of her meat onto her plate, though was careful to watch how much. Even if Star didn't like meat much, she needed the protein and sustenance to help recover. The continued silence worried Ellesandra, but only in that it was abnormal for Star. She was comfortable with silence, enjoyed it even, so it wasn't the silence itself that bothered her at all. However, the longer it went on as they ate and Star still didn't say anything, seeming withdrawn, the more Ellesandra was concerned for Star's well being. She wanted to ask what was wrong, but knew that doing that would open up conversation paths that would not end well, based on what Star had said previously. It was honestly best to just let the situation lie as it was, trusting Star would get over whatever it was and move on, back to her normal self. Which was exactly what Ellesandra would do. She'd finish her food, and when Star was done she'd take their plates and drinks back downstairs to be washed. When she returned, unless Star would do anything different than normal, Ellesandra would go about nightly activities. She took it easy on any exercise, since her body was still recovering from her haste spell, and simply worked on stretching out her right shoulder muscle to work out the kinks and soreness that came with it whenever she used overused it - which meant anytime she used the haste spell. There were a few twinges of pain, but nothing that was unexpected for old injuries, and afterwards she would lay back down, content to just rest like she'd done the whole day.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The silence was comfortable for Ellesandra, but there were subtle signs that it wasn't ideal for Star. She had a lot on her mind, and she certainly was no stranger to sorting through her emotion, through her thoughts. But even if she smiled when sharing her portion of meat with Ellesandra, mindful to keep some to herself but ensuring of course in turn that the thoughtful sharing of some of the knight's food with her wasn't putting the knight themselves at a caloric deficit, the smile came with a weight hanging on it. The truth of the matter was that what it was at the core wasn't even a terribly big deal. Star being such an emotional woman simply meant that certain things struck her deeply, and she wasn't able to, or perhaps willfully did not hide her emotions like Ellesandra did. Perhaps she could don a mask and Ellesandra would be none the wiser to any of it. But as much as Ellesandra might feel the privacy of emotion was unequal, Star's emotional sensitivity ensured that no special powers were required to read her emotions in the moment. She ate. She was polite. She spoke when spoken to...But she was stuck inside herself for the time being, and if Ellesandra wasn't about to do anything to change it, then Star would go through her nightly routine and settle into bed without a word.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't do anything, not at first. The night passed normally and as Star was beginning to do her nightly wind down activities, Ellesandra suddenly stood and moved to the door. "Be right back." She slipped out, ensuring that Star didn't think she was suddenly leaving or anything. About ten minutes later, she'd return and open the door, but not enter. She was carrying two mugs with some sort of steaming hot liquid in them that smelled of something sweet - chocolate. She stood in the doorway and motioned with her head for Star to follow her. "Come." It was an order, and one that Ellesandra said simply expecting Star to follow along. She'd turn, walking down the hallway, and assuming she didn't get to the door at the end of the hall without Star following her, would open it and lead Star up some stairs. Without a word, she'd hand Star both mugs for a moment, reaching up and pulling down a trap door from the ceiling, which had a ladder that folded out from it. Then taking both cups again, she balanced them between her right arm and her torso to prevent spillage and began climbing the ladder with her left arm mainly, using her right elbow to stabilize on each step. Exiting the top, they were on the roof of the Inn. She ensured Star would get up to the roof without difficulty, then move to find a good place to sit in the center. Not too sloped, so that they didn't have to worry about sliding at all, and not blocked by anything, handing one of the mugs over to Star to smell and drink at her leisure. "Hot chocolate and a starry night, used to be the best to think through things."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wasn't expecting much to happen through the night. So to her surprise, the knight arriving with hot cocoa and a path to the roof of the inn? If not just because she wanted to do as Ellesandra asked unless she had reason not to, the curiosity of it all was enough to motivate her to join along. Her hair was still a bit damp from the shower, given how long and thick it was, but it wouldn't be a risk of a chill even at night. The nights had been warm lately. So when the two arrived on the roof and Star was able to secure a seat next to the knight, she had a small smile. She looked into her hot cocoa. The answers weren't there, but that didn't stop her from looking for them. "...Thoughtful as ever," she said quietly. The proximity almost ensured that Ellesandra would hear, but she was speaking to herself. Then, she spoke to Ellesandra directly. "I appreciate this. And I won't say that the company and ambiance doesn't help, because it does...But it's not really a matter of thinking things through for me. I promised I'd be okay, didn't I? I'm...Okay."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's anxiety seemed to spike a little when Star said she didn't have things to think through. She took a deep breath, closing her eyes and letting the anxiety flow through her for a moment. She hadn't really let herself think about this idea, not until she was sitting on the roof. Star needed to talk though, and this was going to be the only way Ellesandra could do so. He mug was brought up and sipped at, silently staring off across the roof tops tops before she responded. "I didn't bring you out here to do the thinking, Star." She settled with her feet placed flat on the roofing, knees up and arms partially wrapped around them, hugging them up close to her chest. The mug sat atop them while she looked anywhere but at Star, her jaw working from an obviously tense and nervous demeanor. "You obviously need to talk about something. You're afraid that it'll cause an argument, or you'll get shut down by me. But this helps me, so let's talk. What's on your mind?" It might not be Ellesandra throwing the door open for Star to come in, but at the very least, the window was cracked.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was surprised by the answer. But she smiled. It made sense, now. It was good, actually. Comforting, more than words could be, to see Ellesandra actually caring about their own emotions to some degree. Even if it was just seeking a little comfort for themselves. She looked up at the sky when the question was turned to her. "...More than you could possibly know. More than you'll be comfortable talking about, that's for sure," she said, though it was with an easy tone. One that accepted the reality, while still being happy for this chance. "...What you said at breakfast bothers me more than anything. More than you could have ever thought it would, I'd wager, else you wouldn't have said it. That you think of your wounds as mistakes, to start. I'm sure you could take a hardline thought to it and say that every single time you are wounded is somehow a mistake, somehow your fault, but to think that requires the belief that you're somehow possessed by wisdom and intelligence enough to perfectly predict every situation and every attack at all times, all the time. A mistake has to be reasonable in the moment, not just in hindsight. People don't often make mistakes intentionally, after all. It's why they're called mistakes." She paused here to sip her cocoa. "...But it's not like I'm upset at you because of poor grammar or something, this isn't some...Literary lecture." A smile, as she looked at her cocoa again. "It upsets me for two reasons. First being that if you were to tell me you're not giving it your all, that you're keeping a cool head and doing all you can to come out on top of the fights you get into, I'd be tempted to slap you for lying to both of us. The bravery I've seen you hold, the fearlessness, it's second to none. Not that you're impervious, I'm sure. But it's inspiring how you give it your all." Another pause. "...I'm not dumb though. It's not like I can't...Piece together some of the things you've said, connect some dots. Figure out with the insights that I have that the guilt you definitely don't feel because it doesn't exist and the frustrations you express about mistakes, how you clearly view it as some failing on your part, the handkerchief you aren't carrying around, and the thing you didn't blurt out to me when we got emotional back in Morrun's place...I don't know anything for sure, but it certainly gives me a few things to guess about what didn't happen, because nothing happened." Another pause for sipping her cocoa. "And because it all ties together, because this isn't about one single thing, but just how one word was the straw that broke the camel's back and put it all into context...That's why I thought it better to just not talk about it. I don't...Want to upset you. And if it requires me being upset so you don't have to be, well...That's kinda where it leads into my second point." Though what that second point was, she clearly was leaving until after Ellesandra had a chance to respond. Or not respond. "Just gonna throw out there that I recognize that was...A lot, all at once. And also gonna throw out that you asked for it," she said, smiling softly.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't answer while Star laid out all of her thoughts. About the comment from this morning, about how she'd connected it with the other things Ellesandra had said. Honestly, Ellesandra had assumed Star had made some of these connections even prior to that comment, but if that's what had made her close up, to get so introspective, then maybe Ellesandra was right in not sharing what had happened. Star didn't even know the entirety of it, and was just guessing at it. The anxiety mixed into some of the guilt that still existed as Star continued, but surprisingly there wasn't the same level of grief as there had been other times Star had approached the topic. No, there was still grief and sadness, but the other night of sobbing had seemed to do a large amount in helping relieve that load. She sipped at her drink again, letting silence build once Star was done. Her fingers tightened and then loosened, then tightened again around her mug while she considered what to say. There was twice that she opened her mouth, but nothing came out and she closed it again. She instead let the night air surround her, the smell of the evening and cocoa mixed, the sound of night creatures far off in the distance on the outside of town. It was still, with most people having been in their rooms or houses, and only some generic noise coming from the Inn below them. Finally, Ellesandra spoke. "Simply because someone is trying does not mean it's not still a mistake. A controllable one, no not necessarily. But it can still be a mistake. And you're closer to the truth than you think, though I'm not sure you can tell the extent of it." It was vague, but an answer - a confirmation for Star. There was something there, and she was close to figuring out what happened. Ellesandra ran a hand through her wet hair and snagged at the ponytail, mindlessly pulling the band off and letting her long hair flow down her back instead. "There are other mistakes that are undoubtedly mistakes though. Done in fits of rage, seeking revenge; not ones that you would argue weren't mistakes. Carelessness and recklessness." The movement was subtle, but her head lightly tilted to her right arm. "And those effect everything afterwards. The consequences of them effect my fighting. So, if I get hurt and you need to take that injury from me, it's a direct consequence of a mistake." She took another sip, then turned and gave Star a look, knowing damn well Star wasn't going to just accept that as truth or an excuse not to let Star heal her. "I was serious, that if it is something that needs to be done, I'll allow it. But otherwise, I'm not comfortable with it. I -" She paused and there was, out of nowhere, a sudden spike in the grief. Her throat closed and she closed her mouth, knowing she wouldn't get another word out right then. The grief and guilt twirled for a moment while she looked away again, forcing more hot cocoa down to try to calm herself. It didn't work, not entirely, but enough that she could finish the sentence. "I deserve the injury, if I let myself get injured. Not you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star remained calm in the face of Ellesandra's response. Where she might have previously stubbornly fought back and insisted, she just...Listened. "I have confidence that I have a vague idea of what didn't happen. I've avoided saying much about it, but from the moment I saw you, the very first moment, I could infer a lot. It's my gift, after all. That under your calm demands to the pirates, there was grief and guilt. A wounded heart. It was of course not until you outright told me, in perhaps not so many words, the source of it that I could really understand. Just understand that as much as I'm gifted in seeing emotion, that gift doesn't do all the work. I've had to learn to read between the lines of the things people say. Pick up on the little head nods towards wounded arms that people show me and connect the dots. Speculate on whether a scar on someone's back is from a sword or a whip from just a single glance at it. But, circling back to the first point a little.." She paused to take another sip. "Intent is very much what differentiates a degree of a mistake. If you walk into someone's house and bump a priceless vase and knock it over and it breaks, well...That's an accident. If you show remorse, if you explain how you didn't mean for that to happen, well...It matters. It doesn't un-break the vase, but...It matters. Sure as heck makes the response from the owner of the vase less hostile than if you walked in and grabbed the vase with a big sadistic grin on your face and spiked it at your feet then stomped on the fragments. Or if you just shrugged and coldly told them to not leave vases by the doorway. Just like how fighting with your all, and despite your best efforts still getting wounded is different than intentionally standing there and letting someone hurt you because you feel like you deserve to be punished." She let those words linger for a moment. "You're right that I don't know all that happened to you. That I don't know the context. And you don't have to tell me. I won't ask. But I'll remind you that I want to know. More than my calm words can convey, I want to know. But I want to respect your boundaries more. So...That's where that ends unless you decide otherwise." Another sip. "...We can all be careless and reckless sometimes. I'm not saying we're absolved of the consequences of our failures by our good intentions. But just as I said before...There has to be some allowance for us. We are, none of us, perfect. And I'm sure if I were to turn this on you instead, you'd find every excuse to try to absolve me. Or perhaps you wouldn't. So...Let me ask you rather than assume." She looked at Ellesandra again. "...If I find my mother dead, what should I feel? I told you what happened. I told you that, in the moment, perhaps I could have taken my mother with me, or insisted she come. Perhaps that could have saved her life. By not doing so, perhaps I allowed the fear I felt to stop me from intervening in what could very well have been the moment that sealed my mother's fate. So it's a direct result of my inaction." Another pause. A softer, slightly more serious tone then came from her, then. This question was important to her, even as it was left prefaced to some degree as a trap for Ellesandra to either agree with Star and acknowledge their own hypocrisy in excusing another's actions but not their own, or condemn Star to the same grief: "Should my mother's demise weigh on my shoulders, Ellesandra?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
What was she supposed to say? As Star continued speaking, Ellesandra just sipped until her cocoa was gone, and then she sat the mug to the side. She wrapped her arms around her knees entirely now, hugging them up close to her chest, and looking out over the town. Star wasn't entirely right, not with everything she said. Ellesandra hadn't just stood there and let someone stab her because she felt like she deserved it. Though - a twinge of pain came back up as she remembered what happened after all of it. And how she had, indeed, just taken her punishment without complaint. She let out a deep breath, lowering her forehead to her knees and working to push that feeling back down, the memory of her Marigold's parents. The silence stretched again, after Star posed the question to Ellesandra. How would respond to that? Ellesandra didn't move, considering. Moments passed, and then she turned her head to look at Star. "No one 'should' feel anything. You feel what you feel. How I would respond to the situation, were I to have a mother who encouraged me to run and I did so, I am sure I would handle that differently than you did. Any feeling you have there isn't inherently wrong, nor would mine be if I were in that situation." She paused, and then turned again, resting her chin on her knees and looking out over the sea. "I can't relate to being close to a mother, Star. But if I had one, if I loved her. I would feel guilty. I would feel guilty for leaving, even if I knew it was the best move right then. Staying would have distracted her, whereas leaving gave her a fighting chance. Guilty but hopeful. If she ended up dead, I would feel grief. Sorrow. Probably anger, a lot of it. Both at her for taking that choice away from me, and whoever did it to her. And if any of those are as overwhelming as...other things I've felt, I'd deal with them the only way I could while staying sane. While moving on." She looked back to Star now, her words dropping into a whisper. "I'd pretend it didn't happen."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't looked upset by the answer. She'd been exposed enough to Ellesandra's way of things to know vaguely what to expect. "Pretend it didn't happen but punish yourself for all of it anyway, you mean," she said with a calm smile. She mirrored Ellesandra's posture with legs hugged up to her chest, though she held onto her cocoa. "And hey, looks like you're not half bad at this empathy thing too. You know what it was like for me without me having said a thing about it. Guilty, but hopeful. Grief, sorrow, and anger...I've already had a lot of that over this, but plenty more waits if I find her dead, yes. But I can't do what you do, I'm afraid. Not that I would want to. It might have worked for you to some measure, but as an expert in emotions let me tell you that all you've done is ignore a festering wound. No more can you pretend this doesn't exist than you could a necrotic foot. That is to say, you can say you pretend it doesn't hurt all you want, but you're just lying to both of us." She kept a smile as she said these words. She had accepted Ellesandra for this, even if she clearly, very obviously, disagreed. "But I find it illuminating how easily you can apply nuance and judgement to the situation when your focus of your frame of mind is me, and not you. It's not to say that I'm assuming you don't have valid reasons to feel all these feelings that you do. Of course not. Like you said...You feel what you feel." She looked at Ellesandra here, meeting their gaze. "And you're going to feel it no matter how hard you try not to. And it's sat inside you, slowly chipping away at you. Poisoning you from the inside. Leading you to conclusions you truly believe...But I know for certain you would never tolerate coming out of my mouth. Things like...How you deserve to be hurt. How you deserve the injury, not me. And I could argue with you as the night is long...That you wouldn't suffer the wound if not for you needing to protect me, that it is, pragmatically, the best choice given your resistance to regular magic and it allows me more mana to do other things that are useful on the battlefield and that by not permitting it you are directly contributing to mistakes that can lead to even worse consequences - by your own logic, of course. But as I've said...I don't want to argue. All I can do is share with you what I see, and what I feel. So...Whether you want to sit with those words and say nothing, or talk about them some more, or something else entirely...There's something a little unrelated I'd like to share with you. If you'll let me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
That didn't seem fair. The defensiveness rose, but she didn't say anything. She held her response back, pressing her lips together. There was a difference between pretending a physical ailment wasn't there and an emotional one. She also had never said she'd deserved an injury in the line of protecting Star. If she got the injury in a fight, she deserved to get it because she'd been careless. Not because of any self-punishing thing - at least not consciously. The thoughts ran through her mind, but she prevented herself from saying them. Doing so really would lead into an argument with Star, which was exactly what Star had wanted to avoid. They simply didn't agree on these topics, and Ellesandra didn't think trying to explain her side would convince Star otherwise at all. So after a few moments of sitting with those thoughts but not speaking them, she just turned to look at Star and nodded. "Go ahead." Permission to discuss whatever was unrelated that was on Star's mind with a head nod, pushing the previous conversation to the back of her mind.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took the silence for what it was. The topic drew too close to disagreements. She could see the frustration and defensiveness. Star's view on emotions was naturally a deeper one than most, and with that came a reverence for them, and what led her to liken them to physical wounds. To her, they were fundamentally similar. But rather than say anything, she extended a hand to Ellesandra. "...Not words, but...A memory. A happy one. I figured we'd get here eventually if you insisted I share what was on my mind. So I came prepared to...Hopefully share with you something sweet. Something to give us a smile for the night."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned at the idea of a memory being shared. What did Star mean? Just that she was going to talk about it? But then her eyes fell to Star's hand, extended to her, and she remembered Star mentioning she could see memories in some people. And apparently share them that way as well. There was obvious distrust and caution come up, a fear that Star would somehow be able to reverse it and see Ellesandra's own memories. Did she want her to see those? Very much not, even if sharing them would make it easier than trying to explain them. She stared at that hand for a few moments, unconsciously reaching for her empty mug and trying to take a sip. It was gone, but it was the action that helped soothe the anxiety. With a deep breath, they reached out and took Star's hand, nodding. Not that she felt like she needed to experience a sweet smiling memory from Star, but that if it would help Star feel better she would comply.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star knew there was distrust. But it only reinforced the notion that she had to ensure Ellesandra felt that this was not an invasion of their privacy, but her opening up to them more. Not that Star was really closed off. But whether she could or not turn this on Ellesandra and jump through their memories was unknown, and the knight would have to believe either she couldn't, or that she wouldn't do it. One a matter of limitation, the other a matter of trust. Time would tell. But when Ellesandra took her hand, her aura blossomed off her again. It washed over Ellesandra, bringing a sense of serenity to them. It beckoned them to ease their eyes closed. Not forced, just...Soothed towards closing their eyes to share in the memory. And the memory that followed was one of Star and her mother. The viewpoint was from beyond. Like an unseen eye peering through the veil. Star was a small child. And it would be the first view Ellesandra would get of Star's mother. White hair, though slightly less snow-white than Star's. A bit more silvery. Eyes were also a slightly greener tint of blue, in contrast with Star's vibrantly blue irises. But the familial resemblance was more than obvious. Aurora. This was Aurora Lumina. A mature woman. The motherly gaze with which she gazed at Star spoke of the family bond enough without the resemblance. Little Star was still quite young in this memory. Big, twin braids flopped behind her as she ran into what looked to be the main living area of their home. Aurora was sitting upon the couch. The house was cozy. A little rustic. The furnishing weren't royal, but they were made with care. Aurora had a book in hand, but smiled as Star ran into the room. "Hello there my little twinkle-toes," said Aurora, her words adoring and loving through and through. Star giggle. "Mommaaaaaa! Sir. Bakersman came to visit! Come see, come see!" she insisted. Aurora smiled and set their book aside, then stood to follow Star as Star tugged her mother along to another room. Star then adorably began to mantle on a chair and then up onto the counter to kneel on the counter of what looked to be the kitchen and out the circular window. The vision shifted to behind their heads to reveal that Sir. Bakersman was...A squirrel. Aurora smiled, leaning slightly down to peer out the window with her child. Then, she reached forward to unlatch the window and pull it open. Aurora's aura then blossomed off her. Aurora's aura was similar, yet different to Star's. Tighter. More purposeful. More refined. More powerful. Controlled, though it retained its ethereal wispiness to it. Aurora extended a hand out. The squirrel hopped onto Aurora's hand from the tree branch that it was perched upon, crossing the small gap to land on Aurora's hand to sit in her palm. There was a trust in the body language of the animal. Aurora then pulled the squirrel in a little to let them down on the counter. "Now stay there a moment, Sir. Bakersman. Star, why don't you entertain him for a moment? I'll get him a tasty nut for his travels," she said, earning an enthused giggle and set of nods from Star. Star then set about petting the squirrel, who seemed calm as could be as she did so. "I know you've got a lot to do, Sir. Bakersman, so it is with great uhm...Great...Res...Uhm...Great happiness that you are welcomed!" she said with a giggle and kept about petting the animal. "Momma says if I keep trying, I'll figure out how to talk to you. You two better not be discussing my birthday surprise in secret! You gotta promise you aren't telling momma all my secrets, 'cause I showed you my diary in confidence! Mhm, mhm!" As Star had her fun, Aurora did leave and indeed return with a handful of nuts from their pantry. Aurora held them out for Star. Star examined them, plucking an acorn from the mixed pile and smiled as she offered it to the squirrel, who naturally took it and then turned to skitter away with the prize. Star giggled some more, so full of childish mirth. She then took the rest of the nuts and put them by the window. "Gotta leave the window open, 'cause what if he is still hungry later? I'll leave him a little pile to come back to." Aurora chuckled. "Are we just gonna invite the whole forest into our kitchen, my little sparkle?" she asked as she picked Star up to hold in her arms. She then shut the window and latched it while holding her daughter. "It'll be good practice for your aura sense. You know what Sir. Bakersman's aura feels like. So if you feel him come around again, you let me know and we'll make sure he has all he needs, okay?" she said, earning some enthused nods from Star. The two then moved back to the living room and Aurora sat down again, setting Star on her lap. Star then moved to lay down across her mother's lap, possessed by a warm smile. Aurora gently stroked Star's head, smiling. "I love you, Star. I always will." And with those words, the dream faded to white, returning Star and Ellesandra to their night atop the inn.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was definitely a happy memory, a cheery one that she was sure Star remembered fondly when thinking of her mother. Ellesandra's own reaction to it was bittersweet. A happiness for Star, to see how happy and loved she'd been by her mother, but there was also...envy. Disappointment. A feeling of missing out on these types of moments herself. It wasn't that she'd not had anyone to care for her as a kid, once she was taken in, but those who were her guardian's weren't...parents. At least not hers. They supported her, encouraged her to get better and find a career, but love her? Nothing like this. So while she pulled away from the memory, smiling softly to Star but pulling her hand away before any of her own memories that had come to the surface could flow back into Star, her own memory of the last time she'd seen the one who might be considered the closest thing to Ellesandra's mother came through her. There was shame, mostly of herself, and she pushed the memory away before she could relive too much of it. Before Star would feel bad for sharing such a pleasant memory of her mother, or see the reactions Ellesandra would certainly have to her own memory. "She obviously loved you. What ever became of Sir Bakersman? Did he come back and get more nuts?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see it. Despite not seeing the memory, she could still see Ellesandra's emotions. She knew this was possible. That she'd be, to some degree, shoving Ellesandra's face in how close she was with her mother. Not the intent in the slightest, no. But she was sympathetic all the same. She wore that sympathy in her eyes as she looked at her companion. She hugged her legs, leaning her head on them, turned towards Ellesandra. She smiled. "He did. Paw-paw'd at the window since they were right there in sight. I didn't sense him coming that day, but I got better at it. I just wanted to share that with you...Because now you know what she looks like. What she sounds like. And...Maybe gives you a bit of a better understanding of why it's so important to me that I do what I do. I know that...things weren't so easy for you. I remember you told me you were an orphan. You probably didn't need a reason or any reinforcement about what this means to me but...I hope you enjoyed it at least half as much as I do thinking back on it." She was a little misty-eyed, though it wasn't as easy to spot in the moonlight. "I won't bridge off that to talk about you, much as I do want to know more about your childhood and past and...The people you've cared about through the years. I just wanted to share that sliver of my happiness with you tonight." She sniffled. "I really love her, too. I really miss her."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She smiled at the idea of a squirrel pawing at a window to be let in to get nuts. As well as a child Star excitedly looking out for him to come pet him and feed him. A nod was given in regards to the information about her mother, turning back away from Star and staring out into the night once more. She was silent, not knowing how to respond as Star brought up her childhood, even if she reinforced that it wasn't intended as a bridge to talk about Ellesandra. The sniffling got to her, a weakness in seeing someone cry, to where Ellesandra scooted closer to Star and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. There were no words - what was she going to say, 'yeah I know you love her and miss her'? What benefit would that have? Instead, if Star accepted that touch, she'd continue looking out into the sea that could be seen across the horizon, the ships that were in dock right now. Her mind flitted through different things in her childhood, before things had gone wrong and soured her view of it all. There were few things she could think about or share without Marigold being involved, since Marigold had been such a large part of her life for essentially all of Ellesandra's memory, but eventually she did think of one that she thought could be shared. "After I was found, outside a burned down building that they assume my parents had died in, I was taken in by a very well to do family." She started off, chewing on her lip and intentionally keeping things very vague. She didn't want to go into too much detail about any of it, since it would beg questions. Keeping it vague felt like an obvious boundary. "Well to do enough that they had a personal swords trainer on staff, and I remember sitting on a bale of hay in the training grounds. I must have been - five, six? And this woman, I've never admired someone so. She was an Acolyte of Torm, having left his temples to serve the family of her partner. Best fighter I've ever seen, even to this day. I don't think I ever, even as I came into my own in training, landed a blow she didn't intentionally leave open to test my awareness. Black and grey, salt and pepper colored short cut hair, for a while in my teens I tried to emulate her with the short hair because my admiration had turned into a little bit of hero worship and attraction for your teacher, situation. Didn't really fit me, though." She reached up, running a finger through her hair briefly. Her own round face didn't fit the style of a short cut military style; her face was too 'cute', and not quite as sharp or strong as her teacher's had been. "I don't remember a mother, not like the mother you had. Those who took me in provided a purpose, a shelter and food, but they weren't parents." She said this with a shrug. That part had never bothered her; she'd never sought that type of affection from them. Well, it hadn't until the last few days she'd seen them. She hadn't realized just how little they'd thought of her. The shame came back, but she forced it down again. "So her, she would probably be the closest thing I have to a mom, a mom like yours anyways." A snort came out of nowhere. "Not that she'd ever deign to let me lay my head in her lap. She would have slapped my ass and told me if I had time to lay against her I had time to work on my stance. But it was always done with the goal of improvement because she wanted to ensure I could protect myself. A genuine caring, in her own way."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was once more a little surprised, but not unpleasantly so, to have Ellesandra scoot over and loop an arm around her. It brought a smile to her lips. She might sniffle, but her face wrote how touched she was all across her features. It was a small gesture, but an important one for Star. Physical touch was important to her. A manifestation of a bond between two people. She leaned into the touch, into the hold. Not a peep was heard from the empath while Ellesandra spoke. Just a series of warm smiles that brightened across her lips at various points in the story. There was some darkness on her features at the notion that Ellesandra had caretakers, not parents. A parent didn't need to be blood. But it sounded like love was a scarce resource in Ellesandra's home. All that did was quietly give Star resolve to ensure that Ellesandra felt her care as their friend. More so when seeing the shame rising in Ellesandra. She didn't comment, but it remained tucked away with the many insights she had about the woman that she held in her heart with the hope of someday, somehow, giving Ellesandra something to smile about. A smile so wide and so genuine that it brought them to tears. Yes. That was a fine dream to hold onto. Something that only reinforced her desire, her drive, to keep Ellesandra close. They might be her guardian for now...But no matter what fate had in store for them, she wanted to ensure beyond all doubt that she and Ellesandra would never forget one another, and smile when they thought of one another. "Everyone shows love in different ways," she said quietly, smiling. "I like hearing about people who made you smile. About people who cared about you." She left out her thoughts on the matter that the knight sounded to be severely lacking in people like that in their life. "She raised a fine knight. Finer than any I've ever met, certainly. And I have indeed met my share."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't really look at Star much during her story, so she wasn't seeing how her smile spread at different parts of her story. The idea of telling Star about people who made her smile though brought back memories of the only one who had done so consistently, and that just sent a shock of pain through her system. She did make a dismissive, disagreeing hum at the fine knight comment as well, trying to play off the pain she was sure Star had seen briefly as disagreement about whether she was a fine knight. Ellesandra was certain that her old mentor would be ashamed to claim her as a student. She hadn't seen her mentor after the incident and before she left, but Ellesandra knew - or at least she thought she did. In reality, she'd have been welcomed with open arms if she'd gone to her mentor, but Ellesandra had not been in a mental state to believe or do that. She still wasn't. "So, there." Ellesandra said, clearing her throat of the memory of one more thing she'd lost. She once again pulled her knees up to her chest, and sidled a little bit away from Star. This time it wasn't a matter of wanting distance, but that after a moment Ellesandra laid back on the roof and spread her arms out, staring up into the night sky. "Don't expect stories like that often." She warned, not wanting this to be a precedent set where Star would expect Ellesandra to open up about things from her childhood or past.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept her posture, despite the flicker of desire to mirror Ellesandra and lay next to them. That brought a momentary...Weird feeling in her chest that was gone again before she could focus on it and put any meaning to it. So she just stayed where she was, knees held to her chest. Maybe she just needed this self-comfort. She looked up at the stars some more as well, all the same. "I don't hold any expectations. Just hopes," she said with a soft giggle under her breath. "Just for the record, I don't mind sharing. I know you're a private person. I respect that. But you don't have to treat me as you want me to treat you in this respect. I'm sure it's not the same for you but...I like to relive memories. Good, and bad. I like to share myself with the people I care about." Ellesandra was obviously the subject of this, though she kept it general to avoid pointing a spotlight on the knight. "So don't be afraid to ask, if you ever find yourself curious. If it helps your pragmatic mind, maybe you can just think of it like...Understanding the details of the mission. Fishing for clues." She giggled. "Might be something relevant in my stories that I just hadn't considered. Definitely not me making up excuses to give us more to talk about, ehe.~"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Hopes. Ellesandra had to resist rolling her eyes at this. Why would anyone hope that Ellesandra revealed more about herself? It wasn't like her past was pleasant, a good story to listen to. She wasn't one of those adventurers who would go to a tavern and tell tales of their exploits all through the realm. There was no comment though as Star extended the offer to open it up on her own side, even the implication that she cared for Ellesandra. Which was ludicrous, considering they'd only known eachother for a few days - most people didn't learn to care about anyone that quickly. Was it this resonance thing, or whatever harmony it was? She shook her head, finding herself smiling in amusement at Star's giggling and ending 'ehe'. "You don't need my permission to talk about yourself, Star." She opened her mouth, about to add 'as long as you understand it might not be reciprocated', but stopped and closed her mouth. That boundary had already been drawn, multiple times. Star knew, and shoving her face in it when Star wasn't pushing wasn't going to do any favors for them getting along. So, she closed her mouth and settled back into the roof, repositioning so that the wooden slat beneath her wasn't pressing into her shoulder uncomfortably. "Don't just randomly send me memories though, please. I'd like warning before that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled, unseen to the woman laying beside her as she kept her gaze forward and upward. "You sure do live by a strict set of rules, don't you?" she asked, perhaps rhetorically. "I'm not asking permission. I can say whatever I want, whenever I want. But just because I can talk about something, doesn't mean you want to hear it." She looked over her shoulder to smile at Ellesandra. "If you don't want to know anything about me, hear anything about me, there's not much reason for me to talk about it, is there?" Another question that seemed rhetorical, meant just to make her point than to actually demand an answer from the knight. She turned her eyes over to the water, then. "I'm not sure where you get this idea of me that I'm purposefully going to trample over every boundary between our emotional selves. Believe it or not, I care very much about preserving the privacy of peoples' emotions. Which might sound a bit strange, since I can see everyone's emotions," she said with a giggle. "But I can't help that much. What I can help is what I do with that knowledge. And of course, what I always want to do is help people. And sometimes that means putting a bold step forward, but...Most of what I see in others, I keep to myself. There's something I do with others, once in a while. I can bridge my aura to another person and temporarily let them see what I see. And if you ever did want to see the world through my eyes, you might understand a little more what I mean. The world is always alive, always brimming with colour. But I've never done that with someone I am resonant with, obviously. So better to just leave that as a...Thing to ponder for a while, maybe never to do." It wasn't like Star to shy away from something like this; she had said herself she enjoyed being open. And that she had shared this connection of her sight with others in the past. It was perhaps the first time it was Star being hesitant about sharing some part of herself, regardless of what Ellesandra thought about it. "Sorry. Rambling...I just was trying to say I'm not going to go doing what you said. I'd never want to bridge our auras without your consent. I want to respect your boundaries as much as I'm physically able to. It's just harder to do with you than it has been with anyone else. I'm sorry that that is how it is. I know it frustrates you."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra almost laughed at the rules. Rules helped her with a lot of things, helped her socially anxious ass know what was appropriate in certain situations. The rhetorical question was nonetheless answered with her shaking her head. Still, the discussion of not walking over Ellesandra's boundaries made her roll over to her side, watching Star curiously. She had a thoughtful expression on her face as she did, letting silence fill the air for a few moments after Star's comment about allowing Ellesandra to see things Star did, before she answered. "I wouldn't want to do that. It's not that I distrust you, specifically, Star in that you would intentionally bulldoze through the boundary I've tried to create, or that others do. I find your power, inherently, invasive." She took a breath, shaking her head. "I know you can't control it, and that you're doing your best to do so when we touch, but if the shadow is right that's especially hard to do with me because of whatever resonance or harmony we have together." She waved her hand, waving off the more technical explanation and just assuming Star would follow along with it. "At first, I was afraid you were going to just ignore my wish and decide that you were too curious not to. And that you'd hide behind the guise of wanting to help me because I'm in pain or something like that. I don't think that anymore, I know you wouldn't intentionally do anything like that. But your power is hard to control with me, and even if it's not your fault I don't feel comfortable with that. So when I reaffirm my boundary, know that I'm not criticizing you. It's honestly more for my benefit than anything, and I recognize that it's not something you can control when you do that. It's also why I would never want to use your power to see other's aura's like you do. I find it invasive to them even if they're open to it, and I can control it by not taking you up on the offer."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded along with the knight's explanation. "In this case, I think you're right to worry it would be difficult to maintain that boundary in such a case. And I try to realize you're not criticizing me. I try. But there's part of me that can't help but feel rejected for something I can't control." She shook her head. "That's equally not your fault. It's just completely different from what I was used to growing up. With my mother, we could hold each other any time and there was this...Unspoken way we could communicate, since we share the same gift. There's nothing as comforting to me as being able to do that with someone, even if I know it would be a lot to task of even a generally open person." Read: Not you, Ellesandra. "I obviously had to learn to have trust people at their word, read context, all of that. But as much as my gift is something I consider a blessing, it hasn't come without its struggles. It's...Hard to put into words what the anxiety can be like sometimes. I see anxieties in other people and they can be strong, yes. But it's not quite the same anxiety that I feel needing to trust in the unknown, instead of being allowed to hold someone and let our hearts connect. It's so much harder to convey how I feel to other people with words." She paused a moment. "...I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm just doing my best. And no matter how strongly I feel that that connection I can have with someone because of my gift is a beautifully special thing, it won't stop me from acknowledging that you feel the way you feel, and that your views are as they are. This whole subject just has put this...Longing in my heart. So I apologize in advance if I'm sounding a little more sentimental than usual." She then smiled and threw out a distraction before Ellesandra could properly reply to any of that, giving them an out to just move on from it all without a word: "...The stars are bright tonight. Beautifully so."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She listened, not quite sure what to say to what Star was sharing. It might not come as a surprise to anyone, but Ellesandra wasn't good at these types of conversations even at the best of times. She could tell when someone needed comfort, but she wasn't always good at giving it, as seen by the simple hug that was done awkwardly and uncomfortable occasionally. Verbal comfort? Ellesandra was bad at it. She wasn't the type to just agree with someone and vent about something, talk about boys or girls you were interested in and complain how they were dumb dumbs for not being interested in you back. With the topic change to the Stars, a thought flitted through Ellesandra's mind. Her eyes ran up and down Star's back, knowing that if Star were not a client, her charge, she would probably have made the comment that came to her. That at least one Star was particularly beautiful that night. She refrained, however. Flirting with a charge was a good way to get herself hurt again, and upset a client most likely, considering Ellesandra had no intention of opening up to a lover. And Star very much did not seem the type to be able to have a night of passion and then act like nothing happened the next day. So, without comment she turned to her back and stared up at the sky again, grunting softly in agreement. "I've looked at the stars more in the past few nights than I have in years." She commented, considering. She normally didn't bother looking up at the sky, not unless she thought there might be danger coming from it or anything.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a calm silence that overtook Star for a moment. Something pensive. Something that suggested she was retreating inwards again. Then she just shook her head for seemingly no reason, then eased back to lay down, hands folded on her middle. "There might not be answers among them...But they've always inspired me. Kinda lame, isn't it? That me, with my name, of all people, would feel that way?" A small giggle. "But it is who I am. And if there is one thing I am good at it's...Being completely, unashamedly...Me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra scrunched her face up in confusion. "Why would it be lame? Your family has history with celestial objects, apparently naming children like that. Your mother being named Aurora doesn't make it lame for her to enjoy looking at Aurora's, does it?" She shrugged, considering back to her childhood when she cared if people thought she was lame. These days, being called lame wouldn't bother her at all. Lame was safe, expected, predictable. The only part of her that she didn't want to be predictable was her fighting, or her work guarding someone. If she was too predictable there, it could get a charge in trouble or in danger. Everything else? What other people thought of it didn't matter; they couldn't think any less of her than she already did. "Did your family have any stories in regards to the stars, or things as such? I've heard some religions tend to dedicate certain constellations to their deities and attribute the creation of such to them, though I'm not sure how much I believe that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star just smiled and laughed under her breath. She didn't really have an answer as to why it was lame other than just the connection between name and object. Did one cause the other? Or was her mother just astute and felt some energy, some feeling that she would feel this way? She hoped she might be able to ask her mother someday. She still hoped they were out there. "I remember the first time she showed me an aurora, to explain what she was named after. I asked her if that was the aura of the world," she said with a giggle. "Auroras look a lot like what I see around people. Some people are more colourful than others. Everyone's aura is unique. So when I saw it in the sky, I thought it might be a glimpse about how the sky felt, and I just couldn't reach out and feel it yet. Unfortunately, that was just me being a silly little girl. As for stories? There's one." She paused a moment, recalling the story. "...My mother told me about one star in the sky, something she called the star of guiding silver and purest white. A star that shone only once every thousand years. A star that, if it hung high in the sky, could be called upon to shine down a healing light upon the one who beseeched it. The silvery white light of the star could cure the worst curses, the deepest wounds. It could comfort the greatest sadness and banish darkness wherever it shone." She paused another moment. "There was...A great, terrible war in my homeland long ago. The story goes that there was a man of the most vile hatred for life that he saw fit to exterminate everyone under the guise of a promised ascension to something greater than themselves. But being so charismatic as he was, he rallied cultists under his rule to spread across the three realms of my homeland, plunging everything into war. Each innocent slain rose again to serve under the army of the Grand Magician, Faust. A darkness that spread across the land so dark that it threatened to snuff out all life. But on one fateful night, my mother told of a story that she was passed from her mother, and to them from their mother, going back as far as anyone can remember, that one night when all seemed at its darkest, the white-silver star shone in the sky. And from the heavens descended the savior of the realms, who we know only as Silent Purity. An angel, with wings of purest alabaster, a sword that shone light bright enough to banish darkness across the plane of Sun, Moon, and Star in one glorious thrust to the sky, and a mask over their face. Never to speak a word under an oath of silence. And this is a story known all through my homeland; the scars of this war remain in some places even to this day, unless a great deal has changed since I was separated from it. But most who tell the story simply say the angel came down on just some fated night. It is only when my mother told it to me that she said Silent Purity brought with her the white-silver star from the heavens, plucking it from its home in the sky for when the land needed it most to shine amidst her golden halo as she banished the darkness. Ultimately...The story concludes not with a righteous salvation, but sacrifice. That Silent Purity held high the white-silver star, but that Faust dragged Silent Purity with him to his grave. That she saved the land, but had known from the moment she descended from the heavens she knew her fate was to die for us all. So...As you can expect, there is a fair amount of reverence for her that lived on. Statues built in her image, some who worship her. But it was all supposedly a thousand years ago or so. So I imagine the devotion these days is much less than it was in the era where the realm rebuilt itself after the catastrophe."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra listened raptly. She didn't watch Star, instead eyes gazing across the many speckles of light in the night sky, but she fully paid attention to the story. It was hard not to relate the story to those she knew as a kid, most closely to Torm himself and his sacrifice as well as the sacrifice of the thousands of mortals who supposedly gave their souls to empower Torm. And his resurrection, which she had fond memories of celebrating. They were some of the few times that she spent away from Marigold, and though she still had bitter sweet memories with her mentor during such celebrations, there were many in which Ellesandra lost herself to drink, food, and the pleasures of a night's company during them. Not as many as she would have liked, before she was fully turned away from the god. "Sometimes I wonder if all of the stories we hear about deities are really just one deity in different forms. So many of them are extremely similar to one another; are they making up stories of such because they know it works for us mortals to connect with them and believe in them more? Are they truly as similar to one another as they seem sometimes?" She shrugged, looking over to Star finally. "Silent Purity, though. Quite a name to have to live up to, with self-sacrifice. Certainly a worthy role model and someone to look up to as a child."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I don't have the answer to that. But if that's the case, this one god sure does like to fight with themselves. Bahumat and Tiamat. Selune and Shar. Lathander and Myrkul. Corellon and Lolth, and Gruumsh. Mystryl and Kozah. If you give me a few minutes to recall my lore, I'm sure I can come up with a whole lot more tales of gods who really, really don't like each other," she said with a giggle. "But, even that could be a manifestation. It's hard to...Know something." She paused again, donning another pensive expression. Something tinted slightly with sorrow. Her heart was reminded again of what it was like to connect with her mother and know the depths of the heart of the other. The longing ache returned. But she kept quiet about it. "What about you?" she asked, looking at Ellesandra again. "I would say I looked up to my mom more than Silent Purity. Did you have anyone you looked up to, besides that nameless trainer who would probably crack their whip at you for doing something so heinous as, ah...Relaxing on a rooftop instead of practicing your flourish?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She snorted at the idea of the god fighting amongst itself in different forms. "Maybe the deity is just bored so creates conflict with itself. Fighting can be fun if you've grown up with it your whole life, a sport really." She knew many a person who enjoyed the art of dueling for the enjoyment over it more than the utility and use it had in guarding or fighting for something. The comment about cracking the whip was something she had to actively force herself not to react to. The scars on her back seemed to tingle at the thought. Oh, her trainer hadn't been the one to cause them, hadn't been holding the whip, but it was too close for full comfort. Shaking her head and those thoughts out of it, she considered who she might have looked up to. Besides 'that nameless trainer.' "Her name is Sia. I only called her ma'am or ser, though." A moment of silence after as she considered who else she may have looked up to. At least, looked up to and was still comfortable talking about. "There was a soldier I served with for a time, Aeras. He was a true believer in Torm, a paladin. The most honorable man I've met; he would tell it to you straight and still make you feel grateful for him giving you brutal honesty. Truly wanted to help people in the world, and thought hiding things from them or being anything but truthful was, in the long run, more harmful than telling them the truth. I don't know how he did it, tell someone to their face they were an asshole and somehow make them thank him for being honest and never feel defensive." She shrugged lightly. "Last I heard, he'd died in battle against some beast that was prowling the beaches near the outskirts of the Kingdom. I mourned his loss, and celebrated his memory during The Divine Death ceremonies."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star noticed the reaction. Of course she hadn't intended it, but...Well, that did confirm that, didn't it? She made a mental note to not bring that up again. "Sia? That's a nice name," she said, unable to view the stern mentor with the same instilled fear, respect, or whatever kept Ellesandra in line. Sia hadn't yelled at Star to demand she call them 'ser' after all. A passing comment, before Ellesandra continued. "Paladins have that way about them. I knew a paladin before, a paladin of Arshea. She was...Eccentric. But kind." Once more, just an anecdote, not wishing to linger on herself, wishing to focus on the other instead. "I'm sorry to hear of his passing. It sounds like your homeland lost a good soul. Perhaps not the most gentle one, but I get the sense from the people you describe as looking up to, you have a lot of respect for strong personalities like yours." She smiled, truly meaning it in a good way. "I can't say I blame you of course. It's inspiring to see someone face things with fearlessness, to command others with strength of conviction." She was mostly thinking aloud with this, but focused back on the point by the end. "Have you ever been a leader to other soldiers? I can tell you're well used to being part of an organized plan with how you fit in with the elves, though with how you always spoke in common to them it makes me suspect you missed the speech that was given in elvish before we left the grove."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Sia was a nice name. For a while, Ellesandra had considered it for a child's name, if she ever had one. She no longer considered having a child as an option, though; no more dreams of settling down with someone and raising a family. She nodded at the comment about Paladins and their seeming natural charisma. She nodded softly to herself, not letting her mind stray near the only 'gentle' person she'd looked up to or truly respected. She didn't exist, after all. "Leader? Oh, no. I don't have the desire or drive to command others; the ability to command respect like that. I've never desired to be able to do so, either." She paused, reaching up to run fingers through her hair and scratch at her scalp lightly, thinking back to her early teens. "I did serve as a squire to a knight on a brief campaign. It was just to take out some bandits on the outskirts, we weren't a Kingdom at war or anything. I started squiring when I was about ten, with the goal of becoming a Knight, of course. So I have experience marching with them, travelling and how an army functions overall." That was what she'd been calling upon during the march with the elves, and her tendency to follow command when given. "As for language - no I don't speak anything but maybe one or two words in elven I've picked up during my travels. I did join a few lessons in Sylvan growing up, enough I could pass for a basic conversation, but I wouldn't be able to hold anything in depth or get nuances in it." She hadn't been particularly good at that, and did not want to delve into those particular memories. Marigold had dragged her to the lessons because she wanted someone to be able to practice with; Ellesandra's interest had always been much more in Marigold and much less in the actual Sylvan language. The memory stirred up some of the guilt and pain, but she quickly focused her mind elsewhere. Pretending it didn't exist, after all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept an eye on the way Ellesandra's emotions flashed through their explanation, as she often did. Polite eye contact was maintained all the time, though that naturally came with the obvious consequence. Star idly wondered if Ellesandra might consider it more polite if Star didn't look at them. Just...At all. Weird thought to put away. She found it odd, and her face shows as much, that Ellesandra had no desire for leadership. But with some short consideration, she surmised her own answer to why that might be. She didn't want to push it. It was nice to be on the receiving end of them opening up, even if it wasn't anything terribly personal. "I speak a lot of languages. They come pretty naturally to me, so, if you ever need a translator, I'm your girl," she said with a bright smile, not having any judgement for Ellesandra's lack of desire to learn them. Only one of them needed to speak any given language to get around, after all. "Was there anything else you had to learn in part of becoming a knight? Maybe it's a given, but I assume you're at home on horseback. But I don't really know what else you might learn outside of combat. Surely there's some other facets to it, no?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't seem to notice Star's apparent thoughts. The eye contact did make her uncomfortable, in which she usually was not meeting it just from a habit of looking away while she spoke. The 'I'm your girl' comment made Ellesandra raise a single eyebrow at Star in amusement, but she didn't comment on it. Again, there would be no flirting with Star, even when Star made comments that left her wide open for it. Turning her mind back to her training, she sat up and took her empty mug, looking down into it as something to look at rather than the eye contact Star was making. "Well, fighting is an obvious one. Being able to put armor on and take it off quickly. Riding a horse, yes, as well as driving a carriage and wagon and such. Camp making, fires, setting up tents, how to live off of the gruel they serve when out on the road." She smirked at this, thinking back to some of the particularly bad meals that were served. Stew that was more water than anything else on particularly long trips. "Keeping an eye out while being on guard, how to sleep lightly to be woken easily but still get decent sleep. Along with that learning how to fall asleep almost instantly. Sometimes, you take the nap you can get. And then one specific to myself was studying some basic medicine; since healing magic didn't work well on me, I went out of my way to learn how to tend to wounds myself if I could."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star noticed the brow raise, then looked away. Did she say something weird? Truly, she was too innocent in the matters of the heart to know what she invited. Among more flirtatious company, she was utterly out of her depth and bullied to an inch of her face's ability to hold a blush. Moving on from that, she nodded to the mostly expected answers. "I noticed the medical training. I learned much of that myself from a few different mentors over the years; healing has always been a calling for me, though there's only so much I can rely on my magic for that. And I wouldn't use my sympathetic healing on just anyone unless it was critical." Something said casually, perhaps without thinking about how it drew the natural parallel to how eager she was to use it on Ellesandra. She kept going without notice of this however. "I commend you for your iron stomach. I would sooner live off the land than even think about some of the culinary masterpieces you must have experienced in your time in service.."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The sympathetic healing comment got her to look over at Star again curiously, eyebrows raised. She didn't call Star on it, on how much Star had wanted to use it to heal Ellesandra. It could just be that Ellesandra couldn't be healed easily with normal magic, so it was the main option for her. It could also be the supposed resonance between them, but she suspected it was something different. She pursed her lips for a moment, then turned to look out over the quiet night of the town again. "I would prefer to live off the land too, but when you're travelling in large groups that's not as much of an option. Additionally, just typical rations you can buy from the store would be too expensive for a large group over month's of travel, so you take what ingredients you do have and make it stretch as far as it can go. I understand why the food was like that, even if I didn't particularly enjoy it." She began rubbing at her shins beneath her breaches, happy it was a warm night because she would have been getting cold by now otherwise.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  If the two hadn't committed to two days of rest, Star might have been more eager to get back to bed to ensure she caught up on some lost sleep from recent days. But for all she cared she could sleep until four in the afternoon the next day if it meant she could stay up and have a moment that meant something with Ellesandra. Assuming the knight was true to their word and didn't feel the whole thing to be in jest, the two were to be together for at least a whole year. Not that Star gave a damn about the formality of 'hiring' Ellesandra, which was just a front to try and give them some money. Not that she'd admit as much freely. The knight was free to go any time as far as she was concerned but...She did want them to stay. She did notice the rubbing though. "You're not cold, are you?" she asked with idle concern. "We don't have to stay up here. Though I...Need to thank you for taking me up here. I feel better than I did...I hope you are having a good time here with me, too."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shook her head. "Oh no, I was just thinking it is nice that it is a warm night. Otherwise I might have been getting cold." She did look sideways at Star curiously though. 'a good time here with me, too.' Was Star flirting with HER? She eyed Star curiously for a moment, then shook her head and turned back out to watch the sea in the distance. "Well, I think I've done what I set out to do here. You wanted to know some more about me, I think that's three different stories of my past I've shared?" Oh, none of them even came close to touching the mountain that Star was actually curious about, but the empath would just have to take what she could get. This was more than Ellesandra had shared with someone for a long time, since the incident actually. "Glad it helped you feel better."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a smile at those words, nodding and glad to hear the knight wasn't cold or uncomfortable. "I like knowing more about you. Even the small things," she said, then giggled. "Hey, what's your favourite colour?" A silly question on the surface, but...Ellesandra had certainly seen how much importance colour had to Star and her powers. The swath of colours that surrounded her when she meditated demonstrated as much. "Mine is blue. Azure, actually. Like the sky."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Favorite color? She hadn't considered a favorite color in years. She was thoughtful for a moment, looking up at the dark, starry sky as if she could see the blue azure in it that Star had mentioned. Closing her eyes, she knew the answer she would have said just three years ago. It was no longer the same answer, though. The brief pang of loss only happened for a moment before she was considering a new answer to the question. Eventually, she reached up and ran a finger across the center of her own chest, where her armor would have been if she'd been wearing it. "Silver. I consider the sight of silver hopeful. Seeing armor and swords around me, the dull greys and the brighter, polished silvers all blending together. Torm's gauntlet on his symbol, I'm sure a lot of people might look at something like that and have fear if they've been on the receiving end of people who use weapons and armor to oppress or hurt. But I like the glossyness of it. The sun reflecting off of a breastplate, and.." She paused, reaching up and running a hand through her hair. Unnaturally silver, for someone so young. She'd had it ever since she could remember. "I've grown to enjoy my hair color. Makes me stand out, which is unfortunate, but also something I wouldn't give up."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled at the response. She was obviously happy with it. It meant more to Ellesandra than just 'I like it', namely. There was depth to the emotion. And Star was all about depth to emotion. It was strangely uplifting, enough to brighten her smile significantly. Though it might not be clear to Ellesandra, it was, to Star, an insight into the core of the woman. The place she cared most about. Indeed, it wasn't the actual answer that mattered, but more how much thought and meaning was behind the answer that had Star looking genuinely brightened. "You do have a nice hair colour. It's...Hm." She looked at Ellesandra's hair for a time, deciding how best to describe it. "...Well. I don't think you'd agree with what I think about it. But it's nice. It suits you. Brings out eyes quite well and compliments your complexion, and looks dashing in the ponytail you wear. Though, as close as it is, I prefer it when you have it down." There she went, light-heartedly going on about Ellesandra's beauty without a single moment of inhibition.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't sure why her answer had made Star so happy. She narrowed her eyes in confusion at the woman beside her, tilting her head to the side. Why did that matter so? Did her own aura have a lot of silver in it or something, that would explain the color choice? The curiosity to see her own aura rose, but she pushed it down. She knew she'd see something there that she did not want to see, and as much as she might pretend it wasn't there, she knew in the back of her mind it was. The weird comment about her hair made her tilt her head to the side and pull it over her shoulder, looking down at it. Was there something wrong with it? Then the casual comment on how dashing she looked made her snort. Star was so innocent and naïve she didn't even realize what she was saying could be interpreted as flirting. Another reason that Ellesandra shouldn't try anything with her; Star had indicated previously that she'd never been intimate with someone, after all. Ellesandra wasn't about to take advantage of that. "Well, even if I don't agree what you think about it, I'd love to hear it. Other than your flattering me there, which I don't think you meant as part of that statement since I've done nothing to imply I think I look less than dashing." Ellesandra knew she would be considered beautiful to some. She was fit, athletic, and had one of those rounder faces that many considered adorable. She hated her face shape a lot of the time, but it had it's benefits.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star giggled. "I'm not afraid of flattering you. There's plenty to flatter. But if you want to know what I truly think of it? When I think of seeing your hair blowing gently in the breeze while standing with the sun rising behind you, the only thing that comes to my mind to describe it is...Heroic." She redoubled her smile at that. Even if Ellesandra disagreed, it was how she felt. "Glad we can at least agree on how dashing you are, if nothing else, ehe.~"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra paused, turning to stare at Star and her giggling - flirting. Well, it might not actually be flirting, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. Confusion clouded her as she watched the mage next to her, eyes squinted and trying to determine her game. Was it just naivety and she was saying things she thought were true, but not with a goal behind it? That was most likely, but Ellesandra was doubting how true it was. After a moment, she decided to go with that anyways. Even if Star was actually flirting with Ellesandra, it was a bad idea to pursue anything there. Best to assume platonic and keep acting that way. Turning, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Heroic." She muttered, considering Star's image of her like that. "You're wrong." She reached up, rubbing at the base of her neck and staring into the night sky. She used to think she'd be heroic, some strong lady knight who would save the world. That was what she daydreamed about as a kid, even as a young teenager. She had no such fantasies any more. This was a job, the only thing she knew how to do and was good at. It was no longer a life long dream, but simply a way to survive. Taking a deep breath, she slapped her hands onto her thighs and then moved to stand, planning to effectively end their night out on the roof. "Well, I think I'm going to head in to bed. I'd feel more comfortable if you did as well, not just staying out on this roof where some shadow or pirate could assassinate you. Are you ready?" It was an obvious brush off from the topic of heroicism, and a potentially forced end to what Star might be considering a pleasant evening, but Ellesandra simply didn't have it in her to talk about herself any more. She was already stretched more than she had in a long time, telling the stories she had.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wore a smile even in the face of Ellesandra telling her she was wrong. "I did tell you that you wouldn't agree with me," she said, not fazed by the brick walls Ellesandra was busy laying mortar to build around herself again. She could see the complicated emotions that surrounded the notion swirling around on Ellesandra's aura. A hint of hopefulness at the word smothered by crushing waves of the usual other emotions. It wasn't difficult to understand; Ellesandra had shared at least the surface of what she assumed was the primary source of her pain. The life of growing up an orphan had given her a new nuanced understanding after this night. The envy. Seeing how much her own mother loved her had inspired it in Ellesandra enough to paint the picture that perhaps Sia wasn't the only one who was hard on the woman. It certainly explained why Ellesandra was so rigid. As if a whip would crack if she stepped even an inch out of line. And that, too, could very much be true. The mention of whips offhand had evoked a jolt from the knight's heart. What Star saw briefly...She might be brought to anger, if not for wanting to maintain a smile for Ellesandra. Her anger for the knight's past was there, no mistaking it. But it had its time. It had its place. This wasn't either. It was left to sit and bide its time, ready to one day showcase the rare side of Star. The angry one. The one that was capable of breaching her goals of pacifism to unleash her torrent of anger in admonishment of those who had wronged Ellesandra in her eyes. Perhaps an anger that would never have its outlet. Yet it remained true that she would not allow these wrongs to go without a proper verbal lashing given the opportunity. All of this was sequestered away, out of sight, out of her heart. It had no business souring this evening. "And while I don't expect if I elected to stay that I'd catch an arrow for my troubles, it's a good time to retire to bed all the same I think." One more smile before taking her empty mug again to be returned at some point. Then, she joined the knight back to their room so they could get a good night's rest.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star had, of course, been right. Ellesandra found that she usually was when it came to emotions, even if she didn't want to admit it. Glad that Star agreed to head inside as well, Ellesandra would take the mugs down to the innkeep to be washed with a polite thanks for allowing them up on the roof, then headed back up to their bedroom to go about getting ready for bed. She was already out of her armor, but her rapier was removed from her waist and laid against the wall right next to her bed. She didn't say much to Star, but instead slid under the covers and then turned her back to the other's bed. She hoped she wouldn't have one of the dreams which made her make noise in her sleep; usually when she did she woke up due to sleeping lightly, but even still. With most clients, they would listen when she shrugged it off and said she had a bad dream. She was pretty certain that Star would be able to see through it, see it as the ptsd flashbacks they were and push on that. And so, it was with this thought in her mind to push those previous dreams back that she let herself drift off to sleep.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star fell asleep facing Ellesandra, rather than with her back turned to them. She always did, when Ellesandra was near. Perhaps something to do with being able to see the other, reassure herself if needed with what she saw. An answer that could not be known without asking directly. But it all aside, Ellesandra was pulled into slumber deeper than their usual degree. A pull that was familiar by this point, one that forcibly dragged Ellesandra into those meetings with the shadow, where the waking world was lost to them. Except this time, Ellesandra found themselves standing on an immaterial black void. Lucidity possessed them. Aware of their dreaming state, able to think and act as they would in the waking world. They were clad in the same clothing they wore while sleeping. And within this void, there were three simple choices laid out before them. Two doors, and the boundary of the dark void. One door was black, with shadowy essence seeping through the gaps between the door and its frame. The other door was white with a golden handle with soft light shimmering from behind the door. The shadow, or the white ghost. A choice. And if neither was desired, Ellesandra could feel the soft embrace of surrendering their lucidity was just beyond the border of the dark void. A short walk, ignoring the doors, and regular dreams, perhaps infused with the flashbacks that plagued Ellesandra, were waiting if they were so chosen.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hated the feel of that pull. When she came to in this strange void like area, eyes darting around and taking in the two doors, and the temptation of regular dreams down the side path she cursed. "For fucks sake!" She spun, taking in all options around her and what it was like. Part of her wanted to just sit and waste the time of whatever was behind each door. What if she did that? That is, in fact, what she did. Instead of moving off to where she could feel the soft embrace of normal dreams, she moved to where she was just in front of the two doors, standing about as close to inbetween or in the middle of them as she could, and just plopping down on the ground, criss cross apple sauce. She leaned back, palms behind her on whatever served as 'ground' here, and stared at the doors. "If you want to come and fuck around with my consciousness and decisions, the least you can do is both come out of the damn holes you're in and have a group chat here. Maybe I can watch you kill one another, that'd be a fun dream. " Ellesandra was irritated at the constant invasion into her conscious. Star did it, though in her defense it wasn't intentional, but it was still an invasion to Ellesandra. And now she had two different beings doing it, not just the shadow? She didn't care if this white and gold, supposedly 'positive' and 'heroic' vibe was actually good or not. Even if they opposed this shadow, they were still trying to use Ellesandra like some pawn in their games, and she didn't appreciate that.
</p>

  Perhaps to Ellesandra's surprise, the doors each opened at the same time, slowly, at their words. Through the black door stepped the shadow. Through the white door, the white figure, though the white figure lacked the shimmering blue spot that it had the last time it had been seen. The black and white apparitions stared one another down for a moment, though how Ellesandra knew that when the apparitions did not have eyes was a curious notion. "As you wish," said the ever-enigmatic shadow. "Though I'm afraid you won't get the deathmatch you wish for."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh shit, Ellesandra had NOT expected them to take her up on her challenge. She stood up quickly, ankles rolling smoothly to stand up in one smooth motion and taking a few steps back to ensure there was enough distance neither being could lash out at her without her having an opportunity to defend herself. Yeah sure, Ellesandra probably had no chance going up against either of them, especially without her armor or weapon, but that didn't mean she was going to be reckless in her positioning. Her arms crossed and after the moment of surprise in which her eyes had widened, she looked between the two with a frown. "That's lovely. Deathmatch would be preferred, but instead why don't you two introduce yourselves? Or shall I call you shadow bastard and light bitch? Or maybe it's shadow bitch and light bastard? Whichever you all prefer." It had been a long time since Ellesandra had actually let her ire get this evident and been petty with names - probably since she was a teen. Yet she couldn't help herself; she held her irritation with Star's invasion of her emotional boundaries back due to recognizing it not being her fault, but these beings were fully in control of whether or not they stepped in on Ellesandra's consciousness like this. And Ellesandra was not a fan of powerful beings, deities or not, playing around with her or anyone else. After what happened to Aeras and how she had been told Torm had intended that for him, else would have protected him, she had said fuck you to all beings of power like such.

  "Until such time that your decision is cemented with action, there's no purpose in revealing ourselves," said the shadow. The white apparition paused a moment, then spoke in a refreshingly feminine voice, not veiled like the shadow. "Sapphire Trisfina," said the white being. "My name is Sapphire. I know you are wary of us. Both of us. I do not blame nor begrudge you for this. But I felt it only appropriate that if...They..." she said, gesturing softly towards the shadow. "Are going to address you in your dreams, and speak of my deeds, it only is fair that I stand to represent myself. But it is my belief that our influence ought not be forced upon you. So at any time, you may walk away, beyond the boundry, to find sleep again. I have asked...them...To only ever offer you passage to speak to them, but I cannot stop them from forcibly pulling you into a shared meeting if they will it." At least this time, it seemed the shadow was playing by the rules. If there was any reaction to Sapphire introducing themselves, the shadow didn't show it. Not that it had a 'face' to speak of to examine. Just a blank slate of shadow on its head.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra rolled her eyes at the shadow, but then turned to look at Sapphire as she introduced herself. An eyebrow raised at the mention of the shadow being they, and the rules she had set upon them. Looking back to the shadow, she glanced past it to the doors, then back to the two beings in front of her. "Sapphire, huh? So are you one of their little gem creations, emerald and ruby and all, that just decided to work against them or something? Or is that name just entirely coincidental?" The doubt dripped from her voice. She was now even more convinced that the shadow was just creating this fake 'light' force to manipulate Ellesandra with. Her lips pressed together in distaste at the idea, or at the idea of falling for it anyways.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "While I can't speak for them...I'd wager it was me that inspired them, not the other way around. I assure you, I am no creation. Born human, same as you, before eventually becoming what I am today," said Sapphire. The shadow responded: "The names of my thralls are from the gems seated inside them. And if Sapphire has introduced herself, then...Call me...Black Diamond."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Black diamond? Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at them, a little amused by that, but not commenting further on it. She could just spend this whole 'dream' poking fun at both of them and annoying them, or trying to, for invading her dreams but that wouldn't be very productive. If she wanted them to leave her alone, best to let them say what they wanted to say then tell them to shove off and deny participating in their little game. So instead, she nodded. "Okay, Black Diamond and Sapphire. Sapphire has the prettier name, sorry Blackey. No, Di - yeah, Die is the right nickname for you. Sapphy? no, Sapphic. So Die and Sapphic, what I get is that Die here wants me to leave Star alone so she doesn't continue her mission or gives up, whereas Sapphic here wants me to stay with Star and protect her during her mission. Not sure if your goal is to actually ensure she dies in it by keeping her on it, or protect her to help her complete it. What's the real reason you give a damn about this though?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There would be no reactions from either as the nickname convention rolled into town. They each acknowledged, somehow, the names they had been given. "It is my desire to see Star safe, healthy, happy, and reunited with Aurora. It was a tragedy that they were ever separated," said Sapphire. "Whether you stay to protect her or not, it remains my goal. If not you, then perhaps another," she continued, earning a response from Black Diamond: "And on and on and on in a relentless and futile pursuit. Sapphire could not stop Star's last guardian from perishing. So too will be your fate, Ellesandra." Sapphire did not respond to that, instead focusing on the question once more. "I need no reason to want to see someone happy and reunited with those that love them. But if that is not enough, it is true that the Lumina family holds a gift of great import. Their auramancy can only pass through the bonds of love; all those in the Lumina family have been paragons for peace. Aurora herself can, and indeed has, stand before an army and through words alone achieve a lowering of arms, a peaceful end to conflicts that never were given a chance to begin. Star is destined to achieve the same greatness in her years to come. Thousands upon thousands of lives may yet be saved by her, so it is worth a great deal to shield her. Can you not see it, too, Ellesandra? Do you not see the purity, the kindness of which I speak? The strength that exists within her to stop bloodshed between the most bitter of enemies before it could ever manifest, and to strike down evils of this and all worlds she travels," said Sapphire, her voice filled with hope and belief in Star. "All in service of continued, perpetual suffering," responded the shadow. "A slave. A puppet for the gods to do with as they please. Protected only for their usefulness. Speaking of defending life in one paragraph, only to justify murder the next. Nothing but pandering to soft hearts for their own ends. Arbitrary lines drawn to determine when they can send Sapphire to guard someone and when it is but the will of fate, or some other absurdity they get away with only because none challenge them." The shadow didn't really have emotion in their voice, and yet...It somehow still conveyed a sense of annoyance as it responded in kind to Sapphire.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked between the two, listening to Sapphic's comments about Star and Aurora. That was additional proof that Aurora was alive; Star would be interested in hearing that. And apparently Sapphic was some sort of guard for the gods, to protect someone for them? Die was apparently going that route, trying to lean on Ellesandra's hatred of how deities used people to further their own ends, but she shook her head at them, anger rising as they tried to take a moral highground to the deities. "While I agree with you the gods deserve to be challenged and put in their place, Die, you've lost any respect for morality when your own creation and protected puppet had his pirates capture Lissana. They were going to rape her, maybe they even did before we got there, I didn't want to press on that question. And then likely kill her, not to mention what I overheard them talking about when they found Star that first time. Your mission might be good, but your means aren't, and for that alone you can shove off. I may not follow Torm anymore, but I still believe in honor and integrity in one's mission. So take your door away from these dreams and don't approach me again." Her attention turned towards Sapphire, then. "Whether I tell them to shove off while protecting Star though, is not your decision. I've agreed to guard her for one year, that is the deal we have currently. I maintain full autonomy to tell her to shove off as well at the end of that year and abandon her wherever she is in her search at that time, if she has not completed it by then. I won't be your god's puppet, either."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Bold that you think you have any bargaining chips in this matter," responded Black Diamond. "You're still neutral to me in this. But rest assured, if you act in defiance of my warnings, it won't be you I kill." That ominous threat had somewhat obvious target behind it, though it remained spoken with cold neutrality. Sapphire spoke next: "Never was it that I or anyone else made you a puppet, Ellesandra. Black Diamond would have you believe I manipulated you, pulled the strings of everything behind the scenes to manufacture events. It is not so. That I had a hand in matters is true, yes. I had known of Black Diamond's presence in Cloverport, and I had known what information might lead Star and, at the time, Nina there. Nina was unfortunately assailed. But I knew Star would press given the chance. So it was. I ensured that Morrun was given a second wind of energy on the fateful night he observed those from Myst, where he might have otherwise returned to sleep. Thus, he had energy to continue what he wished to do. It led to his observation. Then, his excited words reached the mutual contact which had sent Star to meet him. I had hoped he would have chosen to meet at the grove, as it was safer, but such was not to be. Star then went to Cloverport. And when Black Diamond saw this, they saw fit to pull the strings more directly with the intent of scaring Star away. Then you showed up. Black Diamond would have you believe I aim to intervene in everything...But truly, I want nothing more than for each to live their own lives, happily, and in peace. It is they who pull strings directly and speaks in half-truths to sway others." Words from Sapphire which could not go without answer from Black Diamond, of course: "Decrying me a purveyor of half-truths while speaking a half-truth themselves; they have known of your resonance with Star from the moment you were both born and has been plotting you both meet from that very moment. She will not admit an iota of this truth, how if you were not born with such resonance surely she would have intervened and saved Marigold to spare you the suffering you now bear. She will insist it is a matter of non-interference, but could you truly believe someone who stood by and watched Marigold sacrifice herself for you, and stood idle? Just like all the other gods and goddesses of the multiverse. Action only when it suits them. You say my methods and means have become devoid of morality, yet opposing me are those who enforce their own selective morality and wield all the power necessary to enforce it only to dismiss any attempt to judge them or demand better of by hiding behind their age and power as reason to submit and be subservient. Such is my path; words have failed. Peace...Has failed. So it is war, for if none of them will listen to understand how much this and all worlds bleed, how much they all SUFFER...Then the only option left is to show them how much the world can suffer. Let them see it with their own eyes and hearts until they decide it is time to rise off their laurels and act against the evil of the world. Because it is entirely apparent that the current degree of evil, of suffering, is acceptable. So it falls to me to become the paragon of suffering, of sorrows, to force their hand to try and stop me. And if they will not stop me, I will slay all of them. I will become the god-killer and end their reign. And you are but a wandering knight who has stumbled into this war; I will not be told otherwise that my intervention to advise you to leave is a mercy. For if you stand against me, you invite the same suffering unto yourself that will make what you now feel be, when juxtaposed, utter paradise made manifest."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She had rolled her eyes at Die's attempt to threaten her, or Star, simply looking over to Sapphic as she spoke instead. That was when Die responded, and threw Marigold into the mix. Ellesandra's mood shifted immediately. Even without Star's power, the change was noticeable. Previously she'd been annoyed, irritated and frustrated at the both of them, though her dislike of Black Diamond had obviously been more than directed at Sapphire. After commenting about how Sapphire had simply stood by while Marigold died for Ellesandra so that she would eventually be able to meet Star and protect her? It took every ounce of rational thought she had left not to swing on Black Diamond. She rarely took to violence out of anger, usually just using the anger to simmer and fuel her in training or something like that. She had never started a drunken fight, though she'd definitely finished them before. The only time her anger had completely overwhelmed her to where she physically lashed out at someone was after Marigold's death, and her body took on the scars from that encounter. No, it was with the training Sia had given her to control herself and not attack someone rashly that she held back, but her demeanor went from annoyed and trying to annoy both of these beings back for being a pain in her ass, to outright fury. She didn't respond at first, glaring at Black Diamond, but then turning her eyes to glare at Sapphire too. Her mouth opened, then closed. She didn't even have words to express her anger; they would simply seem like the petty response of a mortal to these two, most likely. Instead, she turned and began walking off into the void. Sapphire could go fuck herself for all Ellesandra cared, she wouldn't intentionally go out of her way to help Sapphire's goals unless they were the same goals Ellesandra had on her own. Black Diamond, though? She would go out of her way to destroy any shadow of theirs she saw in their travels; and she had no doubt that Star would be willing to go along with that, considering the things they were capable of. If the option still existed of walking out of this forced dream and into her normal dreams, she was now taking it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Silence reigned from the two figures as Ellesandra stormed off. Neither stopped her. Neither said another word. The void of regular dreams soon consumed Ellesandra's consciousness. Lucidity left them. But there would be no time to dream left. Morning was upon them both, and Ellesandra would wake to see Star kneeling beside Ellesandra's bed with her hands holding onto the edge, eyes poking out just over her knuckles. Like a cat, she was just observing Ellesandra with curiosity and, indeed, concern. She wanted to touch Ellesandra, but she knew they didn't like that. How long was she just sitting there watching?
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra woke up quickly, eyes opening up and quickly scanning the room. Her first goal had been to ensure neither Die or Sapphic were somehow in the room with them, but then she saw Star first thing, just peeking over her bed and staring at her. The fury was still there, covering the pain and guilt that she hadn't even noticed while in the dream, but had come up at the mention of Marigold sacrificing herself for Ellesandra. She wasn't quite sure what to make of Star crouching next to her bed and staring at her like this, her eyes furrowing and jaw clenching, trying to work the fury out of herself so it wouldn't be directed at Star. Sure, Star could see it, but it didn't mean she had to deal with it. Instead of asking the obvious about why Star was there, Ellesandra rolled over to the other side of the bed to sit up and throw her legs over it, her back her companion. "Not talking about it." She didn't know if she had been speaking out loud during the dream, so maybe Star had heard some of what she'd said, or if it was just Star seeing the fury that had built up and the irritation that had been there throughout the night. Was the fury strong enough that it had covered up the pain and grief? She was trying to push that down too, not sure how sensitive or focused Star's sight could be on emotions like that. Instead, she tried to focus on the day; it was another rest day, something she was reminded of due to her muscles. They were not nearly as bad as they were yesterday, or right after killing the captain, but they were still sore. "Breakfast?" A topic redirect, to try to distract Star - as useless as that would be.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I assumed as much," came Star's reply. She rose up and took a seat on the edge of Ellesandra's bed at those words though, looking over her companion with sincere and deep concern. "...Can you at least promise me that you're okay?" Obviously Star could see that Ellesandra wasn't. But Star had come to recognize that Ellesandra tended to prefer it when she acknowledged the knight's strength. Recalling when Star herself had pushed herself beyond her ability to walk and Ellesandra allowed some amount of pride in the matter from her. Some amount of her refusal so long as she was able to keep walking. Of course, she knew that giving Ellesandra an out to not talking about things was going to be taken. But more importantly, Star wanted to know if that went far enough that Ellesandra would lie to her. She would be able to see the telltale flush of emotions that preceded a lie, subtle in some, obvious in others. Or even if it was just a dismissive, angry retort. She'd see that, too. "Then breakfast, yes."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't look at Star, even as Star asked to promise about being okay. She didn't answer, back to her for a few moments before standing up and going to grab her rapier, strapping it to her waist. It looked like she might not answer, though her emotions went through all the thoughts of whether or not she would lie to Star, or brush her off, or how she was going to respond. The fury was still there, and after a few moments she motioned for Star. "We can chat over food." Well, that wasn't a brush off, but it also wasn't an answer. Ellesandra was not going to tell Star why she furious, she would not go into that, but she would explain what happened with Black Diamond and Sapphire. This involved Star, after all. They were playing with Star's life and mission, and Sapphire again confirmed that Aurora was alive, which was news that Star certainly deserved. No need to go into what Black Diamond had said to infuriate her, but explain the dream? Star deserved that much at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could accept that much. She nodded, accepting a chat over food instead of belaying their hungry bellies. It would give Ellesandra time to cool off, too. She could see the fury as it intermingled the guilt. Each tried to overpower the other, but neither could win in this war. It was just a mess. Star was certainly not going to call anyone unreasonable for what was the equivalent of 'I need a minute'. So down they went to get some food, with Star following Ellesandra's lead.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra smoothed her shirt down. Really, she wanted to take some time in the shower and take advantage of having one to cool down, but she wasn't going to hold it off that long. Plus, they both needed food. So after running her fingers through her hair to untangle knots and pull it up in a ponytail, she would lead Star downstairs for breakfast. Finding a table that was relatively secluded from the rest of everyone, to prevent as much eavesdropping as possible, Ellesandra didn't say anything at first. A waitress would come by and Ellesandra would get just water and a basic breakfast platter, since most taverns didn't exactly have a lot of options for it. It came with eggs, meats and some fruits if the tavern was lucky enough to have them. She was silent as Star would order anything, and she didn't say anything at first. Like Star had assumed, she needed a moment to process. She didn't meet Star's eyes at all while they waited, eyes out on the tavern in the guise of keeping guard and watching for anyone who might be setting up to eavesdrop. Her fury had begun to subside, though it didn't go away entirely, and she'd mostly pushed the guilt and pain back into that unmentioned mountain. Her jaw was still tensed, and she was obviously going to be in a mood for most of the day, but by the time the food came she'd mostly let herself calm down enough that she could actually talk. She'd wait until the waitress left, before speaking, looking down at her plate rather than at Star. "The shadow visited me last night, along with someone named Sapphire Trisfina. Opposite sides of wanting you to find your mother, who Sapphire confirmed is still alive."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star just ordered the same as Ellesandra. She wasn't picky despite her preference and figured it was easiest for the chef at the inn to just make something by rote. Easy and filling. They could portion out who got what once it arrived if they so wished. Star was fine to just let the silence linger for a while, but it seemed there was news. Big news. The moment Ellesandra said this Sapphire woman confirmed her mother was still alive, Star's eyes shot open wide. Tears welled in them. Her lips fell just ever so slightly apart. A dumbstruck, paralyzed look overtook her. She had no words in the immediate. Just a shocked expression as she was flooded with more emotion than she knew what to do with. Which for her, had to be a lot.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't panic or do anything to break Star out of the thought and emotion that overwhelmed her at the statement. Instead, she moved the chosen fruit entirely off her plate over onto Star's while she was dumbstruck, then sat her plate down in front of herself. A sip of water was taken, before she began eating. It might be noted that Ellesandra didn't split Star's breakfast meat or take it, but just gave her fruit. Either way Ellesandra was silent, only glancing at Star briefly, and just letting the news sink in for a few moments and for Star to wrap her head around it. Finally, she added. "This Sapphire person seems to be a servant of the gods, in some way, whereas Black Diamond - that's what the shadow calls themselves - is wanting to kill the gods. They are also the one who was behind the pirates and their power. Anyways, Sapphire wants to see you complete your mission of reconnecting with your mother, and that's apparently on behalf of the gods. So, she's alive and the gods are in your favor in regards to you two meeting up again." Slices of the information in digestible, small chunks. That was what Ellesandra was going for; letting the initial shock of her mother being alive settle before releasing the information that the gods actively wanted her to reconnect to her mother.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star seemed so wholly fixated on the reality that her mother was alive still that she didn't seem to really process the other information given to her. Gods this, war that, it didn't matter to her. "A-Alive.." she finally said. And then came the tidal wave. Relief hit her like a rock from a catapult and she lowered her face into her hands. She trembled and, quietly as she could, sobbed into her palms. The nonchalant manner in which Ellesandra carried on was not at all matched. It meant the world to her to hear this, and whether or not Ellesandra realized it was a catalyst to galvanize her. She had said previously she might not want to know, but here in the face of the information, she was certainly having a positive, if strong, reaction to knowing the truth. Still, it looked like she might need a minute herself. Or might need such a long minute that her food would grow cold before she was centered again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well if there was one way to get rid of all of Ellesandra's fury, it was to see Star break down like that. She hadn't expected that strong of a reaction. She stared at Star for a few moments, before pushing out of her seat and moving around to Star's side of the table. She was gentle, kneeling down next to Star on her side of the table, and reaching out with her left, good arm to wrap it around Star. Once again, as Star began to break down, Ellesandra turned her head and allowed Star to use her shoulder to cry on, to get that physical comfort that Ellesandra knew she needed and wanted. Once again, Ellesandra prepared for the onslaught of emotion that she knew would come through Star's connection to her. Even with her barriers up, she knew that she'd receive a large blast of emotion from the woman and she braced herself against it as soon as she had reached out to touch her. Either way, though, Ellesandra would offer that comfort, the willingness to just wrap her arms around Star and hold her while she recovered. In hindsight, doing this over breakfast, in public, wasn't as good an idea as Ellesandra thought. She'd assumed Star would respond like Ellesandra would have, and that was so, so wrong.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Truly, it had been off the mark. It was the biggest news Star had received in a long time. So when Ellesandra touched her, their two auras resonated together and the crushing waves of mixed relief and sorrow and urgency and a thousand other frantic emotions bombarded Ellesandra's heart all at once. As always, Ellesandra was not forced to feel these emotions herself, but rather the emotions were bared to them to know. The empathetic connection made it so the knight could know all of what was in Star's heart to the degree their connection permitted. Resisting it didn't stop the emotion, though it wasn't pointless either. It just wasn't enough to stop it all. Just enough to take the edge off it all and blunt the feelings a small amount. Star leaned into the knight. She took the comfort. She took all they could give her while slowly finding her way to serenity again. It would take some time, and draw some wandering eyes from the inn, but otherwise proceeded without incident until such time that Star was able to sit upright again and draw in slow, measured breaths. In, out, in out...All just to try and calm down again. She would need to be reminded that she even had food in front of her; there was no guarantee she would be able to even eat in the wake of what was truly monumental news.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was patient, doing her best not to pry in on Star's emotions. Yeah emotions were bared to her and available, but Ellesandra made a concerted effort not to focus on those. Instead, she looked away while holding Star, glaring down anyone who was looking their way for too long, and simply letting Star feel the emotion. It wasn't until Star began to pull away and sit upright again that she moved away, a silent sight of relief coming as the contact stopped and the pure overwhelming plethora of emotion was no longer bearing down upon the knight. She didn't say anything else, but instead pushed Star's plate directly in front of Star's face again to indicate she needed to eat, while moving to begin eating herself. She paid no mind to the food being cold, if it was. She also didn't say anything else, recognizing that Star had experienced much more from that news than Ellesandra had expected. She wasn't sure how long Star might need to recover from that, considering the immensity of her emotions. That was more emotion than Ellesandra ever let herself feel, but also Star was better at processing and feeling emotions than Ellesandra was, so she really had no idea what it would take to get Star back down to normal. It had been good news, right? There had definitely been sorrow there, but she wasn't sure why that would have been sad news. Maybe it was sorrow at being separated? Or the sorrow from the grief and anxiety of what might have happened? She didn't know.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The food hadn't gone cold quite yet. Lukewarm, yes. But even as it was pushed in front of Star, she just...Looked at it initially. She knew she had to eat, but how could she do anything except rise up and charge onward? Of course that was a foolish plan. She didn't even know really where to go besides this lead they were following. And what if her fervor cost her her only chance to get to Myst, then to her home? She couldn't. Even more so, now that she knew her mother lived still. She couldn't risk it. She needed to calm herself, but the knowledge came with the double-edged blade in reinforcing that she could no longer delude herself by thinking nobody was waiting for her. Her mother was waiting. And now she was pouring over every decision she'd ever made. How much time had she wasted? How much closer could she be in this moment if she just kept pushing onwards? From Ellesandra's position, she just looked like she was a million miles away. She was there, but she wasn't present.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star didn't eat, and just stared at her food, Ellesandra reached over so her hand was in front of Star's face, and snapped to get her attention. "Hey." Her voice wasn't the gentle, encouraging voice Star would probably use in this instance. Something to ease someone out of shock and into the right actions. No, Ellesandra's voice was sharp, cutting to get her attention; the command of someone who was telling someone to listen, not requesting it. "You need to eat. You are no good to your mother or anyone else if you don't take care of yourself. Which includes continuing to take today to recover from your magic expenditure; we agreed two days rest here, and today is the second day. Then we'll head off to search for these traveller's from Myst. We have a plan, even if it's not going to be fast. All we have to do is keep moving forward as planned. But to do that, you have to eat, and drink, and rest." Ellesandra didn't know what was going through Star's head, and how close she'd been to exactly those concerns. If she had, she would have phrased it differently, commanded Star not to be rash and run off. But instead, she was emphasizing that Star couldn't forget to practice self care in her attempt to find her mother; she'd get herself killed that way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  As emotional as Star was, she had proven multiple times that she was capable of being rational and thinking things through. Even when it seemed she was acting rashly, she had thought things through. That she was so highly emotional was, perhaps contrary to what most expected of her, precisely why she was able to stay calm and stay logical when she needed to. So she did snap out of it when Ellesandra spoke to her. She looked at them. She nodded gently. And with rather noticeably trembling hands did she set about eating. Slowly, but...She ate. Out of necessity, not enjoyment. Normally so thoughtful and deliberate in her actions, she had been reduced to a woman acting on little more than instinct.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
This was outside of Ellesandra's expertise. How to handle Star was something Star would have been good at, and Marigold. Ellesandra was never good in situations like this. So, she didn't say anything else, just keeping an eye on Star as she ate to make sure she was eating and not about to bite her own finger or something like that because she wasn't paying attention. Ellesandra again regretted saying this over breakfast and not in their room, but it was too late now. How was she supposed to have known it would have that level of effect? On the positive side at least, Star was entirely distracted off of Ellesandra's emotions and how she'd woken up. So, unless Star said anything, Ellesandra let the breakfast go by in silence, sipping on her water and keeping an eye out on any pirates or anyone who was looking over at them with distaste or hatred. The crying had obviously brought some attention earlier, and she wanted to ensure that it hadn't brought any negative feelings or looks from anyone. The last thing Star needed right now was someone to comment something rude to her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There hadn't been a single pirate in sight since the captain had been slain. Just regular city-goers. Some who showed concerning looks for Star, but were swiftly dissuaded as it being none of their business with one glare from Ellesandra. It wasn't long before as far as anyone else was concerned, the two weren't even there. Privacy was secured, at least. Star finished her food without a single word. She had found comfort being near Ellesandra, and that comfort was keeping her together. But this was not the same Star from the morning. Not the cute, sweet girl who could stand up even to Ellesandra in stubborn defiance. She was now a girl who was...Overwhelmed with the world and all that weighed on her shoulders. Not terribly unlike Ellesandra, the difference being that Star was allowing her feelings to flow through her instead of simply pretending she hadn't heard what Ellesandra said.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let the silence go on, and when they had finished their meals she collected their plates and stacked them so they would be easy for the waitress to get. She also placed payment on the counter, but didn't stand from the table, sitting there and watching Star. The waitress came by to check on them, and Ellesandra ordered two hot cocoa's again. This was odd, being it was the morning and those were usually a snack at night - cocoa wasn't cheap or easily accessible for a lot of people. Her having ordered a cup for them both last night was likely seen as a type of luxury for a special occasion, but doing it again this morning? Still, everyone in the inn had seen Star break down earlier, and if that helped soothe her, Ellesandra would do it. "We don't have to go up to the roof, if you don't want to. But take it back to the room and let it warm you some while you go through..." Ellesandra waved at nothing around Star. She couldn't see Star's aura, but she figured Star would know what she meant. Even if Ellesandra couldn't see and read Star's aura, she knew it was there and knew Star had a lot of emotions going through her right now. Obviously, Star would be better at processing said emotions than Ellesandra, and she just wanted to give the tools necessary to help where she could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was, perhaps frustratingly, still silent even as Ellesandra went along and tried to provide comfort in the way of hot cocoa. Star acknowledged the mug with her eyes, but it was again something that she didn't seem keen on diving into drinking. Still. It had an effect, just because it was Ellesandra being thoughtful. They were trying. Star didn't want it to seem like she was ungrateful for their efforts, of course. So she at least took the mug in her hands and slowly stood, electing to move to the room rather than the roof. She wanted to retain the memory of the rooftop as it was, not complicate it with another memory so soon that was so much sadder. So without another word from her, she moved to the room, to her bed, and just...Sat, like a statue, as she worked through whatever it was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected it to make her automatically better. Unlike Star, Ellesandra was horrible in regards to handling people with heavy emotions. She knew Star enjoyed the physical touch comfort, which had been shown previously. Beyond that, the only thing Ellesandra knew to do was something that she herself would have appreciated in that situation. Just the comfort of hot cocoa and the ability to get away from things. As Star took it and just sat in their room with it, Ellesandra began going about her day in the room. She gave Star space, not pressuring her to talk or snap out of her feelings right now. After all, this was a rest day, and if Star needed to take the day to process emotion, then who was Ellesandra to stop her? What Ellesandra did do was some small exercises, working to test her muscles again after the haste spell and push them to see how much endurance she'd gotten back from the resting. She was gentle, not going too far with anything, and if Star did pay any attention she would notice Ellesandra never put too much pressure on her right arm or shoulder, for obvious reasons. Ellesandra was comfortable letting the day pass in silence, but she did make sure to stay in the room with Star, not go out wandering or anything. Even if Star wasn't in the state she was now, Ellesandra was her guard.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star had remained silent through the day. It didn't seem to help her much. She watched Ellesandra from the sideline of her bed. She sipped tentatively at her cocoa. She got up to tend to necessities when she had to. She occasionally shifted her posture. For an hour she looked to be napping. A few attempts to meditate ultimately seemed to fail. She noticed how Ellesandra could not put weight on their arm, idly thinking about the time Ellesandra had carried her. Was that overly strenuous for them? She couldn't know without asking, though she obviously noticed the pain in the woman whenever there was pain to be seen. Thoughts that she sought answers for in her hot cocoa, only to be disappointed by the lack thereof. If Ellesandra had no intentions of breaching the silence, neither would Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Carrying Star hadn't been painful, only because the weight had been positioned onto her back and legs. If she'd had to lift Star up with her right arm, that would have been painful - and weak and shaky. Sure it had put some straight on her shoulder, but as most of the injury was in the arm itself, not at her shoulder, it had been fine. The day went by without speaking, since Star didn't say anything else. Ellesandra lay in bed after her exercise, letting her body recover, then had gotten back up to clean her rapier and do the basic maintenance tasks needed on her weapon and armor. She spent the day comfortably in the silence, only occasionally glancing back over at Star to check in and see that she was still there and not sobbing or anything like that. Occasionally, she met Star's eyes and gave her a silent nod, just to let the woman know she was still here and supported, but if nothing else, she would let Star take the first shower and then would follow suit afterwards. It wouldn't be until they were both preparing and winding down to bed, after eating food and all, that Ellesandra would speak up. "So we're going to go look for the travelers from Myst, tomorrow." A statement, and confirmation of their plan.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The plan and its confirmation was met with just a simple nod. Star had her hot cocoa still. It was long, long since empty. So it was just the mug. But she had been holding onto it through the day, not unlike she had held onto the handkerchief Ellesandra had given her. It was time for bed now, though, so she did relent and leave the mug on the table. The day's work was done, though Star had noticed Ellesandra had always been proper in returning the dishes and ensuring the staff had as easy a time as possible cleaning up. There was some amount of comfort she needed from the mug. But it seemed she had gotten what she needed. It would either stay there until morning to be carried down as the two were heading out, or though Star wouldn't stop Ellesandra if they did choose to bring the single mug back down before bed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced at the mug, but she wasn't going to take it down and bother the staff with it that evening. Plus, if Star needed it throughout the night, for whatever odd comfort it brought her, why take that away from her? No, instead Ellesandra nodded to her. "Good night, Star. Tomorrow we'll set out, if you're ready." She added that last bit as a reassurance that they didn't HAVE to set out tomorrow. If Star needed more time, she could take it - and Ellesandra would still be there with her, guarding her. She would be receptive if Star said anything, but otherwise would lay in bed, facing Star's bed, and close her eyes to drift off to sleep - hopefully without irritating or infuriating gems haunting her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"Good night, Ellesandra," she said in turn, offering a faint smile. She would be awake for a while, but sleep would eventually claim her. Ellesandra's sleep was, perhaps predictably, met with the familiar pull to lucidity. A return to the dream state of the previous night. But just like before, it was not forced upon them. Seemed that Black Diamond had taken the 'rules' set in place by Sapphire seriously. Enough that Ellesandra was given the choice once more. To go into one of the doors, to goad them both out again perhaps, waste everyone's time some more, or just walk to the void beyond and have a regular dream.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra cursed again when she felt herself pulled into the lucidity and staring at the two doors. She was about to turn away and start walking into the void, when a thought struck her. Sapphire obviously knew something about Star's mom. How much? Did she know enough Ellesandra could share with Star, make her feel better? Would sharing any information actually make her feel better? Considering she'd expected the information from last night to help and encourage her, make her excited to continue on, and instead it had made Star break down and cry, Ellesandra wasn't sure. She honestly wasn't sure why Star had responded the way she had. If Ellesandra got news that Marigold had survived - despite seeing her killed in front of her own eyes - Ellesandra wouldn't have been crying. She'd have been taking action, immediately either making plans or acting on plans to go find her, at least to apologize. She closed her eyes to that thought as the guilt and pain surged, but then turned and headed towards Sapphire's door. She opened it, and took a step through, looking around warily as she did so.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The white door opened to reveal a beautiful garden of flowers and thriving nature. A waterfall descended into a still pond in this clearing, and Sapphire stood just off to the side of the pond. Except Sapphire was not just some formless white blur now. She was...Herself. A woman about five-foot-seven with brilliant platinum hair and ocean-blue eyes. Features that closely resembled Star in colour, though that is where the similarities ended. Sapphire's features were sharper, first. Her hair also was styled into two long ponytails off either side of her head. She was clad in a spotless white silk dress. Bare feet rest easy on the soft earth below. But more than anything...Two large, brilliant white wings featured extending off her back, folded for the moment. Sapphire was an angel. "Unexpected but...Pleasantly so, to see you, Ellesandra. What can I do for you?"
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took in a moment to take in the wings and realize what Sapphire was. She really was a servant of the gods, wasn't she? Ellesandra immediately regretted her choice to come in here, but pressed her lips firmly together and crossed her arms. A brief glance was given to the rest of the area, seeing the flowers and waterfall, and thinking that Star would love to visit this place. Unfortunate that it was Ellesandra visiting, who would be too distracted with displeasure at Sapphic to actually enjoy any of this. "My what great wings you have Sapphic, all the better to fly away with?" She retorted immediately. It was childish, and Ellesandra immediately regretted it, but there was still an ounce of that fury that came back from the previous night. She shook her head, taking a deep breath, and tried again. "What can you tell me about Star's mother? Star deserves to know if she's doing well, safe and not captured or something." If she was captured and being held hostage or something, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could share that information with Star. She should, theoretically, but Ellesandra was afraid of how Star would react in that case. But if Aurora was fine, safe, healthy and not in danger at all - would that help Star? Or would that just upset her more that Aurora hadn't come for her? She didn't know, but felt like she needed to ask at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire's brows rose in a strange look at Ellesandra's response. She'll just...Pretend she didn't hear that. When the natural questions followed, she steepled her fingers together before her and paused for a moment to answer the question with a question, much in line with what Ellesandra already thought. "What would you hope to do with that information? If Aurora is well, do you not think a woman of such deep compassion and strength would have come for Star again? It is her own daughter after all. I know that if I had become separated from my daughter, all nine layers of hell would not stand in the way of bringing me back to her." Sapphire gave a sympathetic smile. It answered the question, just not directly. It was bad news, it seemed. "Is it that you've shared the knowledge that Aurora lives with Star, and she does not know how to handle it? I want to help. But I hope you can recognize that...Some information can do more harm than good. Perhaps any further revelations can wait a week. At least long enough for you to reach Myst, if not Gurhal. But I leave it up to you. We want the same end result, I believe. Star and Aurora reunited. Both happy and healthy."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. "Just because she's well, doesn't mean she has full access to her magic. Maybe something happened to it, or is blocking her. Yes, I told Star what happened, and no she did not take it like I expected her to. But I'm also not just going to hide pertinent information. If Aurora is being held hostage by a specific group of people, it's important that I at least know that so I know who and what to look out for. If they are going to be holding Aurora active, they may be looking to capture Star the same way." She honestly didn't know if she'd tell Star, even if she thought Star would deserve to know. But, she was certain that it was better for her to know, at least. She needed to know what situation they would be walking into.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire gently nodded. "As you wish. As you suspect might have been possible, Aurora is being held captive. One of the lesser minions of Black Diamond keeps her imprisoned. You already were introduced to her greater minions, I believe you mentioned. Emerald and Ruby and Onyx. Not their real names, I'm sure you may have surmised. Neither is Black Diamond the true name of that person." Sapphire clearly knew much more about Black Diamond than she was sharing, but it was clearly purposeful. Just as this dreamland was changed to be a matter of choice, there was some sort of mutual respect given back to not reveal things about Black Diamond that they themselves did not reveal, and so did Sapphire stick to particularly neutral language on the matter. "But I digress. There are not one, but two forces who will be hostile to you should they learn of your intentions. The first is simply the Cult of the Black Diamond. Fanatics of the very same shadowy person who stands opposed to me. The others are known as the Apostles of Faust. If you embarked on this journey a few years ago, they would be neutral, perhaps. But there exists now a tenuous alliance between these two groups. I'm sure Black Diamond will send their greater thralls after you as well, though I would not expect the greater thralls to engage you in direct conflict most of the time. They act in clandestine ways more than direct confrontation. Ultimately, it is the Cult of the Black Diamond who has Aurora in captivity. Though, unfortunately the 'where' of that is beyond even me. But I'm sure you're capable of being convincing enough to figure that part out in time."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded. She was glad to have asked, at least. Knowing that there were other of Black Diamond's minions out there, and that if she sensed one again - would she sense them again? - it may be worth investigating safely to see if Star's mother was there was important. The information regarding the the Apostles of Faust, an organization she hadn't heard of before, was also useful and something to keep an eye out for. "Well, Sapphic, I appreciate the information and will keep an eye out for both groups during our travels. One more question, will these doors begin appearing every night or is this going to be a special circumstance situation?" For some reason, the idea of them appearing during special circumstances was even more annoying to her. If they were just consistently there for her to choose to go to or not, that was one thing. But if they were going to be sent as a sign that one or both of them wanted to talk to her? That would get annoying, fast.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was something about Sapphire's face that suggested she found the nickname she was given mildly amusing. A little tug of her lips each time Ellesandra said it. Otherwise her posture was neutral; a calm stance with hands folded before her, left over right, which displayed her gold wedding band and diamond engagement ring on her left hand's ring finger. She nodded to the thanks. "It's my intention to come to an agreement with Black Diamond that we both cease. When you get to Myst, it will, for reasons that involve high level arcana that I would not wish to bore you with, be impossible for either of us to present ourselves in your dreams. And when you get to Gurhal, it will become possible again, but...At that point, Black Diamond has stated that is where they will consider you their enemy. So I can see the only purpose to continue to appear to you would be to torment you. It's my intent to prevent that. But rather than decide what is best for you, I'd rather you tell me. Do you want to maintain a line of contact to one or both of us? Would you prefer to be left alone entirely? I can make no promises to the conduct of Black Diamond, as they have a proclivity to be...Clandestine and insidious. I can only promise to do all I can to keep them away from you, if such is your desire. I don't promise perfection but...Most nights, at least, should be free of influence." A few subtle implications came with the explanation, perhaps most notably being that this powerful angel was either equally matched, or perhaps at a disadvantage in power against Black Diamond. Clear enemies, and yet neither seemed capable of defeating or fully controlling the other. And somehow, Star and Aurora, and now Ellesandra, were caught between them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra ignored the obvious amusement from Sapphire at the nickname. The fact she was amused might imply she was actually sapphic, which was neat. It was also just amusing, overall. "An agreement with that being? Count me out of it. The only agreement I'd get in with them is my rapier through whatever counts as a throat for them." They were sure they hadn't seen Black Diamond's true form at all, so it was just going to be a matter of finding them eventually. Hearing that they would both be leaving her alone while in Myst was reassuring; perhaps their time in Myst itself would be relatively safe, if Black Diamond couldn't have much hold or sway there. Oh, that didn't mean they wouldn't encounter other dangers natural to Myst, but at least they wouldn't have to worry about these two beings fucking with them at all. At the idea of them being considered an official enemy of Black Diamond, she shook her head. She should already be considered that, but she wasn't going to say that and encourage them to attack before they got to Myst. "Perhaps you continue giving the choice each night. If you do that, it might encourage them to not just step into my dreams forcefully like they have in the past." She wasn't sure, but she was willing to bet if she refused to have that choice and just always go to normal dreams for the rest of time, eventually Black Diamond would invade them. But if she left that choice open, she was forcing Sapphic to also be present potentially, and which might dissuade them from doing anything shady. or maybe not, Ellesandra really didn't know.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire gave a difficult expression at the mention of Ellesandra putting their rapier through the throat of Black Diamond. "Were that all it would take," was all she had to say in response to that. Quiet, and somber. Not very fitting for the bright angel standing before Ellesandra indeed. "If you wish to retain the choice, then it shall be so. Keeping it that way is likely to keep Black Diamond more passive, and should they decide to be waiting in front of their door, I can be there as well to keep them in check." Just as Ellesandra had surmised, keeping Sapphire close would have its benefit at least insofar as countering the shadowy counterpart. "And of course, I can remain available to you, should you need or wish to speak on any matters. I know that Black Diamond has already tried to turn you against me, and will continue to do so. I can't ask you to trust me, but I hope to earn that in time all the same."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"That would work perfectly then." Her plan of using the apparent rival between these two to get some semblance of privacy and peace for herself was apparently a good one. She nodded to herself, considering it, and wondering if she could just chill in the 'waiting room' of whatever dream this was rather than going into her normal dreams, too. Would that be a way to avoid the nightmares she had? It might be worth testing, but she didn't want to ask that. It would be too vulnerable, with some angel she didn't trust. "Sapphic, all offense intended, I won't be a servant of the gods like you, and won't trust you fully because you are. Our goals happen to align right now, so I'm comfortable working together. But I won't trust you are making suggestions or acting of your own will. Black Diamond is an ass who needs to be stopped, but they aren't wrong. Gods can roll over and die for all I care." There was a small semblance of pain in the statement, but it was mostly repressed anger. Anger that she'd not let herself show when it happened because she'd been surrounded by people who followed Torm and were happy to continue to serve him, but how her faith in him - and thus, other deities - had been utterly crushed. This had only been reinforced with what happened with Marigold, and what happened after. Her eyes flashed at the idea of being used by the gods, but the only thing she could do was do what she thought and felt was right in the moment. If it happened to align with what the gods wanted, that was unfortunate but whatever. But she would not be brought out of her normal acting for them, not again. "Is there anything else, or am I free to go back to normal dreams now?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "That remains yours to decide," responded Sapphire, showing a sympathetic expression as Ellesandra declared there could not be trust between them because of her service to the gods. "I am here to answer your questions and offer guidance only if you ask for it. I know how hollow it will sound to you, but I do genuinely want you to walk your own path and support you in that. But that aside, if you have any other questions, ask them. Else...I won't hold you from your slumber."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waved her hand. "No other questions. Have a good...whatever for you." She was going to say have a good night, but did Sapphire sleep? If she was always here while Ellesandra was sleeping, was that because she didn't need to sleep? Or was she just awake at the times Ellesandra slept? Questions she didn't really care to have an answer for. Turning, she would move back through the door, and if needed, walk off into the void, hoping that her nightmares would not come afterwards, and that the brief spike in rage wouldn't have woken Star at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Just as the nights before, there were no regular dreams on the nights the conversations transpired. Even the short conversation seemed to take Ellesandra from night to morning. Perhaps there was time between that just wasn't remembered. Either way, the morning came to find Star already up, showered, and sitting on her bed with a look of passive impatience, if the idly tapping foot was anything to go by. She looked ready to go.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra woke up, blissful in not having had nightmares, and slowly moved into a sitting position. Her eyes trailed over to Star, who was tapping her foot and looking like she had been ready to leave for the past hour. Was that because she was feeling particularly rushed, now that she knew her mother was alive? Or had Ellesandra slept in more than she'd expected to? "Mornin'." She said softly, reaching up to rub at her eyes for a moment before standing and stretching. Her muscles were still sore, but it was minimal now; the kind you got after a decent workout, and could easily be worked through. It wouldn't effect her performance at all. Another glance was given to Star already being ready. "I'll be quick." She commented, grabbing a change of clothes and stepping into the bathroom to just change into fresh clothes and do basic morning hygiene rituals. She didn't shower, as they would just be getting dirty throughout the day anyways and she'd showered last night. She stepped back out, changed and moving to put her armor and such on afterwards. "Did you sleep alright?" Trying to make casual conversation, for the pure purpose of judging how well Star was doing today compared to yesterday.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star flashed a smile at Ellesandra when they said they would be quick. Looking out the single window in the room would reveal that it was barely dawn. It was early. Earlier than either of them would normally be up. About the only way Star could hope to be up before Ellesandra. A situation that was made clearer when the knight asked if Star slept okay, earning them a small shake of her head. She said nothing further on the matter, content to just answer the question with a negative. She didn't have bags under her eyes or any visible signs of fatigue, so despite not sleeping well she was well and clearly awake at least.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The shake of her heard and lack of response concerned Ellesandra for her companion. She continued putting on her armor, but moved to stand in front of Star as she did so, buckling straps mostly by habit and memory without looking at them, and instead looking at Star directly. "Star, if there is something you need to say or talk about, do so. I'm comfortable with silence and am happy to travel in silence with you today or however long it takes you to get out of this.." She paused, waving her hand. Emotional state sounded demeaning, but she wasn't sure what else to call it. "Headspace you're in" That worked, right? "But if something is wrong or bothering you and you don't want to just be silent, then it's open." It was probably odd, Ellesandra inviting Star to share when Ellesandra herself absolutely refused to do so. There was an important note here though - she was offering this if Star was wanting to share. There was no pressure to do so if she didn't want to. Ellesandra of all people knew that sometimes it was best - or it felt best, even if it wasn't - to process silently, take some time to yourself, but that didn't seem to be how Star handled things. It hadn't been up to this point, anyways.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked up at Ellesandra from her seated posture and just...Stared at them for a moment. There was some measure of recognition for the disconnect. Sure, the offer was a passive one. But the way Star looked at the knight still suggested she found the offer a little...Unfair on some level. Not enough to say anything. Just enough to show a rare flash of upset before it melted into a sigh through her nose as eyes closed. "...I'm just coming to terms with the realities that either I wasn't important enough to come looking for, or the news that my mother is alive comes with a big caveat that something awful has happened to her. Neither of those realities is easy to bear. I just want to get on with this. I know you wouldn't have let us leave yesterday, so I'm just waiting with all the patience I can muster until we're ready to get a move on." Just as Star had said in the past, the knowledge that her mother was alive had changed things. Her expedience was multiplied tenfold. It was giving her tunnel vision. There was a good chance if they ran into another Morrun and Lissana situation where they needed help, Star might not offer it as she pursued her goal with a redoubled, galvanized fervor.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ah, decisions decisions. Should Ellesandra tell her? If Star was looking, she'd probably even see the confliction of wanting to be honest with Star, and not hide anything that didn't have to be hidden, but also concern for Star and her state of mind if she shared the news. She was silent while Star spoke, explaining her attempt at patience, and finished putting her armor on. The rapier was added, then the knife strapped into it's sheath just beneath her armored skirt. Lastly, she ensured everything was in her pack, then threw it over her good shoulder before sliding her right arm through the strap as well. When she finished, she turned to look at Star with a serious expression on her face. "Star, it's...the latter. I'm not sure how awful, if she's being treated well, but I do know that she doesn't have a choice in the matter of her coming to you." She paused, considering if she should share who had captured her, but she'd come this far, hadn't she? Might as well reveal the whole truth. "The shadow I spoke of, who apparently uses the name Black Diamond, has her hostage." The words were said softly, knowing that Star wouldn't like them. It was one of those things that, unlike Aeras, Ellesandra was not good at. Aeras could deliver devastating news like this and somehow make someone focus on the silver lining, that Aurora was still alive and could be rescued. Ellesandra didn't know how to do that, but she couldn't just keep that a secret from Star. Maybe it had been foolish to ask, thinking she might have been able to, but Ellesandra's honor wouldn't allow it. She stepped forward, offering a hand to Star in case she wanted an embrace after that news, like previously.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked at Ellesandra with an expression that slowly, bit by painful bit, broke. Tears welled in her eyes. Pain built behind her eyes. Not only was there possibly some awful torture happening to her mother, but they were in the clutches of this dark monster. It was disheartening. Dispiriting. Star's resolve was strong enough to withstand, but...The truth still shook her to her core. Enough that she didn't want to waste time dealing with her emotions. Instead she shot up to her feet and began hastily towards the door. She was choking back sobs, but if Ellesandra wasn't going to stop her, she was going to charge out and make a ruckus until she secured a coach to take her to the next step in their journey.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did stop her. The thing about Ellesandra pushing down her emotions was, well, she pushed them down. She didn't let them overwhelm her, like Star was doing now. The pure exception to that being the other night in the Elven settlement. Star wouldn't be able to hike while feeling this much, right now. So when Star tried to move towards the door, Ellesandra caught her by the arm and stopped her. She gave a gentle tug towards herself, though she wouldn't force Star into a hug or embrace if Star didn't want it. The tug was to encourage Star to move towards her rather than the door, and if she did, Ellesandra would wrap both arms around her and squeeze tighter than she had any other time doing so. If not, she just held onto Star's arm, either way saying - "Star, rushing right now isn't the right move. Take a breath, process or repress whatever works for you, but if you rush out you're just going to get yourself into danger. You HAVE to take care of yourself so you are in a good state to help your mother WHEN we find her." Ellesandra emphasized when, not if.

  There was a contest of desires the moment Ellesandra pulled Star back. One side of her demanded she push Ellesandra away and storm out. That every second mattered, now. That with this knowledge, every second wasted was possibly the second that would make them arrive a second too late. Then, the fate of her mother would truly be on her shoulders in her mind. There wasn't a way this played out where she avoided feeling soul-crushing guilt if they didn't find Aurora alive. But the other side of her? The other side of her demanded she listen to Ellesandra. Demanded she accept the hug. Accept the closeness she craved with her companion. Ultimately...Star was, at her core, a woman of heart. A woman of companionship. Solidarity. She could not reject Ellesandra. So she threw her arms around them, desperate and needy as she sobbed and shook and clung to the knight. "S-She could be suffering!" she cried. "She could be being tortured! She needs me! I need to save herrrrrr!" she continued to cry out in long, heavy sobs. A broken sort of crying that wasn't too different from the night Ellesandra ran off to cry to themselves. The cries of pain that came from a wound that cut as deeply as wounds could cut.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra slid her hand up to rest in Star's hair, pulling her to lean into Ellesandra's shoulder. She simultaneously squeezed at her back, and let her hand just casually and lightly message into Star's scalp and hair. She turned her head away from Star, but tilted it so the side of her head rested against Star's own. "I know." She whispered, knowing she would have felt the exact same way if this had been Marigold. She HAD felt that way, when it was Marigold. "But trust me, Star. Rushing won't do you, or her, any good. You'll put yourself into danger and potentially make it worse. We will find her, okay? I promise you that." There was more that Ellesandra wanted to say, but she didn't entirely believe it. And she knew Star would be able to see through that. Things like it wouldn't be Star's fault if they hurt her, because Ellesandra would be a hypocrite with that. In a very similar situation, Ellesandra took all the blame - not the ones who had captured Marigold, but herself. Granted the situation wasn't exactly the same, but it was close enough that the parallel wasn't lost on her. Wordlessly, she'd walk them both backwards to one of the beds and pulled Star down on it with her so that Star didn't have to worry about standing, worry about collapsing into Ellesandra or anything. She could just lay and let herself get entirely wrapped up by the knight, big spoon like, and cry until she got it out of her system.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was malleable to Ellesandra's will. She allowed herself to be laid and spooned. The emotions she felt were overflowing, and the barrier between her and Ellesandra was almost non-existent in the moment. Their resonant auras shattered through any resistance, opening their hearts to one another in the moment. It allowed Ellesandra to feel the depths of Star's sorrows, the guilt she felt for letting her mother send her away, for not standing beside her mother even at the cost of her own life. The guilt that compounded with the knowledge that Aurora might be suffering. The blame focused inward, feeding the growing mound of sorrow that swelled in her chest. The parallels were certainly there to be drawn. But Star dealt with this in the direct opposite way to the knight. She let it all flow through her. She let herself experience all the hurt. And the unfortunate reality was that with Ellesandra spooning her, holding her close, they too were experiencing it. Not through their own heart, but the potent sorrows that so closely mirrored the knight's own were plain for their heart to reach out and understand, perhaps even inadvertently trigger their own mirrored sorrows. Whatever the case, Star would need...A while before she was okay again. She'd been doing a lot of crying lately, and the fatigue was sure to mount for it eventually.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expect to fully feel Star's emotions this time. Previously, she could see them, know they were there, feel that Star had them - but to actually feel them herself? It took everything in her not to just yank away from Star at that. She did twitch, the urge there, but she stopped herself from actually pulling away last second. Trepidation was there, but it was easily overpowered by the strength of Star's own emotions right now. The guilt, it was so familiar. As she felt it, it was hard to even separate it from her own guilt at how Marigold had just went and gave herself over, for Ellesandra. She let out a breath, as if punched in the gut, when those feelings began to overwhelm into her own. "Fuck." She breathed out, not even realizing it. She wanted to hold Star and help her through it, but she didn't know if she could. Star was just...FEELING all of this. And on top of that, unbeknownst to her, Star would be feeling how her own emotions were tugging at those same ones in Ellesandra. It felt like a void inside of Ellesandra, one that she avoided at all costs, was slowly leaking the pain and guilt from it. The mixture of shame in that guilt, feeling as if it had been her fault, and also that being reinforced by others in her life afterwards. The pain at losing someone Ellesandra had loved; it wasn't as overwhelming as Star's only because it was held back, repressed firmly, but the extreme feeling from Star broke into it some. Ellesandra gritted her teeth, trying to resist that urge to pull away entirely. She wasn't prepared to actually feel these emotions with Star. Her arms around her slackened a little, but she didn't pull away. Instead she took a deep breath and did everything she could to reinforce the emotional barrier between them. It was surely not even close to enough, but she attempted it. Additionally, she hardened herself to the emotions she was feeling as much as she could. If she could repress them just like she did with her own emotions, she would. It wouldn't stop her from feeling it right now, but she would push them down and instead use them to fuel an anger and hatred for Black Diamond, for doing this to Aurora and Star. Still, she felt herself curl up against Star and tears prick at her own eyes from the strength of them, teeth clenched and breathing deeply to resist pulling away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star turned in Ellesandra's hold at some point during this, pulling herself against the knight instead of being spooned by them. Their desire to hold Star was clear. As was their desire to help. Ellesandra would in turn feel the same, reciprocated. A desire to hold Ellesandra, to be close to them. A safety she felt in their arms. Happiness from their presence. Comfort. Worries that tied to thoughts of being overeager. Pleasant feelings that stemmed from their night on the rooftop. It was complicated and nuanced, crushed under the weight of wave after wave of guilt and powerful sorrows. But in the depths of all that sadness, there was that singular core of comfort. Star wanted to be near Ellesandra. It was a deep, strong need for the other woman. When Star had said they cared about Ellesandra, it was a sincere statement. The care and concern ran deep in Star. A sensation of anxiety associated with Ellesandra being away from her was closely nestled in a globe of fear that closely was bound to a sensation of loneliness. It was difficult to parse a lot of the emotion for someone like Ellesandra; the mystic connection was intuitive to some degree, but it was like learning to control a whole new appendage that was foreign and had no basis to relate to. The basics were easy enough to understand, but the more complex the emotions became, the more they began to tie in knots and become indecipherable. Her heart and Ellesandra's were open to one another; if there were any doubts Ellesandra held, conscious of unconscious, the connection rather forcibly contested them. No matter where Ellesandra might look, there were no ulterior motives to be found. The concern, the admiration, the comfort, the happiness, it was all genuine. A great desire to help Ellesandra lingered as well, but it was held back, with a bubble of frustration, under a greater notion of respect. Star's heart being bare allowed a great insight into just how pure the empath was at her core, and thusly how deep her pain ran from the belief that she had done wrong, that she had caused another harm, then amplified a thousand fold because it was her own mother. Outside of the connection, Star wailed and sobbed and shook as each pound of sorrow moved through her heart. Well and truly, ignorance had been bliss for her, and having to face the reality of what she believed was her own fault, was tearing her heart into bloody pieces of gore right before Ellesandra's eyes.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't focus on any of Star's emotions, as much as she could. She was focusing on just the feel of Star in her arms and how she felt sorry for Star. She was simultaneously sorry that she shared this information, but still affirmed in her belief it was the right thing to do in the long run. If Star found out later, and learned that Ellesandra had known the whole time but let Star 'slack off', per say, she wasn't about to deal with that level of anger from Star. She felt the obvious care, concern, admiration, but Ellesandra didn't let herself focus on it, think about it. In response to it though, Star might feel that Ellesandra felt...particularly protective of Star. A caring for her that came form a sense of similarity between Star and Marigold - though Star wouldn't necessarily know that exactly. A refusal to let the same thing happen to Star, and a firm belief that she would protect Star as best as she could. Additionally, there was attraction. Star was pretty, and Ellesandra had considered flirting with her. She would have, if Star were not a client and also someone who Ellesandra thought could handle a casual thing. This attraction wasn't nearly strong enough to overwhelm the obvious grief and guilt that was wracking Star though, and even as Star turned into her and held her in response, Ellesandra reached up to run her fingers through Star's hair and do what she could to comfort the empath. Ellesandra raised her head so that her chin was resting atop Star's and Star was pulled into her chest - as uncomfortable as that might be with her armor, it was still a closeness and something to hold onto. She'd wait out this feeling, just trying to silently be there for Star, and filter out as much of the pain she was getting from her as possible.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The honourable notion of it all resonated with Star. It was the right choice. It was better that she know. It was the immediately painful choice, but the one that resulted in the least pain overall. The honest path. It forced Star to face the things she was afraid to face. And it hurt. But it wouldn't kill her. It wouldn't beat her. Because each time there was a wave of pain, of sorrow, she gripped onto Ellesandra a little more tightly for a short while. Sure, it was just armor. But where the physical failed to convey how she needed them, their resonating auras made it clear as day. The desire to protect, and the desire to be protected, melded perfectly together in splendid harmony. Just as Ellesandra's attraction was met in turn with mutual attraction. Star had said plainly that she found Ellesandra pretty. It was more than just a passing comment of course, a hollow remark. It was genuine as could be, though there was far more to this emotion than just some surface level admiration that could not be accurately understood without dedicated focus. Nuance and subtlety permeated the emotions surrounding the more intimate parts of her heart, but it would be easy to see a pathway from the feelings of safety, security, admiration, and desire for closeness to blossom into something...More, even if it now was but a seed yet to breach its shell and sprout roots; little more than a flickering spark that needed to be fanned to ignite. Such emotion was present, though no single emotion could bear any focus for long even if Ellesandra did choose to do so. Regardless, it would be the better part of an hour before Star finally grew too tired to cry anymore, before the walls shakily began to restructure between them. Not effective walls, of course. But the minimal barrier that spoke of at least attempting to separate their hearts again. Still...Star was in no shape to face any challenges. She still needed comfort.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra didn't push Star to do anything while she recovered. Each wave was felt, and she just held Star, alternating to petting her head, rubbing at her back, squeezing at her, and just holding her lightly throughout the waves of pain and sobbing. Even as it stopped, as she began to recover from it and build barriers back up, Ellesandra held her. Just because she'd cried herself out right then didn't mean that she no longer needed that comfort - she knew that even without the emotional connection. Ellesandra had done her best not to pry into the feelings she'd felt from Star during their embrace, actively not thinking about them and focusing on other things to help keep her mind focused away from them, so all she'd really gotten was that the attraction was returned in a way that wasn't just 'oh look she's so pretty!' that some people felt. As Star did begin to calm more, the crying stopping and that wall fully built again - even if not as strong as normal - Ellesandra pulled away just enough so that she could look down into Star's face, and eyes if they were open. "How about we stay here and lay like this for a little longer, then you go shower again and see if you can restabilize yourself. I'll have breakfast out here afterwards, and then we can start on our way for the day, okay?" She paused, and then added. "Do you need to talk about anything?" Ellesandra was doing what she would need in this situation. She would need a plan. Sure, she'd just let herself feel all the pain and guilt. Now time to push it away, plan the logical path forward, and then start executing it. She didn't know if this would help Star at all, and knew Star preferred talking, which is why she added the last bit there too.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked back up at Ellesandra, wholly embraced by the comforts of their arms, gestures, and voice. She stared deeply into Ellesandra's eyes in this moment, as if seeking their soul through their gaze. A gaze that said, without saying a word, that there was...So, so much she needed to talk about. So much she needed to say to Ellesandra. But despite that, she gently shook her head. "I just need to be held by you a little longer. Just a little longer." After that time, the rest of Ellesandra's plan was free to take shape if the knight sought to take that path. It didn't really bring any comfort to Star to have such a plan of action, but the notion of moving forward towards her goal was something to focus on outside of the countless thoughts that remained unsaid.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did exactly that. The staring and soul gazing seemed...odd, and Ellesandra looked away, uncomfortable by the intensity of the stare. But she did hold Star, squeezing a little tighter and even going so far as to wrap her legs around Star's so that she could feel entirely enveloped and held, entirely protected. She'd pulled Star back into her as well, gaze moving back up to the room and silently just letting Star feel the comfort she needed. Her heart beat a little harder than it probably should be, a nervousness at this embrace since Ellesandra had not truly held someone like this in...years. She'd taken lovers, but the last time she'd held a lover like this had been Sophia, long before the incident had happened. She didn't let herself think about that often, but now she did let her mind stray, simply because it was something to focus on rather than the feel of Star in her arms.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star naturally morphed into the hold, shifting to be more flush against Ellesandra. The tangling of legs, the tenderness of the hold, the rising pulse...It certainly stirred something in Star. She was far too sad to go shifting into something amorous, but the way her sorrows opened up her vulnerability? It made it all the easier for Ellesandra's presence to affect her. She tucked her head under Ellesandra's chin where it felt natural to keep it and just basked in silent comfort. It was nice. The emotional walls steadily grew stronger, but for the time they remained broken open, Ellesandra would be able to feel the quiet harmony of their auras with one another. The feeling of this moment being...Right. Natural. For as different as the two were, there were aspects big and small where they completed each other. And in this moment, there wasn't anyone else in all the realms that could bring Star the comfort she needed in this very moment other than the woman who now held her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let Star settling into her relax her a little. Oh, she was still on guard - she didn't know if she'd ever able to let her guard down while touching Star. But still, it felt - right. A rightness she hadn't felt, ever. One of those moments where you just knew you were in the right spot, doing what you should be doing. Not necessarily that it was fated, but more than in the situation they were in, this was definitely the right thing to do. The closeness and how much she enjoyed just feeling Star against her, even if it had been from a situation in which Star had been distraught, scared Ellesandra a little. And once she realized that, there was a solid wave of guilt that slammed into her. Guilt at being able to move on, to enjoy the company of another like this in more than just a physical, pleasurable way. She'd never let herself feel a connection with someone since the incident, nothing more than a pleasurable lay that they were both okay with being just that. She almost pulled away from Star when she realized that, her body shifting as if about to, but then she remembered why Star was against her. This wasn't a post coital cuddle. This wasn't waking up in the morning after sleeping together, holding onto one another and enjoying the closeness of a partner. This was Ellesandra offering Star comfort while she ached and dealt with the guilt and sorrow of knowing her mother was alive, but being held captive by someone who obviously had no care for someone else's personal boundaries, based on what happened to Lissana. Was Star worried that the same thing might be, or have happened to her mother? She couldn't imagine that feeling. So instead of pulling away, like she instinctively wanted to do, she let her arms tighten in around Star again, adjusting her head so her chin pressed into the top of Star's own head reassuringly, and closed her eyes. She'd stay like this until Star moved away, or said something.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star couldn't know what made Ellesandra want to pull away, only that there was some apprehension. Some sort of fear. But that fear also was quashed. Choosing Star over these fears. It felt good. A calm happiness washed over her at that. It was a reassurance that she was important to Ellesandra. She didn't dig deeper than that. It was what she needed, though. As she had said to Ellesandra before, the connection between their hearts, the unwarded openness and vulnerability between them, even if it wasn't intentional, had allowed her to know deep in her heart, as surely as one can ever know something, that she mattered. That she wasn't alone. And that made this daunting task, this dangerous quest, feel more possible. It made Ellesandra's voice echo in her head. 'We will find her', it echoed. 'I promise you that'. And with that, Star drew in a deep breath, squeezed Ellesandra one more time, then leaned up and placed a soft kiss on their cheek before pulling away, rather immediately blushing for what she did...But still smiled. "...Thank you, Ellesandra. Thank you for staying with me." Did that mean in the moment? In general? Both? The sincere appreciation she wore suggested both.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star began to move, she looked down at her, only to rear her head back with wide eyes when Star kissed her cheek. There was obvious confusion in response to that action, and a nervousness that caused her stomach to churn. A few blinks were given at her, even as Star thanked her, and then her she looked at Star's burning cheeks. Okay, that was enough holding. The guilt came back again, the fear that she was letting Star in too much and being unfair to Marigold - even if Marigold was dead - hit Ellesandra even harder after the brief cheek kiss. She released Star from her embrace and rolled to the other side of the bed, moving to sit up and throw her legs over the edge of the bed, back to Star. "It was my fault you felt that way, since I shared the news with you against Sapphic's recommendation." She just couldn't have held it back - her honor wouldn't have let her, but especially not after what Star had said that morning. "Are you feeling up to moving about now?" A very obvious subject change, while Ellesandra tried to build her barriers fully back up. Damn auramancer and resonance and making her private emotions not private.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a small confusion upon seeing the guilt. Star couldn't quite pin down what the root of such an emotion would be, so she would be left just assuming she overstepped. Her own guilt rose at that, which at least gave a sobering wave to clear the blush from her cheeks. "I'm glad you did. It hurts to know but...I'm better for knowing. I can act more appropriately, instead of embracing ignorance. Instead of just relying on hope." Truly, despite the pain, the steady measure of Star's voice suggested she was in a better headspace. The red tearstains on her face and the slight hoarseness to her voice told the story of the pain necessary to reach this state, but she was better for it. "Being around you helps cement in my heart that...Even the most difficult truths need to be shared. Fear has held me back from that in the past but...No more." She gave a smile to her knightly companion. "I'm ready, now."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She was glad, really, that Star appreciated the truth. They'd get along, since Ellesandra wasn't one to hold back information she knew that was relevant just to spare Star's feelings. She did feel bad about how much pain Star was in right now, because surely even after all of that crying she still would have that sorrow and guilt. Standing after the confirmation - which was needlessly sappy, Ellesandra thought, though she was ignoring the compliment within - she moved to the door and was about to open it for them both but then stopped. She looked back at Star's face, and blinked a few times. "Oh, that's right. Did you want to freshen up while I got food for us? When travelling we'll need to use the food Lissana and Morrun gave us so it doesn't go bad right away, but while we're at the tavern might as well get our breakfast here."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile at the question and nodded. "I think I should, yes. A shower to make myself presentable and calm down sounds nice," she said, then set about moving to the shower. The trip down to place an order for breakfast would be as typical as every other time, save for one thing. There appeared to be someone watching Ellesandra. From one of the corners of the general room, one of the corners that Ellesandra and Star had seated themselves at previously to avoid wayward eyes, there was a cloaked figure whose scarlet eyes followed Ellesandra. The black cloak obscured some of their face, but there didn't appear to be any weapons brandished by the cloaked figure. Instead, there was a blank card in front of them, and they had a brush in one feminine hand, with a series of coloured inkwells off to the side. Their gaze wasn't malicious, but rather...Studious, as if committing all of Ellesandra's features to memory. To someone less paranoid, the gaze might be overlooked, but Ellesandra was almost certain to notice the fixed gaze while their typical swiveled vision scanned the room for threats. Was this figure a threat? One couldn't say either way at first glance.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded, and watched for Star to enter the bathroom before she'd turn to head downstairs. She was concerned about her companion, that was obvious, but there were also obvious reasons to be concerned. She also felt that guilt, one which was hard to acknowledge since acknowledging why she felt it acknowledged Marigold's death. She got the basic breakfast platter for them both, though also got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for Star since they figured she needed something extra this morning. And Star liked, juice, right? She didn't remember for certain, but she also thought she might have seen Star drinking some at Morrun's. Either way, just a little extra to make her feel better so she wouldn't dread the hike today. It was likely Star hadn't gotten much sleep, so Ellesandra was going to go easy on any pace and encourage Star to slow down if she tried otherwise. Her eyes did eventually turn as they were scanning the room and land on one particular cloaked figure. The scarlet eyes caught her attention, along with the black cloak. Her eyes narrowed - surely, this wasn't black diamond, no? Potentially one of his servants, perhaps? The obvious gaze at her, studious, made it so that Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable not addressing it. Best to address it without Star here, safe in their room instead. So while waiting for their breakfast, Ellesandra would walk over, stopping a respectable distance away from this cloaked figure. "Can I help you?" The question was polite, but the tone was forced - obviously assuming the worst about the person after their run ins with Black Diamond recently.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The figure looked at Ellesandra as they approached. They slowly drew back the hood of their cloak. Two furry ears poked up from atop their head of black hair. The woman wore a neutral expression. "My apologies," she began. "I was merely using your likeness as inspiration for my art," she continued, eyes drifting down to the blank card in front of her. The card was nearly twice as long as it was wide, what one would expect of fortune telling cards. As the woman pressed her sable-haired brush down to the card, its bristles dripping with a rainbow of inks mixed upon the hairs, the inks seemed to come to life upon the blank card. Colours spread across the canvas of the card, forming depths of hue and shading. A black border outlined the card, which featured Ellesandra's likeness. The card was split down the middle by a jagged golden line, with the left half depicting half of Ellesandra broken, beaten, bloody, and defeated. The other half depicted Ellesandra proud, pristine, heroic, and triumphant standing tall with her rapier firm in hand. The broken side had Ellesandra's armor cracked and splintered. The heroic side had it pristine and polished. The background behind Ellesandra on the broken side looked to be a dungeon of some sort, with wrought iron manacles attached to chains affixed to the stone wall behind them. The triumphant side depicted a background of a beautiful, flowery meadow. Across the bottom of the card, a tan ribbon bore the name of the card. However, the name changed depending on which side Ellesandra happened to be looking at. If they looked at the broken side, the card bore the name 'Defeat', and if their eyes fixed upon the triumphant side, the name of the card shifted to say, perhaps expectedly, 'Triumph'. The artistry bore impossible detail in it, capturing Ellesandra's likeness perfectly down to the individual strands of silvery hair. All of it formed itself through this woman's curious magic touch in less than a minute, where a master artist might take months to recreate such a thing of beauty. The furry-eared woman didn't seem to find anything strange about this, of course, as she turned the card around for Ellesandra to see, if they so wished to look upon it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned at the explanation, and the sight of the furry ears. That didn't seem like something that Black Diamond would have, but maybe Ellesandra had seriously misjudged them? No, this person might still a servant of Black Diamond, but just because she was wearing a black cloak and had red eyes didn't mean anything in specific. Her eyes moved to stare at the card as it was formed however, eyes widening as the art seemed to draw itself and definitely was a likeness of her. Her mouth opened, both impressed at how well the woman had just done that - it really did look like her - and bothered by the subject of the card itself. That struck a little too close for comfort, and Ellesandra was already dealing with Star being able to see into her emotions, as well as Black Diamond and apparently Sapphire knowing her past and thoughts. It put her even more on guard as her arms crossed, frowning down at the card, then back up to the woman. "And...do you typically use people's likeness without their permission?" She could compliment the card - that's what Star probably would do. But Ellesandra was wary, cautious, and didn't like being the subject of magic without her permission. If this card in any way was magically connected to her, that would not be ideal.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "People do not tend to notice me, if I am being honest. There was no offence meant, truly. But it is only upon certain people that I feel the spark of inspiration. It was important that this card be created." The woman spoke with a tone that implied she believed her words were fact. A certain...Knowing quality to them. "My name is Freya, by the way. You are welcome to keep this card in your possession. It will allow...Introspection. But I will take no offence if you prefer not to. I mean you no harm...But I also sense the wariness in you. An understandable disposition."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
People tended not to notice someone in a black cloak with red eyes? They weren't very observant then, were they? That type of garb combination tended to draw attention, in Ellesandra's experience. Her eyes turned down to the card again, not sure that she trusted it. It was obviously made with magic, but was it safer to take it herself, or let the woman take it with her? Either way was a risk, depending on how the woman's magic worked, and Ellesandra did not know anything about it. At least, if it was targeted at Ellesandra and she took it and it was some sort of trap, she knew she was relatively resistant to magic. With that consideration making the risk of this Freya taking it higher, she did reach and tentatively picked the card up. She raised it up to eye sight, tilting it to look at it for a moment, before nodding to Freya. "I will take it then, Freya." She could ask what exactly it was about herself that inspired Freya. She could also ask if it was typical for her to offer the card to people, or what introspection meant here, or how her magic worked. Ellesandra didn't, though. Instead, she continued watching the woman with a frown, only still here because she was still waiting for their food. "I will not have to deal with this card catching fire or something of the like during my travels, will I?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Freya gave a soft smile and shook her head. "Nothing of the sort, I assure you. Simply, the golden division in the middle of the card will shift left or right, revealing more of one side or the other, in balance with your own heart. For your eyes only. To all others, it will appear only as you saw it initially, until such time passes that it firmly cements on one half or the other." And as Ellesandra picked up the card and examined it while Freya spoke, what she said became reality. The card resonated with Ellesandra's heart, shifting one way or the other, though it could not go to either side fully just yet. Instead, a half inch or so to either extreme was its ending point. But what Ellesandra saw would depend on their own heart. Did they see themselves as a failure? A success? And to what degree? Would it shift all the way? Part of the way? It was still only Ellesandra's to see. "When the time comes, and the card has swayed fully to one side or the other, it will give an equally strong, yet differing boon to you. A magical strength, to be used only once. But only once your heart has become certain on which path you will walk."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When her eyes fell upon it with that explanation, holding it, she saw the shift. What was previously just the down the center, half and half of the card, suddenly the triumph side got smaller. It wasn't entirely gone, though it had shifted to where it only took up one quarter of the card's art space rather than the full half it had previously. The sign of the dungeon, the chains, made Ellesandra clench her jaw. She didn't quite know how she felt about this, but it made her uncomfortable. In reality, it scared her. It was like she told Star the other night - she didn't think she was anywhere close to being heroic. She had too much baggage weighing her down - chaining her down. The relation in the art and how she felt was bothersome. Seriously, first Star could see her emotions and now this damn card could see into her heart? It was almost as if the world was trying to force her to confront her past, when she very much did not want to. She lowered the card, planning to put it in her pack when she went back upstairs but for now slipping it into a pocket in her leggings. "A magical boon. That you give out for free. What are you getting from this? Will you be able to spy on us with this, get some sort of magic from me? Or perhaps your magical strength is strengthened by mine through daily contact?" Yes, Ellesandra wasn't exactly trusting - and this seemed like too good of a thing to just assume it was free.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "It is my duty. Seldom do I relinquish cards to others that have magic that can be used outside of the Spire, but when the calling of the card is to remain with the bearer of its inspiration, such is the result. I gain nothing for this. I will not observe you. In fact...It is the more likely result that you never see me again, unless it so happens that the Spire wills it. I do not blame you for your suspicions, of course. Those who tread a difficult path often greet fortune assuming it holds a dagger behind its back. I can tell you that no such ulterior motives exist in this gesture, but it makes little difference to me whether or not you believe me. Only that if you do walk away feeling that fortune has smiled upon you, I will be able to wear a smile. It would be nice, if I might be honest...To be able to finally make a positive difference in the life of another. But I shan't hold up your breakfast with a sob story."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Duty. That was the word that got her attention. She looked at the woman closer - obviously not a follower of Torm or anything of the like, but duty was still something that permeated many cultures and beliefs. Of course, there were some who believed in duty but still strayed from it, but somehow the woman just claiming it was her duty eased some suspicion. Oh, not all of the suspicion, but it eased the bit about whether or not Freya was getting anything from this. Sometimes you did things for duty not because you got something in return, but because it felt good to do what you were supposed to do. Ellesandra knew this well, and it was one of the main reasons she had signed herself up to Star without payment, knowing Star couldn't truly afford it. Who was she to look a gift horse in the mouth when she'd given a very similar gift to Star just recently? She still watched the woman curiously for a moment, but as she saw the waitress coming with her's and Star's plate, she would give Freya a nod. "Then I wish you a pleasant evening and that you have a smile on your face." She didn't actually consider this a positive experience - the card was too close to her truth and it wasn't encouraging. But, there was no need for Freya to know that, right? Unless Freya was someone who could tell when she was lying as well - admittedly, Ellesandra wasn't very good at it since she did it so rarely. She took the plates and balanced the two mugs in her hands, preparing to head back up to their room if Freya didn't say anything else or stop her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Freya had no reason to stop Ellesandra, though did look genuinely happy for the fleeting moments as Ellesandra walked away. Whatever the thoughts of the curious furry-eared woman were remained hers forevermore. She pulled the hood of her cloak back up, and resumed idly looking over the others who were sitting with a look of mild disinterest. When Ellesandra came back up, Star was sitting peacefully on the bed in quiet meditation, hair still damp from her shower. Ellesandra entering did break her from her meditation, however, and she greeted them with a smile, accepting her plate and juice when offered with a bit of a sweeter-than-usual smile. Star never let a thoughtful gesture go without its due appreciation. And so the usual balance of more veggies for Star and more meat for Ellesandra followed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet as the food was divvied up, but once she was sitting on the bed with the plate of food in her lap and eating, she did take a moment to pull out the card she had been given and toss it over next to Star. "Do you sense anything bad about this? A stranger gave it to me downstairs, it's magical and will apparently give me some sort of magical boon once one side or the other fully encompasses the card." She didn't need to explain that she didn't trust that way, most likely. She was interested in how it worked, even if she was wary of it, and she trusted Star plenty enough to look at it and tell her if the card was going to kill her or something. Or maybe not kill her, but if it had any less-than-good intentions within the magic. Like always, she said this between bites, eating otherwise like a very prim and proper lady would. Even while resting the plate on her legs, she was sitting up straight out of pure habit and could have easily been mistaken as a noble knight.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked and looked at the card when it was handed to her. She set her plate aside briefly and studied it. For a moment, she closed her eyes and her aura became visible. A swath of blue surrounded her, enveloping the card as well. She remained like this for some time before snapping out of her trance-like state with a jolt. Her brows knit together, then she looked at Ellesandra with some measure of uncertainty in her face. "Nothing bad, no. Just...Powerful. Very...Powerful. Entirely something that is up to the wielder of it, but it feels as though it won't respond to me. Like it will only respond to, well...You," she said, tilting her head. "Who was this stranger you met?" she asked as she held the card back out to Ellesandra. "This card it...The power inside it is...frighteningly strong. And locked behind a magical lock so potent that my magic would be but a whittled twig scratching against a castle wall made of adamantine. Whatever this magical boon is...I can be certain only that it will be yours to control, and that whoever gave this to you wasn't just...Some stranger."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra continued eating, silently watching Star as she began to examine the card. There was a concern that it would somehow trigger something and hurt Star, so Ellesandra was mindful to keep an eye on her and the card while she was examining it. When Star began explaining how powerful it was, Ellesandra took a deep breath and shook her head. "Someone named Freya, and she mentioned something about a Spire. I've not heard of her or anything like a Spire before, but I must be honest with you Star. Between you reading my emotions, Black Diamond being an overall ass, Sapphire joining Black Diamond in invading my dreams, and now this Freya person making a card with my likeness that is..." She paused, motioning to the card as if it was explanation itself. "I'm a little tired of supposedly extremely powerful beings invading on this journey. Deities and powerful beings can go fuck right off." All they wanted to do was find Star's mother, and rescue her from Black Diamond. Why was that so complicated? She speared a piece of sausage with her fork a little harder than was really necessary, wincing at the sound it made upon hitting the plate below it. "Sorry." She added, knowing that she'd included Star into that and not wanting to make her feel bad for a gift she couldn't control.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was pensive as Ellesandra responded. She ate quietly for a few moments, considering all that had happened. The stakes really hadn't seemed to be all that high on the grand scheme before. Nobody had really cared either way what she did. And now, suddenly that it seemed a plan was coming together, a path forward was being carved, it seemed everyone had something to say about it, and had to meddle in things. The annoyance sent her way certainly had its effect. Star always wore her emotions on her sleeve, and so the notion that she contributed to Ellesandra's emotional turmoil had her expression saddening rather pointedly. The apology eased it slightly, but the guilt was still crushing on her shoulders. She didn't say anything about it, her way of hopefully communicating that she didn't blame Ellesandra for their feelings. But the shame that something she couldn't control was negatively affecting Ellesandra was clear. Enough that she didn't have a verbal response to it, and she pointedly looked at her food rather than at her companion.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt guilt at how Star just didn't respond to her. It didn't take an emotional savant like Star to realize it was because she'd, in her mini rant, had commented about how much she disliked Star's ability to just read her. It was entirely true, but Star already knew that and it wasn't something she could just turn off, so pointing it out and making passive comments like she just did wasn't beneficial. She finished her own food in silence, sipping on her water, and as she finished she collected the mugs from last night and piled them all onto her plate with the water she'd been drinking that morning. As she passed back by Star, her hand came out and lightly brushed Star's shoulder. Not enough touch to really give the emotional connection time to do anything, but enough that Star would hopefully get the message of Ellesandra being sorry for the statement. She wasn't upset at Star herself, more just her power and the situation. It hadn't been a good idea to vent to a client anyways, though. A client shouldn't ever feel as if they were a burden to Ellesandra, and she had forgotten that for a moment. She'd prep things to get ready for their travel, letting the silence continue unless Star said anything else.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's hand rose up to hold Ellesandra's when it landed on her shoulder. She held it and gently squeezed, looking up at the other woman from her seat. She donned a small smile. Not enough to say everything was sunshine and rainbows, but just enough to say that they were okay. Star wasn't in distress or hurt, so the emotional barrier was stable and kept their hearts separated. "...I can handle the truth. And I'm glad you can say it. So...Even if it isn't nice to hear, I wanna hear it." Trying to be courageous in the face of painful words, it seemed. She didn't hold Ellesandra's hand long, just enough for her to speak her mind before releasing it again. She would still feel a bit bad, but that was okay to her. It was okay to feel bad. This too would pass.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It may be okay to feel bad, but that being layered on top of what had happened that morning with news from her mother too, Ellesandra just felt bad for piling it on. It didn't matter though - either way, they were going to be heading out. She collected her bag and put it back on her back, having been moved away sometime throughout the comforting earlier. The card was placed in it, careful not to bend or fold or damage it at all - the last thing she needed to do was accidentally offend another powerful magical being. She double checked, again, that they weren't missing anything, and then after Star was finished with her food would stack all of the plates and such so that she could carry it downstairs for the staff to clean without it being potentially forgotten up here for a while. She wouldn't rush Star, but after completing what she needed to prep the room for their departure, Ellesandra waited by the door patiently. She made sure not to look in Star's direction so that Star wouldn't feel rushed if she wasn't ready, simply standing and waiting like a practiced guard would.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was as eager if not more so than Ellesandra to head out, and she had been ready for a while. She still did not have a pack. Yet still was able to produce whatever she needed at will. Something that hadn't really been explained, yet remained true. Just little flickers of magic any time she needed to stow or withdraw something from...Wherever it was stored. She joined Ellesandra with a brief smile to them. "Northeast past the elven settlement, looking for some ruins I believe. Morrun marked my map with the approximate location, and it looks to be about a day's travel if we can secure a coach. By foot, probably about two, maybe three days."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded. "Best to get a coach if we have the funds for it. Not sure if we will be able to take it with us to Myst, but I'm sure you'll be happy to shave off as much time as possible - and with you not sleeping well last night a coach would be useful to keep us moving today." She wouldn't say it, but she had concerns about Star travelling hard and pushing herself too hard, considering her sudden rush to get there. The rush was understandable, but it was important she didn't wear herself out and make herself susceptible to danger on the travel. She opened the door holding their dishes and held the door open for Star to head out, then would begin following behind with the dishes. An immediate glance was given around when she got back down to the main room, both looking to see if Freya was still there, as well as to check for any other potential threats that had come in sense.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"After the five hundred Morrun paid us, we could coach halfway across the country and have a month's room and board left over at the finest inn," said Star with a giggle. "Coaches only run one copper per mile usually. We'd be silly to let money be what limits us on this," she said as they moved downstairs. No other threats had wandered into the inn, though Freya was still in the same place she was before, still cloaked and still idly looking at others in the area with disinterest. Eyes did flick to Ellesandra and a small smile met her lips, but her eyes no longer lingered. Her business with them was done, as far as she was concerned. Star's eyes, meanwhile, did naturally draw to Freya, and her gaze lingered on them for a short while. A look of sorrow overtook Star's face while she did so...Though she wouldn't let it hold her up. If Ellesandra was moving to exit, Star was right behind them to secure a coach, though she wouldn't hurry them along if they wanted to talk to Freya again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	That was true. She hadn't travelled with a coach as a customer in...had she ever? She'd assumed it was more expensive, but usually she was hired as a guard or something, never using them herself since she was comfortable walking and had never been in a rush. Now, though, they could definitely get a coach. Ellesandra walked up to the bar to return their plates and their key and making a quick inquiry as to where they could hire a coach. Best to get the directions from someone local, rather than trying to just roam the entire city looking. With directions, she turned and would give Freya a simple nod while heading out of the inn. She didn't notice the look of sorrow from Star, not being as in tune with recognizing emotion changes and not having been paying special attention to Star, versus their surroundings. Despite the reassurance from Star that the pirates were being controlled and they weren't really seeing pirates around town right now, Ellesandra was still on guard, eyes turning this way and that as they exited the Inn, and began making their way to the coach. "A coach is especially good because you may be able to get some sleep on it, as long as you don't get motion sickness. If you think you can relax enough to do so, that is. I can help take shifts with the driver if he needs a break as well."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The nod was met with another small smile. Fate would decide if this would be the last time the two would meet, but for now they parted amicably. The innkeeper was happy to direct Ellesandra to the trade center of the city which was in the northeast section of the pier. Coaches as well as sea-based trade services were available there at a typical rate, as one might expect of a moderately sized settlement as Cloverport. Star spoke up as they began on their way: "I can imagine you feel more at home on the back of a horse than in a seat behind them, but also I think it's fine to just let the driver set the pace. The horses will need time to drink and rest all the same, so as much as I know it goes against your base instincts, maybe try and relax a little? Not that I really have much place to talk on that front, I suppose.."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded. "Yes, I'm comfortable on a horses back, but I wouldn't be riding them if controlling the coach anyways." What she WOULD be is outside of the coach to keep a better eye out. The problem with being inside of the coach was her ability to keep an eye out for danger was severely limited. Despite Star encouraging her to just take some time to try and relax, all that was going on with these gems - which she was including Sapphire as one because her damn name was a gem too - made her untrusting of being able to let her guard down. There had been a note that while in Myst, they'd be safer from the gems, but until they got to Myst? Still in danger, and Myst surely had it's own dangers in and of itself. "I'll relax some, but I may take some time to keep pace outside of the carriage to keep an eye out too." It would be good exercise, anyways. Most coaches tended to go at a fast walk pace, or slightly slower, so it would be a decent way to stretch her legs and ensure that she didn't get too stiff while sitting in the coach. Another way to stretch her still slightly sore muscles after the haste spell the other day.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled. "Well, leave it to you to find any excuse to work yourself harder," she said with playful chiding in her tone. "But let it not ever be said you aren't diligent," she followed up, sincere as could be. She never needed a reason to try and uplift Ellesandra, it seemed. The trip over to secure a coach would be without incident; no pirates to be seen, people getting back to their lives, the elves having long since departed, and it was almost as if nothing had ever happened. Certainly, some things were in the works at the upper levels. Perhaps the local lord might have some reaction to the series of events, but overall, things seemed more peaceful for their intervention now. People seemed happier. Less on edge. Though nobody recognized Star or Ellesandra or their part in all of this, the effects were clear. A good deed had been done. Lives were made better. Life could go on without fear for the immediate future, and the woes became all the more mundane. The coach service had idle drivers to spare, and a standard agreement was easy to achieve. The destination on the map did confirm it would take about a day to reach the nearest point on the main road that was near the site of interest. They would arrive, all things going well, a few hours after dusk to be dropped off.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She wasn't finding an excuse to work herself harder. She was doing her job. Typical work, not working herself harder. At least, that's how she saw it. She let Star lead the discussion in getting the coach, more standing by and looking around at the area as they discussed business. It was great to see the town starting to get back onto it's feet, even if she was a little wary of everything still. It felt like the result was too good, and Ellesandra was waiting for the shoe to drop. Then again, ever since meeting Star, her life had been turned upside down so that was a reasonable expectation. Still, nothing seemed to happen. On the ride, Ellesandra alternated between walking alongside the carriage, especially at first when they were closer to town, and riding in the carriage. The ride was nice, to give herself a break, but even while riding her eyes were mostly glued to the window, using the little bit of view of the road outside she had to keep watch that way. She had been used to walking alongside one, or riding a horse alongside, the entire way, but she wanted to ensure she too was entirely up to a fight if one needed to be had. She'd mostly recovered from the haste spell, but a long day hiking on foot at a coach's pace, while possible, would strain her endurance more than it should have. A bleak reminder that she'd not kept up with the diligent training she should have, in the past few years. Still, during the travel she was mostly silent, though not against talking if Star spoke, Ellesandra didn't offer anything up herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star would make small talk along the way. Little bits, pointing out some pretty wildlife she spied, talking about how it was fortunate the storm that looked to be approaching Cloverport had diverted and missed them...Nothing of consequence, and nothing overbearing. Silence was allowed to be maintained, and Star took some time to meditate as best she could. Some bumps in the road did make it troublesome, but she did manage a little time. She also napped for about an hour and a half along the way during one of the stretches. As uneventful as trips went, truly. But there was plenty of excitement surely to come. Their destination reached, two silver parted from their inventory, and the coach was off to make some headway back to the city before making a camp for the night. Amicably parted, business concluded, the two now had to decide if they would make camp in the wild or push on through the night. The map marker showed their destination was vaguely an hour or so through some wooded areas to reach the ruins in question; there were some lightly traveled forest paths among the trees, but a paranoid adventurer may choose instead to walk paths not traveled, with some loss of time for trudging through more untamed wilderness.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Small talk was somehow worse for Ellesandra. To her, it was pointless conversation, whereas other topics with a purpose or meaning she could get behind. Still, she never shut Star down when she was talking, at the very least giving a listening ear if not being super responsive. As they made it to their destination and got off, she was thankful they'd gone for the coach. Not only did it mean it had been progress while still resting, but it also meant they got there in just one day versus if they had walked and taken multiple nights to do so. She looked around and motioned into the woods, keeping an eye out for sign of wildlife or beasts or anyone who might be nearby. "Why don't we get a bit inside, away from the road so we won't be a target, and set up camp there? Might be able to find a river or something to camp nearby with the remaining light we have now." She wouldn't recommend going to the ruins tonight, if only because the trip would be hazardous and they didn't know what to expect, but she also would follow Star's lead. It wasn't too risky, to the point that Ellesandra would stop Star, she'd just recommend otherwise.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could catch onto Ellesandra's annoyance at the small talk. It certainly diminished the amount she was going to engage in, and would affect how much she would going forward. It didn't bother her. She could adapt. When they did arrive, she deferred to Ellesandra's advisory. "Sounds like a plan to me," she said simply while doing an idle stretch, then prepared to move with Ellesandra. There wouldn't be any fresh water sources along the way unfortunately, but there were some places that served as securable places to rest with natural overhangs to huddle up against, and dry foliage to burn that wouldn't smoke for a campfire. Star would prove to have plenty of water if Ellesandra ran out, pulling it out of, once more, seemingly nowhere. That Star was an arcane adept made clear she certainly had plenty of talents Ellesandra did not yet know about, and while she wasn't out to bore Ellesandra with all of her capabilities, she also certainly would be resistant to explaining if asked.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had only consult Star's map for a moment to confirm there weren't any water sources nearby. Rather than trying to find one then, she did lead them through to find a nice, defensible and out of the way place to set up camp. Ellesandra made no complaint about doing most or all of the work to get the camp setup. She wouldn't stop Star from doing anything, but she also didn't expect it of her. She'd pull her pack off and then look over to Star, since this was the first time they'd be camping on the road together since meeting. "Do you have a tent or a bedroll in that magical bag of yours?" She'd ascertained the bag was magical, though of what means Ellesandra had no idea. Was Star simply storing a lot in a small space, or was she creating things as she pulled stuff out? Ellesandra had no idea, but she also didn't ask. There was curiosity there, but unless it was information that would be pertinent to their travels, like if Star had camping supplies, she wouldn't. It had become the norm to let her client do as they will and just support or provide as needed, even if she'd already gotten closer to Star than any client recently. "I've got a tent that would fit both of us, but I'm afraid I don't have an extra bedroll. And it may be beneficial for two tents if you have one, for your meditation."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I have my own tent and bedroll, but, erm, I don't know how to say this in a way that doesn't sound a little peculiar, but if it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to share a tent, if there's space for both of us. You see, erm...When we're in a settlement it's less a concern, which is why I hadn't really said anything, but out in the wilderness it's more pertinent." A bit of rambling, but she did seem to be circling the point, whatever it was. "I'm able to...Feel your presence in my sleep if I'm close. It helps me relax, as I'd be able to feel distress if something happened in the night. It's not the same as emotional transference that happens while I'm conscious of course, just...Think of it like an alarm, I suppose. If you find the notion uncomfortable, I won't press the matter! I just, well..." She blushed a little, here, looking away from Ellesandra as one foot bashfully twisted in place back and forth while hands folded behind her. "It would help me feel more at ease. N-No pressure, again. I promise."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra came up short at this request. She turned to look at Star, a curious and also conflicted expression on her face. On the one hand, Star was proposing it for an entirely logical reason. If Ellesandra being alerted nearby in the tent would alert Star too, that was beneficial. On the other hand, was that really so limited as to not work if they were in two different tents next to one another instead of in the same tent? Being in the same tent would run the risk of Star cuddling up close, which Ellesandra wasn't sure she was comfortable with while sleeping or not initiating it herself. It also ran the risk of Ellesandra having a nightmare, and Star being worried about her in regards to it. For something to do here and there until they got a second tent was one thing; as something to do every night on the road made Ellesandra a little concerned. "You aren't able to feel my presence if I'm keeping watch while at the fire, or in my own tent?" Was it a line of sight thing? That actually seemed like the most likely thing. "I -" There was a spike of embarrassment. A guardedness of...not wanting Star to see her when she had a nightmare. Not wanting to have to explain most of all, but also just the vulnerability of that. Still, Star wouldn't just accept a no, either. "I also have nightmares, sometimes. I'm a little afraid I might hurt you in my sleep during them. That, or ruin both of our nights of sleep with it." Neither of those comments and questions were a no, though. She was stating issues, concerns with the idea, but she hadn't refused Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Remember the vision I showed you? The memory of my childhood? My mom was talking about my aura sense, then. That time it was to detect a most dapper and honourable squirrel of course, but...When I'm conscious, I have a passive sense for auras around me, a sense that I can amplify if I focus on it. How far I can spread that sense varies, thin objects like a tent don't affect it much, thick walls impede it a little more but...It's mostly a matter of proximity. Unless you can think of a way to mush our tents up right next to each other so there's only a few feet between us, it wouldn't really have the desired effect." The implication being that if they DID know some way to fuss that, there'd be no issue. Properly securing the pitons for the tent did usually require a bit of berth around them, however, which made such a thing difficult to imagine. She of course noticed the spike in embarrassment and guardedness, however, so she rose her hands in a defensive posture. "O-Of course, I really do mean it that there's no pressure. I...Uhm. I could also..." She paused to consider what she was about to say, then shook her head. "N-Never mind. Just. Know that if you did have a nightmare, I would wake before you started hurting me, and could wake you in turn, if that...Helps, at all." She was tip-toeing around this issue, that much was obvious. She did desire it, but she knew this was pushing Ellesandra's boundaries, and she seemed very nervous to do so.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The words 'a most dapper and honorable squirrel' caused Ellesandra's mouth to twitch a bit. She almost smiled, though held it back - even if Star could see the obvious amusement in her emotions creep up a little. There was still caution, concern about doing this, but there was also...acceptance. No, Ellesandra wasn't aware of a way they could safely mush their tents up next to eachother, and really if she thought about it, Star would probably be hearing her on the nights she had a nightmare anyways. Maybe it would be better if it was a situation where Star could wake her up before it got too deep? Especially if either of the gems decided to partake in said nightmare, not that they seemed inclined to do so right now. There were a few moments of silence where Ellesandra just watched Star, indecision on her face, but then she turned and began setting up her tent. She didn't speak until it was out of her bag, set up, and she'd thrown her own bedroll inside near the entrance to the tent. It was a two person tent, so spacious enough for them to both lay down with a little bit of wiggle room, but it certainly wasn't spacious. After throwing her bedroll in, she motioned to the tent with her head. "Go ahead and set yourself up in there." An admission, to let this happen. There was already an inkling of regret, mostly fueled by anxiety at the situation and what she might dream of. But Star had a good point, and her safety was the priority.

  	Star saw the amusement, because of course she did. And that amusement begot some amusement in Star, evoking a little grin that silently said 'I saw that'. Amusement turned to curiosity and uncertainty as Ellesandra just...Set about setting up their tent without saying anything. Was that a good sign? A bad sign? Star almost spoke up to ask, but thought better of it, and elected to just stew in her own uncertainty and stand around uselessly for it. Setting up a tent did take a short while, so Star had plenty of time to be a bundle of anxiety until Ellesandra gave her the invitation in. She blinked. "Wh...Really?" A question and look of surprise that said she genuinely did not expect her request to be granted. With a smile and nod however, she moved over to the tent. A shimmer of white light flowed from either of her palms, forming into a vague cylinder between them. And from nothing, her bedroll came to exist. A bedroll made of sturdy material on the bottom, with plush silk inner lining on what was an enchanted outer layer of cloth to drape over herself, complete with a down pillow. Combined with the dress Star wore that never seemed to be able to stay dirty, and that Star had always carried a breezy, floral scent never once tinted with unpleasant odors, magic was the only answer to the question of how this woman maintained all of these things. Most bedrolls were obviously made for one, but this one seemed more spacious. Enough that it ensured their two bedrolls would be pressed together in the less spacious tent. Hers wasn't big enough for two people to fit with room to sprawl, but just eyeballing the size, one could see room for two if they snuggled close. Star obviously wasn't drawing attention to this fact as she laid the bedroll out, as she...Attempted to keep some distance between their two bedrolls. A little mushing of hers against the edge of the tent afforded about an inch of space between the two bedrolls, which she seemed satisfied with as she turned back to smiled at Ellesandra. A thankful smile, certainly.
