Through Ellesandra's travels they had doubtlessly encountered many faces good and bad; for them to hear the commotion of banditry in progress might be as familiar as the pleasant birdsong of a morning in these forested lands. "Oi! Get back here, girly! We ain't done wit'cha yet!" came the gruff voice of one man, dulled through the trees. Another voice cackled alongside the first. "Kekekeh, what'ssamatter? We ain't gonna hurt'cha, s'long as ya giz all your coin!" Then, a third voice. A womanly yelp. It was close by, but difficult to see through the tree-line. The main road did not have a clear path, so dashing through the underbrush was the most direct route. No other people could be seen along the road as it stretched north-south; the yelp of a woman in peril came from the east. Another voice then echoed. Male, like the other gruff ones: "A-ta-ta-ta, easy, girlie, ain't getting away that easy! We got'cha now, so why dun'ya give up nice and easy. We'll also be takin' that pretty silk dress o' yours, o'course.."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra was aimless. She was wandering, following road to town then another road to another town. Usually she picked up a job on the way, but no one in particular was travelling this way so this time, she was alone. Armor plated feet made that particular metallic noise upon each step down the dirt path, her eyes ahead and taking in the sights of the roads. Might as well enjoy the environment on her trip, right? That was, until she heard voices off in the distance, in the trees to the side of the road. Ellesandra came up to a stop, head tilting and listening. The voice of a few men, seeming to be trying to encourage someone to give them coin filtered through the trees. Despite this, Ellesandra didn't start moving, not into the sound of a womanly yelp came out. Ellesandra's left hand moved to rest on the rapier hilt on her right hip, taking a few steps forwards towards the trees and the underbrush. A glance was given down both directions of the road, and the other side of the road behind her; a cursory scan to ensure that this wasn't some ploy to trap her or get her surrounded or distracted. Not that anyone had reason to target her, but it wasn't unheard of for bandits to use the idea of a damsel in distress to trap someone else, too. Confirming that there was no immediate danger behind her, she eyed the right places to step and quickly moved through the underbrush, taking long strides that skipped as much ground as possible with intentionally placed steps to ensure that she didn't step on any traps that may have been left and hidden within the obscured brush. She ignored the pricks of foliage that brushed against her, stepping through into the small clearing that the bandits, and the woman, was. At least three men, and then the apparent damsel. Ellesandra didn't look particularly imposing, height wise. She was short at 5'1, though wearing an ornate looking white breastplate with carvings and designs on it, abnormal for someone to wear if they ever expected to get hit in it. A plate skirt, matched this, going down to mid thigh where it met long, gauntleted boots to protect the remainder of her legs. Black tights were worn beneath, both to cover the skin open to the air and prevent the metal from resting against it directly. Long, white hair was currently hanging down to her mid back, natural waves and curls in it. Typically if she were expecting a fight it would be worn up in a ponytail, though she hadn't been about to stop to put it up before stepping in. Blue eyes stood out from a pale skinned face, quickly taking in the situation. She did not immediately draw her blade, but would take a few steps to circle the situation, steps that would take her closer to the woman, but not quite in-between them yet. "Gentlemen, any chance I can persuade you to depart with your lives?" Words were spoken coldly, and straight to the point, with a stoic face that took years of practice to master. She looked almost bored, as if she didn't truly care about the outcome of this encounter. Her eyes reflected the dead feelings inside of her, but there were so many feelings that weren't being shown. Guilt was overwhelming, one that almost encompassed the rest of them and made them hard to feel. The guilt alone was pressing down the sadness, grief, depression. The only feeling that competed with the guilt was anger, though this was partially directed at herself so the anger and guilt blended together in many aspects. Rising up to the surface, the caution and suspicion at her current predicament, paranoia that this was a trap, and also irritation at these bandits for even making this an issue if it were a real situation. Preying on a lone traveler was weak and cowardly, and the irritation was making itself known.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Checking their surroundings, Ellesandra found nothing but empty road and a midday horizon greeting them in both directions. Unless the stray squirrel they spied on the tree behind them was secretly an evil-doer posing as a woodland critter, there was no trap to be found. Indeed, as they stepped through the underbrush, they came to find the situation exactly as it would be expected as they stepped into a clearing amidst the trees that sported trodden earth and patchy grass. Three bandits, each sporting red bandanas, scruffy beards, and less-than-pristine scimitars that had bitten the wood of ship decks as much as they had their pray. Pirates, it seemed, standing at various heights hovering around six feet, and all looking decently conditioned by their pirate lifestyle. Striped white and red sea-fairing shirts with suspender-bearing pants that were tattered and torn from the life at sea. A nearby port town to the north-east explained their presence here, though that remained a town yet to be visited by the knight. The three of them turned to look at the knightly woman when they arrived. They stood in a triangular formation, surrounding another woman. This woman looked entirely out of place among these ruffians, which was likely what led to this situation in the first place. A bit taller than Ellesandra at five-five. Long, flowing white hair pure as an untrodden snowfall. Bright, vibrant blue eyes that were as if the sky and the sea brought to bear their vastness to express the gentle soul of the woman they belonged to. Almost mesmerizing in their striking beauty, or they might be if not for the distracting red wound on the woman's cheek. A gash, likely from one of the pirate blades. It looks to have clotted, but the red streaks down her cheek were fresh and slowly drying. Further evidence of this wound could be seen on Star's dress. A bright, beautiful white and light-blue garment with exuberant frills and feathery adornments along the rim of its brassiere, with sheer fabric visible below the flowy skirt. A dress fit for a princess, even if Star was anything but. Star, despite being surrounded by these evil-doers, did not look exceptionally fearful. Adrenaline was clearly working through her. But it was not the face of an entirely helpless damsel. Just a woman who, even if they did know how to fight, was still very much in danger. The three pirates turned to the knight, the two that were facing Star turned their backs to her to face Ellesandra. The other was already facing them. "Ey? What's this, little lady? C'mon, now, no need for you t' get mixed up in all 'is, then, is there? Move along, we's just seeing to escortin' this 'ere lass to our, ah, protective custody, yeah?" said the first pirate, wearing a grin that showcased some dreadfully rotten and cavitated teeth. "Yeah," chimed in the second. "We'd uh, 'ate to have ta', you know...Get'cha all mixed up in this 'ere...Perfectly legal and legitimate transaction, eh?" he said, wearing a shit-eating grin for his attempt at deception. Star met eyes with Ellesandra when they observed her; she could see the crushing, overwhelming guilt upon them, as well as the anger boiling just under their calm exterior. Star dare not escalate the situation by striking, but...There was a calm readiness in her eyes. A silent signal that she would follow their lead. Star very obviously also did not have a weapon, so one might wonder just what she might have up her sleeve. If she had sleeves, at least. She did not.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra eyed the men who seemed to have ignored that she was well armored and dressed. She carried herself with a practiced, cautious ease. If these men were smart, they would have recognized that she was no mere traveler who just happened to be armed. She'd seen combat; plenty of it. When Ellesandra's eyes met that of the woman, and saw the blood there and along a gown, the irritation turned quickly into anger. It was too similar, seeing this woman on her knees, injured and surrounded by enemies. Her eyes had widened slightly when she looked at the woman, and saw her previous charge, instead. Not literally, of course, but the similarities were enough that her guilt ridden mind easily made a connection, and it took a moment of blinking her image away to reinstate the reality of their current situation. This woman wasn't her Princess, but it did not matter. She had been injured, and Ellesandra was not going to listen to these men's flimsy explanations. With a glance back at the nearest man, her left hand drew her rapier quickly. Her right raised and a light yellow light poured out of it, quickly covering her own body in an enchantment. There were no words spoken for the magic, though it became obvious why she didn't utilize a shield or anything with her rapier, as her right hand had drawn an invisible sigil in the air as the spell took form. Haste, a low powered one currently as these pirates didn't seem like they needed the full extent of the spell and the stronger it was, the bigger the toll it would take on Ellesandra's body. Just enough of a boost to ensure that as she struck, the pirates wouldn't be able to get to their captive. The captive woman looked plenty ready to fight back herself, but Ellesandra wasn't going to risk her own attack causing them to decide to kill the woman instead. With the speed that seemed supernatural to any normal warrior or bandit, her rapier shot out straight for the first man's throat. Ellesandra didn't hold back the killing blow, but whether or not it struck home the rest of her body was moving - grabbing his shirt and hauling him to the side as she stepped in to stand closer to the woman. Close enough that she could defend her if any of the men decided to step in towards her, but wanting to give her enough space to do whatever she had in mind; Ellesandra knew better than to step in between someone about to cast magic or make their own attack and accidentally ruin it or cause them to injure themselves.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The pirates shifted their stances when the other's weapon was drawn. A fight was inevitable, it seemed. And it was the arrogance of the outlaws that made them all too ill-prepared for what, or rather who, was about to strike them. The magic gave them pause, striking a mild fear into them. But one pirate saw fit to close the distance to try and stop the spell before Ellesandra could weave it. His reaction too slow, the distance too great, and his lifetime of fighting other unskilled pirates did not prepare him for the lethal precision Ellesandra employed. His sword was high, neck exposed as he charged with a battlecry at the knight. His life ended nigh instantly as Ellesandra's rapier pierced his neck, bulging his eyes as his hands grasped with futility at the wound and choked gurgles served as his final words before his lifeless body was discarded, leaving Ellesandra's rapier dripping with his crimson essence. The other two pirates remained too slow to react as Ellesandra took position near Star. Star, then, took the initiative to secure this fight for her knightly protector; she had been swelling magic within her chest while the conversation went on. Time enough for her to be ready upon a hair trigger to do what she planned. Her plan? She shot up to her feet beside Ellesandra, arms thrusting out to either side. A bright blue aura enveloped her as, in that split second of her shooting up, mana exploded outwards from her in the form of a blinding, brilliant light. As bright as the sun, yet Ellesandra would not find the light painful to their eyes. Instead, it was soft. Soothing. A residual white mist lingered around Star and spread out a handful of meters from her to make a swiftly dissipating fog in the aftermath of the spell; breathing deep within this mist would bring with it an emboldening, restorative sensation within Ellesandra, firmly suggesting Star to be the sort of magic user that focused on support and healing as the empowering mist filled Ellesandra's lungs. And, of course, while it empowered Ellesandra? The two remaining pirates were sent reeling back, free hands clutching palms over their eyes as they screamed in agony and blood poured out between their fingers over their eyes. Further evidence that the effect of the blinding flash was selective, given that to the knight it was little more strenuous than walking out into a sunny afternoon field. Wild, aimless swings of their scimitars found nothing as they tried to fight off the knight they knew was...Somewhere near them, ready to end them. Their blindness might be temporary, but given it was on the order of days it truly seemed Ellesandra would hardly have needed to use any magic at all to fell these fools. Doubly so with an ally like Star, though it stood to reason that it was only thanks to Ellesandra's distraction that Star could produce such magic, else she likely would not have ended up trapped in the first place.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had guessed the woman would be using magic of some kind, but she had not expected a brilliant light to appear out of nowhere. Our of instinct, Ellesandra turned her head away from the light and readjusted her position so that she was partially facing the woman, unsure if the woman was fully on her side or not. Still, the light wasn't actually painful to her eyes - something she didn't realize until a moment later - and instead it seemed...soothing. Energizing, really. Yet when she looked up to the pirates, it had obviously hit them differently, unpleasantly based on them seeming to be blinded. The caution and surprise almost filled her emotions, until it was roughly pushed down. Ellesandra could take time later to process what just happened and ask the woman about it. Right now, she was going to take advantage of the situation given. With the two men blinded and swinging their scimitars wildly, it was easy for Ellesandra to step up into range of them and avoid their aimless swings, her still enhanced speed being used to provide them both with a quick end. She could have kept them alive, but the risk of them doing something like this to someone else was too high. So, each of them received the same treatment the first one did; her blade straight through the center of their throat, pulled slightly to the side to ensure it cut into the artery. A quick kill, both depriving of oxygen and a quick bleed out. Not immediate, but close enough. Ellesandra waved her right hand and the haste spell ended on herself even as she turned to look at the woman, blade still drawn. The lethargy from the spell didn't hit as hard this time, considering the restorative magic that had surrounded her from the mage. Not to mention, even as the haste spell ended she could feel the energy from the mage's spell flowing into her in a way the mage probably hadn't expected; the mana of it itself replacing that which Ellesandra had used for her own spell. Ellesandra flicked the tip of her rapier to the side to get rid of most of the blood on it, eyes still on the apparent 'damsel'. She reached back, slipping her hand into a pocket on her bag and pulling out a dirty cloth rag and cleaning the rest of the blood off of the blade, but not speaking. She wanted to see how the woman responded to the men having been killed; she wasn't sure if she would need to defend herself from the mage or not.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The two pirates stood no chance. They had been debilitated. Mercy was an option, but none had shown any degree of remorse in what they were about to do. It was very likely indeed that they would be chasing another to steal from them before long, had they not met their ends. The grass and dirt below was now spattered with sprays and pools of blood. The mana that lingered in the air from Star's spell did very much to soothe and restore the knight before her. With all done, Star's reaction shifted from one of survival, of alert, adrenaline-widened eyes, to...Tears. She slid her arms around her own torso to give herself a self-hug. She bent forward slightly, head slightly hung as she bit her lower lip to try and fight back tears. Small trembles were visible in her frame. Eyes were shut tight. She tried to stifle her sniffles and choked, high-pitched sobs to some degree of success, but whatever was troubling her was still clearly too much for her to bear. Was it just shock? It certainly didn't seem like the first time she'd been in such a situation. So it did beg the question of what could produce such visceral and obvious sorrow in the woman.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra finished cleaning her rapier, eyes still on the woman now...crying. She wasn't quite sure how to approach or make the woman feel better; comforting a stranger was both not something she was comfortable with, or good at. Not to mention, suspicion was still heavily apparent. This could still very well be a trap, a way to ease her into thinking the woman was harmless. After that magic, Ellesandra wasn't going to let her guard down around the woman, at least not entirely. Sliding the rapier back into it's sheath, she stepped back to drag the men to the side and out of sight of the woman at least, since the death of others was likely to be a traumatizing factor if this woman hadn't seen death before. Staring at their dead bodies wouldn't help. It wasn't until after they were moved to the side that Ellesandra stepped back up towards the woman, and spoke. "You're safe now, miss. Did they injure you badly, anywhere?" There had been blood on the woman, though Ellesandra hadn't been able to get a good enough read on how injured she might have been. "I have some medical supplies in my pack, if you need them, but it also seems like you may be able to take care of the injuries via magic if that's easier for you?"


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star had been quietly seeking her center while the knightly woman saw to putting the bodies out of the way in the nearby bushes. The vultures would certainly be along in the days to come if nobody found the corpses to deal with them. Nearby townsfolk would be unlikely to care enough to give these lawless bandits any proper rites. As Star cried, a soft blue aura slowly came over her. It was difficult to discern what the aura signified, but it was similar to the one she had when she attacked prior. Except...It swiftly shifted from its usual azure colour to a tumultuous mix of darker blues, reds, and purples. The colours certainly seemed to hold some sort of meaning, but...To an untrained eye it was little more than just what it was - a multicoloured aura. But as the bodies were tended to, as Star was given time, the colours slowly returned to a steady, azure blue. This coincided with Star's sobs and tears subsiding quite directly, to the point that when the aura was again one uniform colour, she had returned to steady breaths. She wiped at her eyes, taking measured breaths through her mouth to keep herself steady, then looked at Ellesandra when they spoke to her. She managed a half-smile and a nod at the notion of being safe, then a shake of the head at the question of being injured badly. "Just caught my cheek with their blade," she said, finally speaking. She had a gentle voice. Feminine and sweet, though still very subtly shaken. "That's very kind of you to offer. I can handle this small wound myself, though, you're right," she said, then moved one hand up to her own cheek. The tips of her fingers touched the wound, briefly glowing with soft white light once touching the wound. A few seconds of this passed, and when her fingers then removed again from the wound, it had ceased to be, leaving the skin unblemished and without so much as a mark to speak of. The streaks of red, the reminder of where the wound once was, remained, however. There was little sense wasting mana on what a wet cloth could accomplish, in her mind. She then moved her hands to her dress skirt, in all its feathery frills, and pinched either side with either hand to lift as she bowed in a pleasant curtsy to Ellesandra. "Thank you, as well, for coming to my aide. My name is Star Lumina. I typically travel with someone else who acts as my guardian, but..." She raised from the curtsy, then looked away from the other woman as discomfort overtook her face. "They are, erm...Indisposed...For the foreseeable future. I must admit I may have grown too comfortable with the safety that guardianship had afforded me, and thus complacent about how dangerous the realms can be." She returned her gaze to Ellesandra, a tiny blush coming over her cheeks at her honest admission. Despite having clearly powerful magic, she was, without a doubt, out of her depth.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had eyed the magical aura around Star cautiously, but hadn't made a move to stop whatever it was. When she watched the woman seem to gather herself and heard the sweet, feminine voice there was a momentary gut wrenching flashback. Guilt, pain, and grief hit her once again, hard enough that she actively took a step back from Star. Her jaw clenched and she fought it down, reminded herself that this was not the same. This woman - Star, she'd called herself - was not dying. If anything, she was more just traumatized by the experience, most likely. Taking a deep breath to help center her own emotions, Ellesandra nodded.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star noticed the reaction. She had noticed the distrust initially. She noticed it all. She couldn't understand the cause, only that her voice, something about her words, had caused a reaction. The shift of Elesandra's aura, the sudden pulse of heavy matte greys that bore down on them like a boulder. It evoked a sympathetic expression, though such expression would not give away that she could see more than the knight knew she could. "...I might have been able to, I just..." she blushed again, hands folded before her as she looked at the ground before her in...Shame? "I hesitated. Even though those men would have hurt me, I had hoped to get away without causing them harm." She gently shook her head with a sad chuckle. "I must sound pathetic," she said, looking back up to Ellesandra. "I could never ask to burden you with my protection, Miss Rhinelander. But I must...Also concede that it would be a great boon to me." She then pointed past Ellesandra, to the north-east. "...I was heading to Cloverport, just an hour's walk north-east from here, when these pirates intercepted me on the road. The main road just west of here will lead there. Though, erm...That is just a single stop in my journey." She lowered her arm, then took a deep breath and looked at Ellesandra more directly again. "...Perhaps it is foolhardy of me, but...The journey I am undertaking is one that I cannot abandon, no matter the perils I may face. So...Whatever aide you offer to me, I will only be able to selfishly accept." Some guilt, an emotion Ellesandra clearly knew well, overtook Star at that admission. A bold, assertive claim; for better or worse, she would not give up on whatever this quest of hers was.


Ellesandra 

The woman seemed to blush a lot. Was that attraction, or embarrassment? Ellesandra would assume the latter. Crossing her arms, she stood with her feet wide and looking up slightly at the woman, head tilted to the side. Her eyes were narrowed in what looked like a suspicious gaze, though the suspicion was much lower than it had been when she first encountered the pirates and Star. "I am not sorry for killing them, though I am sorry if my doing so caused you distress, Miss Lumina." The fact Star had hesitated because she hadn't wanted to kill the men was foolish, but Ellesandra fully understood that some people just didn't have it in them - especially some soft mages, like this woman seemed to be. Ellesandra had never seen magic like Star's, but that wasn't surprising; there were many kinds of magic in the world. After Star had commented on her current destination, and implied that it was only one stop on the journey, Ellesandra frowned. "First of all, it is not pathetic to require or admit you need help." A lesson that Ellesandra herself could learn from, but it was easier to give advice than follow it. "Foolish to try not to harm them. Even should you have succeeded in escaping, you would have simply left their next victim to it instead, but that would not have been your fault; only theirs." They turned to look in the direction Star had pointed, north-east, then back to her. "I will accompany you to Cloverport should you have my company, Miss Lumina. From there, I am open to be hired, or you may find another guard to hire on your journey should you prefer it. I would not recommend continuing whatever journey you are on alone."


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star gently shook her head at the notion that the killing distressed her. "You have nothing to apologize for, truly," she said, then lowered her head as the brief lecture took place. Her face was that of a woman who understood all that Ellesandra said, but held a heart that stubbornly resisted the wisdom on offer. "You speak the truth. I know that fools who speak only in violence and refuse to hear reason must be spoken to with equal violence." She sighed, moving one hand to rub at her cheek. Understanding the truth was clearly no problem for her. Acting on it? Well, the intuition that some didn't have it in them was surely only reinforced by her reaction. She reset her posture and nodded to Ellesandra. "I...Am not exactly flush with coin. Hardly able to afford a brilliant knight as yourself, but...I appreciate your kindness in escorting me at least that far." She smiled. A quiet fear lingered behind her smile for what the future would bring, but her thankfulness was clear. Indeed, it was...Remarkably easy to discern Star's feelings at just a glance. To say she wore her heart on her sleeve didn't cut it - she held her heart out in both hands for all to see clearly, plainly, without needing to read deeper. Be it happiness, embarrassment, anger, sadness...Her face, her body language, was all unusually animated to the point that this woman had zero hope of ever hiding her true feelings from anyone who paid attention. A grinning, silver-tongued rogue she most certainly was not; such an image was her absolute antithesis.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra huffed softly, closing her eyes and then letting out a resigned sigh. She wouldn't say it, or offer it yet, but the idea of continuing with Star had already come into her head. Could she let this woman go off on her own for whatever misadventure and stubborn ideas she had in mind? It'd be all but letting her die, and it wasn't as if Ellesandra had anywhere else in specific to be. Still, she wasn't going to make that offer now; perhaps after seeing Star to the next town, and getting a better understanding of her and potentially her goal. Wiping her hands off in front of her, a physical attempt to wipe off the thought of killing those men and shrug it off, Ellesandra nodded towards the road. "Well, unless you need anything else here, we might as well get onto the road, Miss Lumina." Ellesandra would motion with a hand for Star to take the lead. "I will be right behind you and will ensure no one else might be around waiting for these three to return." It was possible; if these weren't their own small band of bandits they might have come from some local group that would be looking if they didn't return quickly. Ellesandra still had a stoic, cold look on their face, having not smiled once during their interaction. If anything, she looked tired - though that certainly wasn't a physical exhaustion.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star gently nodded to the notion that they should leave. She moved back the way she was being chased. Not a fully trodden road, but a wilderness path that had seen some foot traffic regularly enough to stomp down the underbrush to easily passed terrain existed. Nature-walkers likely made frequent passage. The walk along it wasn't terribly long, some ten minutes before they were back on the road properly. No other pirates could be seen passing or coming up behind them, though given the proximity to Cloverport, Ellesandra's vigilance wasn't unwarranted. Star allowed Ellesandra to take either the lead, the side, or behind her, whichever they felt most appropriate for escort. The town of Cloverport was vaguely visible on the horizon; a port-side town connected to a horseshoe-shaped lake that connected outward into the greater ocean. The rounded cove had natural defenses, and smaller encampments with ballistae defenses and guard towers could be seen dotting the edge of the lake. A mercantile hub, one that clearly had the potential to send pirate ships to the bottom of the ocean. So it begged the question of why these pirates had been ignored, to any astute onlooker. That all aside, they had a bit of walking to do, and no company but each other and the nearby woodland critters. Star stole occasional glances at Ellesandra, as if...Studying them. Then, set eyes forward with some pensive look upon her, only to look back at the knight again, once again studying them with curiosity, even if that meant rather obviously looking over her shoulder at them.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had followed along behind while in the woods so as to keep a better eye on Lumina, a duty that she took seriously now that she had agreed to take it on. When they got out to the road, she waited until Lumina began walking in the direction of the town to confirm it was the right direction before moving to fall into step beside Lumina. Ellesandra's caution was still up, especially considering what they'd just encountered; she kept her eye out and glanced around to the surrounding woods, behind them towards where they'd come from, and then down to the port city. If pirates had come from there, either they'd gone under the radar - which would be hard with how they were dressed - or the port city supported them in some way, which would make it quite dangerous as well. She looked over to Star, catching the woman studying her again, and let out a soft sigh. "If you have questions Miss Lumina, ask. There is no reason to to walk in silence if you have things to discuss." While Ellesandra herself was not much of a conversationalist, she also knew that after a situation like what just happened, having a conversation could help distract the woman from the trauma. Not only that, but get to know Ellesandra well enough to trust her with her protection. Ellesandra had just killed three men in front of her; it was entirely possible Star was thinking she was some cold blooded killer. She couldn't do her job well if Star didn't let her in or trust her with accurate information about their goals and destination.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star was hardly surprised that she got caught staring. She wasn't being very subtle, after all. She scratched at her cheek, showing another flush of embarrassment for being called out on it. "S-Sorry," she began. "I don't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything, just..." She paused here, focusing on Ellesandra for a short while. Eyes that seemed to peer into Ellesandra's very soul. Indeed, she very well might be. She then shook her head. "I don't wish to pry into your personal matters. So please...Feel free to pretend I've said nothing at all...But I simply cannot ignore the weight I see bearing down on your shoulders. As if a mountain rests upon each of your pauldrons. I know it isn't my place, but...I cannot help that my heart tugs in my chest upon seeing it." She offered a smile at the conclusion of her words. A sympathetic smile. "I'm sure there are a thousand lighter topics to fill the air with as we walk...But the least I can do after being saved by you is offer you my ear, if talking might at all ease the weight. I know things are hardly so simple...But I can't help but extend the offer regardless."


Ellesandra 

She didn't know what she had expected, but being asked about the 'weight on her shoulders' was not one of them. She'd thought Star was shy and wanted to get to know her, not that she could see through to Ellesandra's soul. Could she? Ellesandra frowned, the defensiveness and caution rising again. She also seemed to pull within herself, walls raising to protect herself from the question. "There is no mountain." Her voice came out in a snap, harsh and discordant. It was unintentional, not having intentionally set out to be rude to Star, but the fact that they had JUST met and she was prying into something she very much did not earn information to? Ellesandra closed herself up, jaw clenching and eyes focused straight forward rather than looking over to Star and seeing how her harsh words might have effected her. "And nothing to lend an ear for. I am here to ensure you get to Cloverport, not to share my life story." She wanted to clench her fists, to cross her arms, to distance herself more from Star, but she restrained that. She didn't want to intimidate the woman into not feeling comfortable with her, and distancing herself didn't make sense when it was her job to ensure she was safe. It was best to stay close for that purpose. She opened her mouth to ask Star a question of her own, just to redirect the topic, but then closed it. She didn't know what to ask, and didn't feel like it was appropriate to do so if she herself had just denied truly answering a question asked of her.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Perhaps surprisingly, Star didn't react poorly to Ellesandra closing off. Her smile remained, and her expression quietly spoke of how the response was expected. Her eyes also showed knowledge that refuted Ellesandra's lies. No mountain, they insisted, as Star saw it plain as day crumbling down upon their shoulders in crashing waves of grey and black, like tar clinging to them and making every movement twice as weighted. "I did say I aimed not to pry, and you were welcome to pretend I'd said nothing," she said, keeping her smile. Her eyes returned forward, then, as she continued. "Allow me, then, to give a bit more context to my journey, so you might have something to listen to as we walk." She kept her eyes forward. Her expression showed a smile, a force of strength. But there was a pain that lingered under that smile, shown with a plain openness that stood a firm foil to Ellesandra's closed off stance. "Humour me for a moment, if you will, and consider what you might know to be the rarest magic you've ever known. Even if you aren't exposed to much of the world of magic, I'm sure a knight like yourself has come to see some things more common than others. A fireball is perhaps the most ubiquitous magic there is. That would fall under the school of 'Evocation'. Evoking the forces of nature, of the elements. Controlling flames, winds, lightning, all things of that sort. Next you might consider more esoteric magics like...Teleportation, revival, necromancy. Still common enough, their power and nature notwithstanding, to be known on the common tongue. Take a step further, and you might get into magic that is known only to a select group of people, like druidic magic. Step further, and you enter the world of mystics. People whose magic starts to become as unique as the individual themselves. And when we arrive into that circle, that's, well...About where you might find me. Where other magic users might have dozens, hundreds of other magi, and thousands of books to reference about others like them that have come before that wielded the same magic as them..." She paused again, taking in a slow breath. "...There's only one other person in the whole world who I've ever known that has the same magic as me. And it is imperative that I find them again, not only to hope to preserve this magic of ours, but also, to a smaller extent, for my own sake. For closure, and for the potential betterment of my own understanding of myself, and my magic. If they are still alive, they are the only person who can guide me on using my magic to its fullest. And if they are dead...Then..." She struggled to form the words that encapsulated her feelings on this matter. "...Then I need to know. Because I cannot move on until I do."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra didn't know what to say as Star pointed out that she could have just ignored the question. It was true, she could have, but her instinct had been to snap back. Push the woman away to make her think asking about that wasn't acceptable. The right thing to do probably would have just been ignoring her, but she was never quite so good at ignoring her emotions in instinct. In time she could repress them, surely, but that just made her angry overall. A deep breath was taken, not looking over at Star or seeing the pain in her eyes at all. In fact, Ellesandra looked everywhere EXCEPT at Star, knowing she'd probably gone too far with the harsh words. Yet, the mage had continued on to explain things as if they hadn't been harsh at all. "I certainly haven't seen magic like yours before." Ellesandra admitted, taking the bone Star had thrown her in regards to the topic change. There being only one other person in the world who had the same type of magic was probably frustrating when it came to learning it, and perhaps they were even family? Didn't unique magic lines tend to run through family blood? It sounded like a lonely journey, if Star was taking this search on her own. "Is this person you are looking for the guardian you mentioned?" She had mentioned having a guardian who was no longer available. The way it had been phrased was suspicious at the time, though if Star didn't know what happened to them and was searching for them that would explain it. She likely wouldn't want to admit the person might be dead, but also didn't want to hope otherwise. That's how Ellesandra would feel, anyways. The tension had reduced a little, listening to Star speak and asking questions in return. She was still more guarded than even when she first saw Star and the pirates, the question having certainly put her guard up, but it was quickly relaxing back to normal again. The soft clunk of her metal boots hitting the dirt beneath them, along with where her breastplate met her skirt, was a familiar accompanying sound to her walking and pacing.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

"No, not that guardian I mentioned. That guardian's name is Nina. She's an old friend. And half the reason my first instinct to talk about common magics is fireballs," she said with a giggle. "Nina is a kind soul. And a fiery one. Quite literally. She possesses a soul touched by a powerful phoenix, so when I say she is indisposed, well...I mean to say she was killed. I didn't want to start with that because it sounds grim, but that phoenix within her means that she returned to life from her own ashes. A taxing process, but one she will recover from in due time. Alas, that is time I cannot remain idle, hence you finding me on my lonesome," she said, keeping her tone spirited through her words. Truly, as much as it did mean Star did very much need help for the foreseeable future, it was surely heartening to know that her dear friend wasn't truly gone. "In a year or so, she may be able to serve as my guardian again. But in truth? Part of me wishes to allow her to pursue her own life. I don't wish to shackle her with my woes, much as I'm certain she wouldn't characterize it like that," she said, giggling again. A fondness for this friend was obvious. But the two were far, far apart now. "No, the person I'm looking for is, erm...My mother." Star's tone dropped to a more sorrowful one with those words. She couldn't know how close Ellesandra was to guessing the truth before she said it. But it did certainly explain the struggles Star had with the topic. "Her name is Aurora Lumina, not that I expect anyone here to know that name. We are...Not in the right realm for anyone to know her. In fact, the first step of my journey, before I can even begin to try and find her again is...Finding a way to return home, to where I was born. To where my mother most likely is, whether she still lives or not. A far more difficult task than simply finding the path on a map and walking it, I'm afraid."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra finally glanced back at Star when she mentioned her friend, Nina, had died. Even if she was a phoenix and apparently returning to life, in some form or fashion, losing a friend couldn't be great. "Sorry to hear." Ellesandra's words were soft, spoken with a pain and sympathy of one who has known loss. And unfortunately for Ellesandra, this loss wasn't one that returned to life after a time. Looking back forwards, Ellesandra rested her right hand on the top of her rapier hilt while they walked, thumb and finger lightly tapping into the metal in a tick that she didn't even realize she had, but one that provided comfort for her all the same. "I've not heard of this Mrs. Lumina." Ellesandra confirmed in regards to not knowing the name. The right realm comment made Ellesandra glance sideways to her again before she continued. "So do you have a specific destination in which you will be able to return to your own realm? Also, if I may ask, you mentioned needing to find your mother in order to ensure your magic doesn't die out. Would you not be able to sustain your magic by having kids of your own, or is your magic not passed down via blood?" She paused, then quickly added. "If you don't mind sharing. I understand many mages, especially those of particularly unique blood lines, are sensitive to the secrets their magic may carry. I have no desire to pry into it." Ellesandra herself was a simple spellsword; she was capable of other magics, but not talented at it. The only unique magic she had was that of being able to reutilize the mana, energy within a spell; to absorb it, though she had never known where that particular ability came from.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star sputtered at the notion of her having children. Her face was now emulating the ripest of tomatoes. "W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Well...A-Ah, uhm, you see, I...Uhm...That is...Aaah...Uhm..." This stammering continued for a short while. She tapped her index fingers together, idly spun some of her snow-white hair around one index, and idly fidgeted with her hands in general while trying to answer that question. "...I-It is, well, passed through lineage, s-so, that much is true! B-But the ideal would s-still be that I, erm...H-Have a little guidance on the matter before I go...Thinking about...T-That..." Her words quieted to a whisper by the end of that. There was other matters to discuss, but the notion of children had thrown Star for such a loop that the rest got lost in translation, and now she was just...Silently steaming in her own head while waiting for the knight's reply, still as bright red in the cheeks as could be.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had not expected the notion of kids to fluster the mage so. She looked over and for the briefest of seconds, amusement passed through them. There was even a very small uptick to the corner of their mouth at the sight of Star stammering and going red enough that she looked like steam would come out of her ears. Looking forward, Ellesandra spoke again. "My apologies, Miss Lumina. I did not intend to embarrass you or imply kids were your only option. Many people eschew such things, or are incapable of creating such, and there would be no shame in such." Ellesandra wasn't sure if Star was simply inexperienced and thus flustered at the concept, or if it was embarrassment for a reason such as being unable to. It didn't matter; apparently the topic had been quite intense for Star, so Ellesandra felt the need to apologize. The amusement had faded quickly, only showing briefly, but it did lighten Ellesandra's mood a little. Her guard was still up, but it wasn't being held up firmly; it was more that Ellesandra's natural state was to have it up as she went about her daily life.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star needed a bit of time to recoup from that, but her blush was going to be sustained for a little while as she tried to move those thoughts out of her mind to refocus on other topics. She gently shook her head. "N-No, it's okay. It's not your fault. I-I suppose I just, well, had never really focused on that quite as much. N-Not even so much romantic prospects, l-let alone.." She shook her head again, more vigorously this time. A soft huff followed as she sought composure once more. She wasn't about to go on to say how she was perfectly capable, or so she assumed, or other embarrassing subjects about herself with this woman she'd just met, mostly because it would be a little too much information, so she sought to pivot. "A-Anyway...U-Uhm." Deep breath. "I, er...I want to understand myself, first and foremost, is I suppose the point I'm getting at. Not that I'm...Going to turn away from any romantic prospects that might arise, but for the moment I have a clear direction that has made maintaining long-standing friendships...Difficult. There are many who are not cut out for a vagrant life rife with dangers, and there's no shame in that. I just...Hope to brighten the lives of those I encounter, when I do encounter them, you know?" She asked with a smile. The two were getting closer to the city. The sun was still high in the sky, so there were plenty of hours of daylight left for them to make use of. Another ten or so minutes of walking and they would hit the outskirts.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had to bite back her initial response of calling Star on her...inexperience. Not calling so much, but commenting on it and calling her flustered attitude cute. It wasn't appropriate, or needed from a stranger. Instead, she looked off towards the outskirts of the town, keeping an eye out even as they approached. If those pirates had come from here, it was entirely possible there were more. "It is entirely valid to want to find yourself before finding a partner or considering children. And admirable that you recognize it may not be the best time to actively search, Miss Lumina." Her words had gone back to the formal way of speaking, which for her was a more relaxed situation compared to when she'd snapped at the mage. Still, Ellesandra would change the topic - both for Star to not get too embarrassed, and also to redirect their thoughts to the path ahead. "We are near the city and have daylight to burn. Did you have a plan upon arriving, a ship you were intending to get on? If not, I would recommend finding a place to stay for the night before travelling on to the next location, we're far enough along in the day that starting off now wouldn't be entirely wise, especially considering the attack that already happened on this road."


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star showed the appreciation in her face at the change of topic. Some time for her to cool off. She nodded to the question about a plan. "Mmn. There's someone in town I'm meeting. I was told they might have information about how to get to the next leg of my journey. I...Somehow doubt it will be a straight forward affair, and may not be without its cost, but...I will figure something out once I meet them. I was referred to someone named Morrun Dayflower. A high elven scholar who had some information about a lead I was chasing. All sounds very vague, I'm sure, but when we sit down with him I'm sure it'll make more sense. I don't intend on getting on a ship, though, no. Unless the next destination requires it. And I do have enough money for a night at an inn, assuming they are keeping reasonable prices, if we need to stay around. That being said, if the pirates are making this place a home, I might sooner find camp among the trees if there are no storm clouds this night. Not that I don't feel infinitely safer around someone like you, but, I would not shackle you to a night if you have somewhere else to be," she said, offering a genuine smile at Ellesandra. "I'm not one for needless conflict, regardless. The sight of death disturbs me greatly, even if I know in my mind it was righteously done."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra was surprised, and considered commenting, on Star's use of 'we'. Was she taking for granted that Ellesandra would accompany her for such? She had only technically agreed to see her to the city safely, though Star had a good point that if the city was overtaken by pirates it might be safer to sleep outside of the city. After listening to the rest, she decided not to call Star out on her assumption that Ellesandra would join her. For now, she would. Instead she ran the name Morrun Dayflower through her mind to figure out if she had heard of them. She hadn't, but she'd met many a mage in one of her last jobs and sometimes had to focus on trying to think of them and who all she met. "What exactly was your plan, if you were to run out of money? Surely you didn't expect to be able to find your mother so quickly on limited funds, if you're at the point of commenting about having enough money to stay the night at an inn." Typically, that was a given for travelers. If Star were so hard up on coin to make that an active consideration, Ellesandra couldn't imagine how she was planning to finish her journey entirely on her own. "And you mentioned a cost from this Morrun for getting you to the right realm as well." They added in consideration for that. Was Star just going on a whim and hoping things fell into place? Ellesandra felt both an irritation at such foolishness, and a protectiveness of the naivety of it.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star gently shook her head. "I've always been able to find work healing. It's just been a long road since I was in a major settlement. I admit there are times I will pass up compensation for what I do when I'm in a squalid town. There's little joy in taking from those who live in houses with roofs in disrepair that catch the rainwater in pots, and have to grovel to the local lords come time for tax collection, even if I myself am hard off. A place like Cloverport is sure to have more work for me; I simply meant to say that extortionist prices aren't worth the comfort when I am well-enough accustomed to life among nature," she said, hoping her correction put things in better perspective. She had coin, she just had to ration it. A mindset for the long term, rather than the immediate. Suffering now for comfort later. "I've been searching for my mother for several years now. Since I was nineteen, in fact. I'm twenty-three now. Before that, I did what I could to find any information about my magics. I'm sure you can imagine with my previous comments how well that went," she said, giving a soft grin at the notion. "As for the cost, well. I don't suspect it will be coin. Often, magi trade in lore, artifacts, or services. I do not know what Morrun will want. Speculation helps me little. The best I can do is step forward, be open and honest, and see where that path will take me. Of course...The years traveling have made me better able to know when that approach is best substituted for a more...Evasive one. But I guess you'll just have to trust me when I tell you I have a pretty infallible eye for when someone has less than pure intentions. I knew from the moment I saw you that I could trust you, after all, even before you challenged the pirates. And I could tell you didn't exactly trust me right away." She kept a smile about her as she spoke so plainly about this. "I don't blame you, of course. I'm a strange woman with strange magic, and these roads can be dangerous to everyone, even someone as stalwart as yourself."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra felt surprise, and a little bit of shame at how quickly she'd jumped to assumptions about Star. Apparently, she'd thought this out more than she'd thought originally. Nodding along to the explanation Star gave, and the apparent soft heart she had, Ellesandra felt herself thankful that she'd happened upon the bandits ambush in time. Someone like Star seemed to be the type of person this world needed more of, and it would have been quite a shame if those men had decided to kill her. "I apologize, Miss Lumina, for my assumption then. You seem to have prepared and planned for this more than I initially expected." She listened as Star explained how she had a good eye for someone's intentions, and that she could tell Ellesandra had not trusted her. She still didn't trust Star, not entirely anyways. She trusted Star not to randomly attack her, or maybe not to try to steal her purse, but she didn't really trust the mage yet. It would take more than a single conversation on an hour's long walk to get to that. "I mean no offense to you, of course Miss Lumina, for my lack of trust. It's entirely focused on experience, not that you seem untrustworthy." A nod was given to the idea of the strange magic. "And not understanding your magic doesn't help with that. But then again, magic isn't the best way to take me out, considering my own abilities around it." She was vague on purpose, not wanting to make it so that Star would understand enough to be able to work around such abilities.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

"I did say I don't blame you, didn't I?" she said, smiling at Ellesandra. She clearly took no offense. "You wouldn't be the first person to assume me some naiive, innocent woman. And while I do indeed hold good intentions for any who share those towards me, I am also aware that it has the duality of both...Inviting evil-doers to take advantage, as well as...Lulling those same evil-doers into consistently underestimating me. I do...Very much detest having to use my powers for harm. But I must, at times, as a last resort. Being outnumbered, however is...Still a major disadvantage." She gave another smile. Would she have come out of that okay? Maybe. But the likely scenario was that she took far more grievous wounds in the process. Her minimal injury remained possible thanks to the knight at her side. She took note of how Ellesandra was...Not a prime target for magic, and took note of this in the back of her mind, but did not press the issue. The two had arrived at the city outskirts at this point. The port city was busy, but not overly bustling. Guards at the gate stood in towers with crossbows; a stone perimeter wall surrounded the whole of the city. Things looked to be business as usual. Once inside the gates, the port to the east was the primary attraction, but the north and western faces of the city had plenty of businesses. A tavern, an inn, a smith, a breadmaker, several clothiers that sported sail-related signage that were doubtlessly adept at mending torn ship sails, among several other more niche businesses. But as the two moved through the city, one thing would be clear: The red and white striped shirts of the pirates featured on many others within the city. No ship in the port was flying the Jolly Roger flag, but...These pirates had gotten into the city, and were pervasive through it. They appeared to be keeping lawful, though some less than subtle cat-calls were made at Ellesandra and Star from the periphery. Star chose to ignore them and step onwards, aiming to head towards The Salty Salmon tavern, which appeared to be quite the main attraction at the center of the city. But if the knight saw fit to cause a scene, Star would stick by their side through it.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra knew Star had said she didn't blame her, but that didn't mean she shouldn't be polite and apologize for such an expectation. She continued walking while listening to Star's explanation, feeling their gut tighten at the thought. "If only everyone had expectations of said duality." The words were mumbled to herself, not necessarily intended for Star to hear. The guilt intensified, fully wrapping around a core of sorrow that settled deep in her gut. She took a deep breath, and the emotions bundled up and were pushed down, being well and truly ignored once again. She'd gotten quite good at that. As they made their way into the city, Ellesandra became more on guard. They made sure to walk a bit closer to Star, ensuring any onlookers knew they were together and not just walking side by side, and that Star was under Ellesandra's protection. She had to resist the temptation to reach out and touch the small of Star's back, a habit in a similar situation in her past. It was interesting how people who looked similar to the pirates, and how multiple of them seemed to be roaming the city. This realization made Ellesandra walk with her right hand resting on the top of the rapier hilt, though she continued walking forward as if there weren't a problem at all. If there was anything she was good at, it was being on guard without looking like she was paranoid or activley watching everything. "You know the way to this contact of yours, Miss Lumina?" She asked, looking straight forward while keeping an eye on both of their purses as they entered the city with more people here and there. Cat calls were entirely ignored; it would only bring attention to them if they did anything about it prior to the callers getting more aggressive.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

"I was told to meet them here," she said, gesturing to The Salty Salmon tavern that was soon before them. The bustle of the core of the city could be heard from here, mostly as a dull roar in the background. Closer to the ports sat an open-air market that held most of the congestion of the city. Things of all nature being traded, possibly even less legal things in the darker corners. If the two should have to travel through that space, coin-purses would need near constant supervision, surely. Ignoring that, Star had kept an eye on Ellesandra as much as they kept an eye on everyone else. Star did have a habit of staring, it seemed. Whatever she might be looking at would remain a mystery for the time being, but she certainly seemed to be looking for, or at...Something. That attention stopped when they reached the tavern and pushed inside. The interior was decently busy. Not too many free tables, and the happy jaunt of a bard strumming a lute somewhere on the left side of the interior could be heard. A sea shanty, it seemed, as the lyrics waxed on about woes of a life at sea, hungry bellies and wet clothes in chasing a golden payday. Star took a rather direct route through the tavern to the right and towards the back. Seemed she had been given a precise meeting place. She joined a lone elven man at his table that had room for four. The man eyed Ellesandra, however, with a look that suggested they were an unexpected addition to the meeting. "Morrun?" asked Star. The elven man nodded. In the dull light of the tavern, Morrun's darker, moonlight-toned complexion made the shadows cling tightly to him. He was quite tall, clearly, but quite thin as well. Spectacles made his dull brown eyes larger than they were while looking at him. His brown hair was in a tight ponytail, though his hair wasn't terribly long. "Star, I take it?" asked the man in return. Star nodded. "And this is Ellesandra. She has graciously been my escort to the city," she said, notably keeping the introduction in line with their agreement. To the city, and nothing more. Morrun gave a small hum of acknowledgement. "Right. Well. I heard you were looking for magic that could help you divine a location, and then presumably get there," asked the elven man, his expression rather neutral as the two discussed business. He didn't give away much of anything in the way of what he might be thinking or feeling beyond the initial surprise of Ellesandra's presence, but he quickly accepted that as well. Star nodded to the man's summation. "That's about right. I was told you had information on the matter," Star replied. Morrun nodded. "Aye. I've got a lead for you. Not directly the magic you're looking for, but...A nugget. A trail you can follow that will get you closer to it," he said, then drew in a swift sniff. He eased back in his chair, crossing his arms. His arms, like the rest of him, were thin. The frame of a scholar, not a fighter. He had a pack by his feet which presumably contained some of his materials; the wooden ends of a scroll were visible poking out of the top if one leaned to look under the table to spy it. "...But I've got two conditions." He struck a stern expression as he said this. Preparing for pushback on the notion, perhaps, and ready to meet it firmly. Star didn't respond immediately, instead...Eyeing the man in a way that was vaguely similar to the way she studied Ellesandra along the way to the city. Just looking at him, as if she saw something. Whatever the case, it gave a pause in the conversation, if Ellesandra had anything to add.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra felt relieved when they reached their destination. Being inside a tavern might not be entirely safe either, but at the very least she wouldn't have to keep an eye on all the crowd. Normally this wasn't as bit of an issue, but with the pirates and the encounter Star had previously had with them already Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable with any of them. She did notice Star watching her, but didn't think anything of it, assuming this was simply Star being cautious about her as well, or finding something interesting. Perhaps her armor, or her demeanor or something? There were even some people who were interested in the color of her hair at a young age, though based on Star's own hair that was unlikely. She nodded, and let Star lead them into the tavern with a glance at the sign and name hanging before them. Salty Salmon seemed like a perfect name for a tavern in a port city, playing up to the fisherman or pirate customers. She followed Star in and did a quick sweep of the room, eyes scanning different doors and potential exits other than the front door just in case anything went down that required a quick escape. The fact they walked to the back corner of the room made Ellesandra uncomfortable, as it was likely going to put their backs to the rest of the room. She made no attempt to hide her perusal of the man sitting, also eyeing her. A quick assessment of any weapons that were obvious on his form, and then only giving him a brief nod when Star introduced her. As the two began to discuss business, Ellesandra stepped around the table, to the side. This put her a bit further from Star, but it allowed her the ability to keep an eye both on the room and on this man, Morrun, without having to constantly turn her head or look behind her. It also placed her back to one of the walls, which was ideal. Her arms crossed, listening into the conversation while taking up a practiced bodyguard's unseeing stare past Star. An illusion of privacy, as if Ellesandra wasn't there listening even if she was. Her lips were pressed into a thin line at the conditions comment, though no response given. This was Star's business to deal with.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The pause in conversation lasted a few moments, Star and the elven man eyeing one another closely. Star eventually nodded. "Very well, what are they?" she asked, her voice more or less unchanged. She had mentioned expecting this, so it was likely little surprise how calmly she received it. Morrun gave a terse nod, then laid out his conditions: "First, five thousand gold pieces. Upfront. Non-negotiable," he said, his voice firm. Considering that a skilled bodyguard like Ellesandra could expect between one and at most five gold pieces per day for their services as a very well accomplished knight, and that a night's stay at the local inn was only eight silver - with ten silver to one gold - a price of five thousand gold was laughable. Absurd. A small fortune, and for what? Vague information? Despite the absurdity, Star said nothing, allowing the man to continue. "...And the other is that if your exploration of my valuable information bears fruit, I require a full report of your findings for my own study." By contrast, a far more reasonable request, though still arguably pompous on the man's part. Star gave another pause. She then tilted her head slightly. "What do you need the gold for?" she inquired simply. The man's brows knit and he leaned forward on the table, supported on his elbows. "The information I have is worth as much! It's none of your business what I use it for," he scoffed back, indignant. Star remained calm and composed in the face of this. She then lowered her voice to a volume that would make it so only the man and Ellesandra would be able to overhear: "...Why are you lying?" she asked, causing the man to grit his teeth and leer at Star. "Wh...What are you talking about? I've said no word of a lie!" he insisted, his tone hushing to match hers. His eyes then began to dart around, looking at some of the other patrons in the bar. Those patrons in question didn't seem to take notice of the discussion, though with Ellesandra's watch, it would be easy to pick up on some...Wandering eyes. Certain folk in the tavern were carrying on about their business with their tablemates, but also occasionally did look over at the table with Star and Morrun. Not directly spying, but...Seemed their meeting had some interest to certain folk present, who were trying - and failing - to be subtle about it. At least failing under the scrutiny of the experienced knight, that is. Nobody was standing up. Nobody was encroaching. But people were watching. Possibly listening. But there'd be no listening in on the current hushed voices. "You are lying," said Star, still hushed. "You grew nervous talking about the condition of gold. You were calm talking about the second condition, however. And when I asked you what the gold was for, you had a very large rise in anxiety. And now as I'm explaining to you how I know you're lying, your anxieties are getting stronger. You're...Scared about something. Guilty, as well," she went on to explain, her voice still kind as ever, even as she dissected the man's heart like it was laying on the table. If Ellesandra had been observing the man, they would not have been able to notice any clear tells about anything Star was saying. Perhaps Star was just bluffing? Morrun looked visibly shaken by this, however. "W-What are you doing? Reading my mind or something?!" he asked, keeping his voice low despite his clear anxiety. Star smiled and shook her head. "No. But that does say rather plainly that I am right, doesn't it?" she replied, still smiling. "If you'd just be honest, then perhaps I can help you. Because I certainly don't have five thousand gold to my name." Another pause in the conversation appeared, as the man was sent reeling and deliberating. His nervous demeanor, however, had earned the scrutiny of a pirate-looking fellow at another table. A suspicious eye trained on Morrun, suggesting some manner of...Investment in the elven man's dealings.


Ellesandra 

Was Star able to read people? not minds, Ellesandra didn't expect that was possible if she'd gotten into the position she'd been in before. She could have used that against the pirates if so, or maybe not even have gotten caught. But some people were just empaths, able to easily read someone's body language and tell how they were feeling. Was that why Star had kept looking at her during their walk? Could she tell that Ellesandra was working through her guilt at the memories Star brought up? Her jaw clenched at the thought, glancing towards Morrun for a moment to ensure that he didn't respond poorly at being called out, then back out into the tavern room. The pirate looking fellow keeping a suspicious eye on Morrun had her guard up, and though she obviously looked at him once when she first noticed him, she didn't keep an eye directly on him. Doing so would only alert him that she'd caught him staring with too much interest. Instead, she began looking at other tables, both to keep him in peripheral vision and also to see if there were any others that were looking towards the pirate man, or also looking towards their table. She did lean down briefly to whisper to Star, completely ignoring Morrun. "Heads up, Miss Lumina, your contact here has the active interest of at least one pirate in the tavern." It was a validation of what Lumina was saying, as well as encouraging Morrun to put his cards on the table. He couldn't exactly deny it at this point, not with how well Star had read him and that Ellesandra had called out he was being actively watched. Whether or not he actually did so would be up to him, but most would understand that sharing that information would be beneficial to getting any actual business done.



<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

A brief time passed as Morrun weighed his options. Star leaned into the whisper that Morrun was certainly intended to hear as well, and nodded. She looked at him, once more studying him. Eventually, his conviction broke, and he sighed. "...Look," he began, quiet as he could be while still being audible. "The pirates. They took my wife. They tried to extort me, and when I said I didn't have the gold, they took her as...Collateral," he said, nearly spitting the final word. "They want five thousand gold as ransom, or who knows what they'll do. Who knows what they've already done," he said, moving his left hand up to push through his hair. A golden wedding band with green etching depicting an elvish phrase was on his ring finger. Not immediately obvious in the dim light, but visible if one was looking for it. Star's expression softened dramatically, not that it was ever particularly hard in the first place. Star moved to touch the thin lines of dried blood that were on her cheek, briefly closing her eyes as she did. "Mmn. I'm no stranger to their barbarity. I'm very sorry to hear that has happened to you, Morrun. I will get her free again for you and get her out of the city. So you'll do well to find a way to slip out without attracting attention." Just like that, Star was jumping head-first into what was obviously a dangerous situation. Not counting the deck-hands on the ship itself, the city had plenty more of a pirate presence. Enough to suggest theirs was one of the larger vessels in port. Did Star have a plan? It would be hard to assume she did, given the whole two minutes she had to come up with one. But she'd already proven in the past to be a thoughtful woman...So it would be difficult to know. Naturally, this had Morrun...More than a little skeptical. "Wh- You can't be serious," he said with a chuckle. A chuckle that was asking to be laughed along with. "This is...This is a joke, right?" he continued, looking at Star, then Ellesandra. "L-Look, I obviously want her back, more than anything. But, like...Are ye' blind, woman? Have you not seen how many of them there are? And no offence to either of you, but they've each got as much muscle in their arms as you do in your whole body. And much as your uh, escort there, looks plenty mean...I think you'll be needing about five of her at least to hold your own." Through all of Morrun's doubts, Star never buckled. She maintained an air of serenity and calm about her, as if the danger before her was trivial. It wasn't. She already showed how just three pirates were a danger for her. Was Star truly insane? So determined to do the right thing that she'd carelessly lay down her life just to try? One look at her said very clearly that she wasn't scared, if nothing else..


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra glanced quickly back at Morrun when he mentioned they had taken his wife. A frown creased her face, but that was the only emotion that she displayed for people to see. Displeasure on her face, which could easily have been taken for him making an unreasonable demand. Her eyes narrowed at him for a moment, then looked back out onto the room to keep up guard. It would not, however, be hard for Star to see the anger that burned bright in Ellesandra. There was a desire, briefly, to walk over to the pirate who was keeping an eye on Morrun and just slam his head into the table. She would never do this, of course. She was too well trained and restrained to start something like this, but the desire to do so was there. She hadn't considered how she was going to respond to the situation when Star apparently volunteered to help save the woman. Ellesandra looked back at Star with alarm. "Miss Lumina" She said in protest, placing a hand on the table and partially leaning over it to mask her mouth movements as she spoke. "While I can empathize with wishing to help rescue this man's wife, that is a very dangerous activity to take on." For once, she actually agreed with this Morrun fellow; this had to be a joke. Ellesandra could take on a handful of pirates without magic surely, but a whole ship of them, potentially more? "If they are trained like the ones in the woods I can take on four or five together without magic I think, but a whole ship is pushing it even with magic, Miss Lumina." Nowhere in this had Star volunteered Ellesandra to help with this, but there was an unspoken expectation that Ellesandra was not letting Star do that alone.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star had looked at Ellesandra briefly when the flash of anger rose up within them. Something that might be a little too coincidental. But it was brief and subtle enough to be overshadowed by other things. The tag-team of the elven man and the knight trying to talk her out of this had Star smiling even wider. To the point of giggling under her breath. Her bright, positive outlook was immune in that moment. "Well, there you both go assuming I had planned to fight. I did tell you I'm not so much a fan of doing that, didn't I, Miss. Rhinelander?" she said, mysterious as she was chipper about it all. "I know you're just as angry inside about this situation as I am," she continued, speaking to Ellesandra. "So you can rest just as easy as Morrun here. I'll take care of it. You've already saved me from danger once, so I'll do my absolute utmost to ensure it needn't be twice in one day, all right?"


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra didn't notice the coincidental glance in time with their anger, but they did notice how Star seemed to call her anger out. Her eyebrows knitted in confusion for a moment, wondering if her anger had really been that noticeable on her face. She was usually better at keeping her anger in check on jobs, since it was a pretty important thing to make your client happy with you and if you were expressing anger at them they would feel uncomfortable. Taking a deep breath to work the anger down and mentally scold themselves for being so readable, they looked over to Morrun, then back out into the tavern. "Well, what exactly is your plan then, Miss Lumina? We've had but a few minutes of learning this, don't know what ship they're on or if she's even on the ship." Maybe Ellesandra was jumping to conclusions right now. Perhaps Star only really planned to do some information gathering, not actually go on a rescue mission. That would make more sense. Still, Star was giggling - did she not understand the danger she'd be in if the pirates caught her, based on how many they seem to have seen in town? Sure if so many were in town there might be a chance fewer were on the ship, but they had no idea what numbers they might be looking at.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star took note of the breath. The internal revision. The self-scolding. While Star couldn't know what precisely was going on in the woman's head, she knew enough about emotional patterns to take a solid guess. So it was, Star was left with a knowing, sympathetic smile on her lips. She didn't say a word about it, but looking at her, she certainly seemed to know...Something. But how could she? Had Ellesandra been so plain? Morrun similarly had been quite stalwart in hiding any emotion, and yet Star sniffed it out with only a few moments of that...Curious, studious gaze. How strange, indeed. With all said, Star looked at Morrun. "Can you point out which ship is theirs?" she asked. Morrun hastily nodded. "They've a few in port, but the primary galleon of their fleet is where she's being held," he said, keeping a hush about him to prevent unwanted listeners. "I saw them take her aboard. Couldn't tell you where inside, but...The captain's probably on the ship, too, an' he's a mean fucker. Are you...Sure you know what you're doing? He's not really one to be persuaded by anything but gold," Morrun went on to say. Star gently shook her head. "I wouldn't try to reason with them. Or rather...I already did try to do that, and it didn't work out so well," she said, offering a nervous giggle as she once more called reference back to Ellesandra's intervention. "So? What are you going to do?" he asked, looking at Ellesandra briefly as he echoed their request to know what Star was planning. Star took a moment to collect her thoughts, then nodded to herself. "I'm going to board the ship, find your wife, and take her to the outskirts of the city. The only part I still need to figure out is...How to get you, Morrun, out of the city without raising suspicion. All the pirates in the tavern here are on edge, likely expecting a big payday. They're undoubtedly going to have questions about how our meeting went. So we'll need to have something convincing that keeps them from thinking something is amiss. It might help if we make a louder announcement of agreement, to make it seem like I'm going to abide by the initial terms of payment." While it seemed Star had put a good deal of thought into this, the arguably most important part - the rescue - was something she seemed quite content to just leave at her just...Walking aboard and taking a prisoner away, as if she expected the pirates to be perfectly content with this plan of hers. Once more, Morrun was looking with exceptional uncertainty at Ellesandra, as if seeking confirmation from the knight as to whether Star was sane or not.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra was similarly disappointed with Star's current plan of just walking on board this pirate ship and getting the prisoner. She crossed her arms, her face all but in a permanent frown during this conversation. Ellesandra was also concerned about this supposed captain on board. It took every ounce of her willpower not to ask Star if she had lost her mind, but she had to assume the woman had some sort of plan, right? She didn't seem to be suicidal, considering her mission and determination to find her mother. A glance was given to Morrun, all but meeting his eye and agreeing with him in regards to Star being crazy. Ellesandra considered whether or not she should just walk away. A glance towards the door was given and the thought crossed her mind, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Not only would that likely be condemning the man's wife, but even Star for whatever foolish plan she was going with. "I strongly disagree with this course of action, Miss Lumina. It isn't worth this." Her voice was loud enough to be heard this time. Her words were true, but she also knew that saying such out loud would make the listening in pirates think that Star was planning to actually pay the 5000 gold to Morrun, not that Star was planning to rescue his wife.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

And without missing a beat, Star was right alongside Ellesandra's lead, speaking aloud. "You might disagree with the price of a life, Miss. Rhinelander. But it's obvious. They have all the power, all the control. We'll have to find a way to gather up the money and pay the ransom," she said, smiling a knowing smile at Ellesandra. She then spoke quietly. Quietly enough for just Ellesandra to hear: "Please...Trust me. I won't be dying today," she said, then drew in a slow breath. "Hopefully, nobody else has to die today. I know I have already asked much of you, but...You're much more likely able to defend Morrun if it comes to that. Would I...Be able to rely on you to escort him beyond the city limits, into the northern forests?"


Ellesandra 

Well, Ellesandra wouldn't have gone so far as to talk about the ransom out loud. Maybe just agreeing to the terms about paying the 5,000 for this service. Still, Ellesandra didn't SHOW the surprise on her face, even if she felt it. And a little bit of irritation and worry directed at Star for being so upfront about it. The pirates might not be happy that Morrun had spoken to them of the ransom, rather than just requesting the money from them. A glance was given his way, then back to Star. "I will not let you go face whatever you are doing alone. Not without hearing your plan." And honestly, not likely with that. She wasn't going to let a charge walk into a trap or a dangerous situation, and lose her. Not again. The guilt and sorrow started to bubble up, but it was pushed down again. She couldn't let past mistakes effect her focus now, but she also couldn't help but learn from them. She wouldn't let Star go be reckless on her own.



<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The word 'ransom' did very much perk up the attention of a few pirates. But where any civil city would hear a crime in the midst and call to the guards...It only seemed to embolden the pirates in the Salty Salmon. Chuckles resounded from a few of them. Beer steins clinked together. Hearing 'all the power, all the control' had the pirates donning wide smirks, and even managed to identify a few patrons who broke into grins over the words who were not wearing the same colours. Sympathizers? Undercover agents? It was hard to say. But one thing was certain: The bartender was horrified. Scared for his life as he shakily wiped clean a beer stein. A few clues that one might be able to use to discern that threats and violence had beaten this city into submission. It was, once again, another of Star's appeal to emotion. An attempt to make the pirates feel more secure. The way they had appealed to Ellesandra in the forest, the cocky, arrogant way with which they described their obviously illegal actions, making a mockery of Ellesandra's integrity by exerting force of their presence over those who dared to stand up to them was likely far more effective against those not clad in Ellesandra's knightly attire. Star listened to Ellesandra's request, and it caused Star to don a briefly...Complicated expression. She was studying them again. A bit of wetness then appeared in Star's eyes. Too hard for any but Ellesandra to see given the dim light. But it was there. The start of tears. But Star blinked them away, steadying herself. "Not here," she said, keeping a whisper. "Announce that you have to take me some place to secure the money. Make up something believable, and lucrative. Just something that can buy us time to get somewhere private. I can explain everything there where other ears aren't listening."


Ellesandra 

She took a deep breath, pushing down again on the irritation and concern. She shouldn't be letting those be so visible, even though to anyone but Star they didn't seem to be. Still, Star could seemingly read her face well enough to recognize that Ellesandra was getting more emotional about this than she should. At least, based on the expression Star had given her, Ellesandra assumed that. "Fine." The word came out harshly, as if she were angry at a young child being petulant. That emotion was actually behind it, but Ellesandra wasn't a half-bad actor. "If you insist on throwing your money away for this project, lets at least go and secure the coin so we can ensure it gets into the right hands and isn't pickpocketed on the street. It may not be MY gold, but I'll be damned if I let some two-bit pickpocket make off with it instead of securing our transaction. I know you don't like blood, so I'll warn you now any scoundrel who tries will have my sword through their palm and pinning it to their eye." Okay, that was grotesque, and Ellesandra would not do that. She was not quite so gruesome or ruthless, but pirates respected such threats, didn't they? While Ellesandra was okay with killing someone if she deemed it necessary in a situation, she would never go out of her way to make a scene of it or make it any more painful than it had to be. Well - with one scenario's exception, but she was NOT thinking about that. Stepping back, she looked through the tavern and motioned for Star to get up and lead the way out, keeping up her angry persona with a set jaw and furious eyes that dared anyone in the tavern to reach for either of them.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star lightly winced at the harsh, admonishing words. Her intent was never to upset Ellesandra, and seeing that she did so had clearly affected her. Ellesandra might hide all their pain and emotion as well as they could, but Star continued to do anything but, and took the insight of a five-year-old to determine what she was feeling in most moments. Was she capable of hiding her emotion? Perhaps. She had showed some subtlety when under duress when Ellesandra first happened upon her. And she clearly knew how to tie together a ruse. Was Ellesandra right to hold sincere doubts about Star? To hold back trust? She was hardly a simple woman to figure out. "Keep comfy here, Morrun. We'll come back to find you," she said to the elf. As she stood to join Ellesandra, the effects of the knight's words was clear on the tavern. Pirates specifically avoided making eye contact, chuckling to themselves as the threat hunger over the room. "Oooh, tough girl and her princess, eh?" came one muttering as the two passed by. "Ey, should let cap'n know to double the price. Girlie's got such nice clothes, she obviously can afford it," said another to his comrades. Laughs and chuckling was had at the expense of the two. Star ignored it all, as she presumed Ellesandra would, too. She kept an eye on them, however. Just watching them. Studying them, as she continued to be. Nobody dared reach for or try to stop the two, content to hide behind petty comments. If the two broke away, a some ten minute walk would see them able to reach the north edge of the city, and another five to rise up a lazy hill path to a forested edge, making it look for any onlookers that the two were well and truly departing to some other place to secure the coin. If all went well, she sought out a secure space concealed by the trees, an offshoot from the main path that led to a small pond that gave good concealment among the trees, then turned to Ellesandra to hear their concerns and answer their questions. Of course, if the knight's emotions got the better of them before then and a fight broke out, then Star would have some improvising to do.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had been acting in her anger for the most part, at least for the last bit there. She had been irritated at, and concerned for Star for putting herself in this situation, and there was anxiety in regards to whether this would turn out similarly to past situations like this. However, that anger ignited for real as soon as she'd begun to follow Star out and someone commented on them being a Knight and her Princess. It took every ounce of Ellesandra's willpower not to lash out. The anger and pain that comment had brought up wasn't something most people would be able to tell, of course. It flared in them, the ball of pain fueling the anger at such a comment, at how it cut much, much deeper than Ellesandra would ever admit out loud. Her left hand moved to rest on the rapier upon her right hip, casually threatening to draw it if needed, and squeezing tightly to the hilt in an attempt to keep it busy from just striking one of them on their way to the door. Getting out of the tavern was a breath of fresh air, even if they were still surrounded by potential enemies. Ellesandra didn't let her guard down even as they crested the hill, glancing down below them for a good view of if they had been followed at all. She scanned the area for a moment, taking that time to collect herself and bottle emotions tighter. Star was too similar to Ellesandra's past; as soon as this job was done she needed to move on or this would just keep coming up. Turning, she nodded to Star to begin her explanation.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Indeed, they had not been followed. Star hat noticed very swiftly the correlation between the comment and Ellesandra's anger. She saw it flare up around them like an inferno engulfing them. She held trust in them to keep it under wraps, but the final moments walking out of the tavern were...Tense. It showed on Star once they were in the clear. She was visibly concerned as she looked at Ellesandra. But, an explanation had to come first. She drew in a slow, steadying breath. She then closed her eyes. She extended an arm. A blue aura possessed her arm, slowly shifting around it with wispy lines of mana. Then, she slowly closed her hand into a fist. The aura, once a soft, sky blue, became a shimmering beacon of scintillating colours. A rainbow, kaleidoscopically shimmering with a trillion different colours. It covered from her fingertips to her shoulder. She was clearly concentrating on this. Her eyes opened, looking at Ellesandra. "...Strike my arm, Miss. Rhinelander. Hard as you can." She paused, smiling. "...Trust me."


Ellesandra 

On the way, Ellesandra was too distracted with her emotions and keeping an eye out for any trouble to notice how Star was looking at her. On top of that, she had used the time spent getting to their location to help filter out her anger. It was still there when they stopped, but deep conscientious breathing had helped to reduce the intensity of it. When Star began summoning some sort of blue light, then a rainbow around her arm brought curiosity to the front. Was Star displaying some form of her ability to Ellesandra, as explanation for the plan? However, when she was asked to strike Star as hard as she can, she snorted. She didn't respond verbally, but she also had no plan to actually strike Star as hard as she could. She'd known this mage for what, three hours at this point, maybe less? She didn't trust Star yet; trust was not something Ellesandra gave easily. Reaching out, Ellesandra did strike Star's arm with an open palm, about as hard as a sibling might punch one another in a friendly jesting way. Not intended to really damage, but if whatever she was doing didn't block any of the impact it would be sore. That would be enough for her to identify what exactly was happening and how sturdy Star's magic might be. She did have to make an active effort not to draw Star's magic into herself when making contact with it, however. If this was supposed to be a test to how Star would hold up against the pirates, it would not do to use her own unique abilities on it.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star remained still as Ellesandra struck her arm. Or rather, attempted to. Ellesandra instead struck something that felt solid as adamantine. Star's arm did not move in the slightest. If either of them would be sore, it would be the knight, but as much was unlikely given their less than enthusiastic strike. Star just smiled. "If that's as hard as you can hit, I will have to wonder who it was aided me against the pirates a few short hours ago," she said with a giggle. "...Your blade, much less those of the pirates, cannot harm me if I have time, mana, and focus enough to employ this strength of my gift. I encourage you to truly strike my arm, so you can hold confidence in more than my words that I will be safe." She kept her smile. "...I do keep asking you to trust me, but...I understand that that doubts I see in you will remain. I hope only that I can prove in time that I have aimed to be trustworthy at every step. You did save me, after all. I'd not wish to return to that initial scenario in which you found to me to test fate and see if my magic would have guided me from harm. I owe you at least my honesty for that."


Ellesandra 

She shouldn't have been surprised. She'd made the attack expecting magic to have somehow strengthened Star's arm, but it being as completely solid as it felt still made her raise an eyebrow. "To be fair, Miss Lumina." She said, frowning at the comment about the pirates. "I hardly struck the pirates with any strength. Three quick stabs was all that was needed, none of which required strength behind them." It was true; between them having been blinded and her own haste spell, which in hindsight wasn't necessary but Ellesandra hadn't known how inexperienced the pirates were at first, it had been simple to get past their guard and simply shove a sharp blade into fleshy skin. When invited to truly strike Lumina's arm though, she had shaken her head in refusal. "If I were to not hold back, Miss Lumina, I would absorb the magic effecting your arm, and strike through it. Or enchant my rapier to strike through." Why was she saying this? Because it got her away from the topic of Star risking herself for this woman. Not that Ellesandra thought the woman's life wasn't worth risking for, but STAR being the one to risk it wasn't what she wanted. "So, what is your plan then? To coat yourself in magic and simply walk in there, take her, and walk out?"


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star gave a difficult smile at Ellesandra's words. On one hand, knowing they hardly even had to try made her feel a bit better that they hadn't been in danger. On the other, it made her wish the pirates would have seen sense all the more. Either way, she undid the magic on her arm, letting it disperse, then moved to the pond to cup some water her in her hand that she used to wipe the blood of her face, finally, before turning to her companion again. "I somehow doubt that is true, but I won't tempt fate by trying it if that is how it is," she said, clearly confident in her own abilities, but also wise enough to not let her desire to reassure Ellesandra take things to an extreme that might see her hurt. Apparently Star was capable of assessing risk after all. "Well, a little more than that. That part is just to ensure they can't hurt me. But if everything does go to plan, then I won't have to worry about anyone taking a swing at me in the first place." She realized she would need to justify those statements more, something she couldn't do in the meeting. She drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. "My magic is something called Auramancy. There have been some other magics by similar or identical names I've found in my travels, which I'm sure you can understand is frustrating. But mine, specifically, is concerned with the manipulation of auras, insofar as that applies to the energies that surround and permeate all living things. It's...Very difficult to make it all make sense in words. But with a little subtlety on my side, the hope is to sneak onto the ship with some discretion and use my powers to influence anyone on board into passivity. It's not very easy to do that if someone is already hostile, but...I am confident I can take a subtle approach that can avoid suspicion long enough to get to where Morrun's wife is being held. I know an arcane spell called Knock that will allow me to get her out of her cell, and once I have her, another spell called Dimension Door will carry us from the ship to the edge of the forest in an instant. That's why I was hoping you could be here, to ensure the landing space was safe. To ensure that we could have an expeditious getaway if there was an alarm. To...Deal with any pirates who swiftly ascended to challenge Morrun." Again, she seemed to have difficulty talking about the notion of killing, necessary as it might be. "A frontal assault is suicide, I know. But I can maintain my chromatic aura long enough to keep me safe if things go south, long enough to get me to his wife and out. It...does mean I imagine that sleeping at the inn no longer being an option is a foregone conclusion. But I am fine to sleep among the trees if it means saving an innocent woman. And I will know where she is held simply because I will be able to...See her distress." Well, that certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense at face value, now would it?


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra frowned deeply at the explanation being provided. Even should Star be able to influence others that way, it was dangerous. And on that topic, was Star influencing her? Was that why her emotions were so reactive around Star? No, no Star had no idea about how her appearance and mannerisms effected her. Or how the Princess and Knight comment had effected her. At least, not WHY it had effected her. Ellesandra crossed her arms, eyeing Star for a moment. "That would explain your apparent empathy, I guess." If she could sense someone's aura, she could probably tell if someone was lying, couldn't she? It would probably make it particularly easy for her to be insightful, too. No wonder she'd been able to read Morrun like a book. Was that why she had kept looking at Ellesandra before? With a short nod, Ellesandra took a deep breath and let out a sigh. "Okay, I'll go meet up with Morrun and tell him we are going to get his gold, but want him to come meet us rather than carrying it into the city. I'm sure we'll have one or two people follow but the pirates probably won't assume he's ditching his wife. If any follow I'll take care of them." She glanced around at the woods, planning out where would be a good place to wait in trap, but continued talking while she did so. "Now, what is the plan if for some reason you can't get out? They have an anti-magic field or something?" She had to ask. Things happened, and she really didn't want to have to storm a ship to save Star due to lack of planning.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star gave a soft smile. "I have been described as an empath before, yes. It's not a simple as just being able to know intrinsically if someone is lying to me, or if someone is holding out, or...Well, anything really. An aura is a complex thing. It's taken me a lifetime to be able to make as much sense of it as I can. My mother was leagues beyond my current capabilities, and is undoubtedly ever more so...If she still lives." Another sad smile. "As for the pirate ship, well...I would be able to tell rather swiftly if it was made of sussar bark, or if anti-magic was being used." A nuance to her power that Ellesandra might not yet understand, she surmised, so chose this moment to explain. She did say she owed them her honestly, after all. "You see I...The typical medium for my magic is sight. I see auras. I see emotion. Sometimes, that emotion carries memories. Sometimes, flickers of emotion linger like clouds that I can follow. Intense moments of the heart make the auras of those who experience them spike, and can leave remnants. I looked upon all the ships in port when we entered. I could see the auras of all the individuals on each of the ships, and lingering clouds on those which were abandoned. I would be able to feel the void of anti-magic if it was upon the ship as I approached and give me time and warning to leave earlier than expected. I will say I...don't expect them to have such things, but I admire your forward thinking." Another smile. "It...Means a lot to me that you are willing to support me in this. I already am the one who owes you, and yet you selflessly offer your aide yet again. I...Do not know how I will begin to repay you, but...Should you think of anything, I pledge to do all I can for all you've done and continue to do for me. Thank you."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She SAW emotions? Was that why she kept looking at Ellesandra oddly? She hadn't been sure why, chocking it up to gratefulness, curiosity, or maybe even attraction, but seeing her emotions? Ellesandra was a very guarded individual with her emotions, she shared them with no one. The fact that Star could just slip past that guard and see them disturbed her. Not only that, but she thought about the strength of the emotions she'd been feeling in the past couple of hours. How Star reminded her of her Princess, and how that had thrown all of her guarded emotions everywhere. Typically she'd go weeks without letting herself feel them, but it seemed every other conversation with Star they were coming up based on the similarities. Had Star seen the memories associated with those emotions? Distrust sprung up in her and her jaw clenched, physically taking a step back from Star and clenching her fists. Ellesandra looked coiled, ready to spring into a fight or to escape at a moment's notice. She took every emotion she could currently feel and bundled it up, locking it in a box firmly and securely. She reined in every ounce of control she had to repress everything she was feeling, at least everything related to her past. She didn't answer the thanks at all, seemingly turning entirely business-focused. Reaching back into her pack, she slung it forward enough to pull out a hair tie and began pulling her hair up into a warrior's ponytail - how she typically wore it if she expected any chance at combat. "I'll ensure Morrun gets here." Her words were clipped, edging on harsh. There was anger in her tone, but it was being tightly controlled. "Should anything go wrong and you can't get here, make some sort of sign in the sky. I'll look out for it."

Star Lumina
Star was an insightful enough woman to know that what she was admitting might provoke a poor reaction. She wanted to be open an honest, but she knew honesty came with its pitfalls. It was curious that what flicked the switch was her being able to see them, rather than sense them. That was the admission that saw Ellesandra retreat into themselves, at least; Star had long gone beyond finding such things coincidental in her travels. People could wear masks. People could fight their emotions. But even Ellesandra's attempts to embrace the utmost stoicism would prove futile. Emotions were wild and untamed. Uncontrollable at their core. One could resist them. One needn't be ruled by them. But they still clung to the aura. Focusing one's mind on a task had some effect, but Ellesandra's guilt was so overbearing that force of will could not repress it. Not that it changed anything. Star had been seeing it for hours now. She similarly could see the anger, the distrust. That it wounded Star was obvious. Her bright, open, honest self being rejected by this woman who saved her did hurt, and the way her eyes grew heavy and drift to the ground between them made it clear. Ellesandra might fight to keep themselves stoic, but...Star was as easy and plain to read as ever. She said nothing in response. She simply nodded twice to the order, then silently walked past Ellesandra and began back towards the city, leaving the knight to take care of Morrun.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra felt the distance grow between them. Saw the disappointment in Star's eyes and how she'd looked down to the ground. The hurt at Ellesandra's distrust and anger was evident. Why the fuck did she feel guilty over that? She reminded herself that Star had invaded her privacy, it was like reading a mind. Sure maybe Star didn't exactly have an option; Ellesandra didn't know if she could turn the sight off. But it still felt like she'd been betrayed, somehow. That Star had seen past things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone; that her defenses had failed her. Hell, it her defenses were probably all but useless in front of Star's magic. She needed to finish this job - even if she wasn't getting paid, it was a job - and then get away from Star. It was dangerous having someone who could see her emotions like that, emotions Ellesandra hadn't let herself process and had no desire to talk about. There was a moment where Ellesandra watched Star walk off, eyes scanning either side of the road to ensure that there wasn't any danger down Star's path. She waited until she could no longer see Star, to ensure she'd made it that far safely at least, before heading back towards the town herself. She made for a direct path with the tavern again, her real anger being used to glare down anyone who so much as looked her way with interest. Passing those who had catcalled them before, she gave them an icy stare that all but challenged them to try something or say something again. She wanted an outlet for her anger, even if she knew that was stupid, unnecessary, and wouldn't help. She wasn't some reckless boy who got angry and stormed through the town making it everyone else's problem. She was a disciplined, well trained knight and bodyguard. It didn't mean that temptation wasn't there, though. When she made it to the tavern, she did a quick sweep of the patrons again, making note of those who had obviously been part of the pirate group before and where they were located, and then searching for Morrun. Hopefully he hadn't gotten himself in trouble while they'd walked out to make plans.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The two had not been gone long at all. That, in itself, had a few raised eyebrows. Some...Expectant ones. From the catcallers to the tavern-dwellers, they weren't quite smart enough to pick up that something was wrong, but they sure did find it a tiny bit odd. Odd enough to think on it for a few seconds, then return to their steins of ale. It was surely someone else's problem to sort out. Morrun, meanwhile, had collected his things and looked like there was a spring sitting under his seat. The company this tavern provided gave him no delights, and he was eager to be rid of them. Star, meanwhile, moved through the city towards the docks. No signs of distress or alarm could be heard on the air, so, so far everything was going to plan. Morrun looked at Ellesandra with hope, eagerly awaiting instruction.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra glanced once more at the pirates around the tavern, to ensure they weren't about to get up and make any moves or anything foolish. Once she was confident that they were staying out of the way, at least for now, she looked back to Morrun, who seemed over excited. "Come. I'm not foolish enough to carry that type of money into what could have been an elaborate ploy to rob us. You'll meet us and provide the service we are paying exorbitant fees for, and then you can take that money back for this ransom." She dropped her voice, still loud enough for most in the tavern to hear but playing it off as if she were grumbling to herself and it wasn't intended for others to hear. "My Lady apparently has deeper pockets than she does sense." Ellesandra was trying to play up that she knew this was a stupid thing to pay for, and more money than appropriate. That would be suspicious to the pirates, certainly. But if she were playing it as if her employer was simply a bleeding heart rich noble who didn't care about the cost. It would potentially place a target on Star's back later, but if things went according to plan Star wouldn't be here long enough for that to matter. She stepped to the side and motioned Morrun towards the door, not letting him follow behind or anything. "I'll lead you up to where we're camped currently. You'll get to see the gold, but you are not to touch it until you've provided her the service. Understood?"


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

"Y-Yes, understood, understood!" said Morrun, eagerly jumping up. The pirates had a few laughs at his expense, which he scowled at, but rose above and moved forward to walk towards the entrance. One of the pirates then also stood. One wearing a long black coat. Scimitar was in its sheath, but the handle clearly visible. The man bore a scar over one green eye and had a red bandana over his hair, and was clean shaven unlike most of the others. "I think I'll join you," the man brazenly said. "See about where you're camped. Can't risk our ah...Legitimate business transaction going and walking away from us now can we?" Suspicion hadn't been breached yet, but this man, of seemingly higher rank, but discernibly not the captain of this crew, saw fit to throw his weight around a little. They had clearly operated with impunity thus far, and the brazen confidence that made the other pirates sloppy fighters similarly was making this man - presumably a first mate - feel bold enough to invite himself along for the walk. "Come on lads, two of ya get off your plump asses and take a walk, could use it to sober up a little and get back to work when we get back, eh? Captain's gonna want to haul ass outta 'ere once we have ourselves a little spending spree at the conclusion of this transaction." At his remarks, two of the other pirates rose off their stools, cursing under their breath and just slightly unsteady in their gait, to join the first mate. The first mate then motioned to the door for Ellesandra, wearing the most smug grin he possibly could.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra looked back towards the pirate, obviously someone of more influence than the base crew, and a frown creased her face. Her eyes narrowed and she looked the man up and down. "You expect me to let you come near my Lady, armed, while she has gold prepared for a transaction? Criminals of your level do not respect honor, so don't give me your word or anything." Her left hand moved over to rest on the hilt of her rapier on her hip. It was a subtle threat, but not one that she was actively making. "If you must come, you will wait back from the camp. You may be within eyesight, but I will not tolerate you approaching." Ellesandra was calling upon every bit of her knightly confidence and authority. She wasn't tall by any means; likely most of those in the tavern would stand much taller than her 5'1 height. However, she had the presence of someone much bigger than she actually was, a confidence of a trained soldier and one that would not be afraid to fight her way out of something. She was drawing what would be considered a normally appropriate boundary for the safety of her Lady, without outright refusing the Pirate. Hopefully, the pirate wouldn't let his confidence push past that.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The pirate placed his hands on his hips and smirked. "Or wha? You gonna prick me with your needle, pipsqueak? Oughta be a wench servin' up ale in 'ere rather than tryin' t' lay down the law," he said, then nudged his pirate mate with his elbow. "Ey, get a load o' 'iss lass, tryna' tell us how it is, eyy?" he said, sharing a chuckle with his mates as they collectively bathed in their misogyny they found so hilarious. "Pff, whatever you say, 'muh lady'," he said in as mocking a tone as he could. "We won't trample on your pretty posies, just make quick of it, yeah? Any funny business and I'm sure the captain won't have any qualms tripling the er, ah...Protection fee we're charging." His arms crossed over his chest here, sporting a smug stance as he towered over the shorter knight by an entire foot. He wasn't nice about it, but it seemed Ellesandra's demands were being heeded. A need to enforce his pride and power in front of his mates balanced by...Perhaps a desire to not upset the captain by screwing things up, and thus, the concession was given. "Lead on, proud knight, to your little fairy garden with all its shiny little coins, yeah?"


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra ignored the misogyny. All that mattered to her was that he'd agreed to it. The threat about tripling the protection fee was ignored, since they weren't actually going to be paying it anyways. Ellesandra considered encouraging him to go first, rather than turning her back to him and walking through. She didn't want to, but she didn't think he'd go along with that if she demanded it. "As you wish. Unfortunately, my Lady has gold, but not the necessary remove curse spells to fix whatever is going on with your face, if that's what you're hoping to find." With a smirk, she stood to the side as she opened the door, then closed it behind her as she stepped through. He might stop the door from closing, but by then she'd have stepped out, to the side and where she could keep an eye on him while walking forward. There was no attempt to stop him, or the others he'd brought with him, from following. Instead, she motioned for Morrun to continue forward and eyeing the pirates and, as long as they didn't start a fight, would begin leading them out towards the forest where she'd chatted with Star.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The man didn't find the joke funny. It was risky. Getting the jab in nearly had the man luging in response. One of his mates was stepping forward, only to have the first mate plant his hand on the lesser pirate's chest. "Easy lad. We get the money first, then we can show the lil' pipsqueak here what a cursed face looks like. See how inspiring she is in that armor with that ugly mug cut to ribbons, yeah?" he said, quietly to his mate, but loud enough to ensure Ellesandra heard him. Assuming that didn't set the knight off in turn, the men followed. When exiting, Ellesandra would be able to see Star - her dress didn't exactly make her subtle - as she was boarding the ship. Seemed she got past anyone on the docks without a hitch. Some pirates approached Star when she boarded. It was too far to hear anything or make out details, but whatever it was that was said seemed good enough for the deck hands who let her pass. She then disappeared to the bowels of the ship while one of the deck hands made their way to what could be presumed to be the captain's quarters. The first mate and his merry band of drunkards were right behind Ellesandra and Morrun, who at this point looked stressed enough to have a heart attack right in front of the knight. His pack was on his back, and he walked with rigidity to his gait. The group would be able to make it to wherever Ellesandra led them, however there would be some expectation of results once the group arrived from the three pirates.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra didn't respond to the threat. She shouldn't have made the jab, in all honesty, but there was something about how he'd insulted Star that was still bothering her. When Ellesandra noticed Star getting aboard the pirate ship, she made sure not to watch the ship directly. No, she kept an eye out of her peripheral vision to ensure Star got on without difficulty, but otherwise pointed up towards where they were going to ensure the pirate's attention was on her and their destination, no straying eyes back to potentially see what Star was doing. "We've made camp just over the ridge up there, into the forest. That's our destination." She made her way, not looking at the pirates at all other than keeping them within sight to ensure they didn't try to backstab her or anything. When the crested the ridge and looked into the woods, Ellesandra touched Morrun's arm and motioned to a copse of trees. "We're camped just past those trees. Why don't you go speak with her and start whatever magical detection you're doing while I have a chat with our friends here?" She wanted to ensure morrun was at least a few steps away before any fighting began. She had also been sure to place herself between Morrun and the men when she said this. If they tried to reach for him, they'd have to reach past her first - which even if they thought she was a weak woman would be stupid to do. Her gaze cut to the pirates with a firm look. "As I said before, i don't trust them near my Lady."


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The pirates seemed more or less indifferent to the goings-on, eager only to get their payday, and not do anything that would mess it up. So, despite some mocking smirks from the first mate, he was content to stuff his hands in his pockets and whistle to himself, rising up to his tip toes and falling back down again. Morrun of course heeded Ellesandra's words and moved away into the forest. Obviously, not finding Star, he understood what was happening and made sure to stay out of sight somewhere nearby. He was ready to start chanting magical nonsense to fool the pirates if needed, but he hoped to simply remain out of sight. Then it was just...A waiting game. The pirates were passive, but expectant. They wouldn't wait forever. And they certainly would know something was up the moment Star showed up, since Star was apparently over with Morrun doing weird magic stuff while Ellesandra stood guard. Star was certainly hard at work...And no signal in the sky just yet. So it was Ellesandra's moment to either bide their time, or make a move.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had no intention of waiting for Star. She wanted these pirates dealt with both in case Star did signal that Ellesandra was needed, and before Star returned so that she wouldn't be in danger during the fight. Ellesandra waited, back to the brushes and facing the pirates passively for a few moments, giving Morrun plenty of time to head in and find somewhere to hide, away from danger. She gave herself to a silent count of thirty before she withdrew her rapier. "You have the option of returning to town now and keeping your lives, or fighting and dying. Your choice." She was sure her drawing her rapier had put them on edge, but she hadn't attacked; not at first. She held the rapier in front of her, right foot going back and sinking down into a proper fighting stance. She didn't use magic, based on how unskilled the previous pirates had been. The two drunk ones she wasn't worried about at all; the more authoritative one might possess some skill, but she wasn't dropping her guard. She could always add magic if needed later.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The moment Ellesandra reached for her rapier, the first mate drew his sword. He had clearly been just as ready for a fight, though that message didn't make it to his two lightly inebriated comrades. They had a few seconds before they joined in the fight as well. The two circled around either of Ellesandra's flanks, leaving them surrounded. A familiar fighting position. "...Way I sees it, there's three of us and one of you," began the first mate. "So I thank 'ye, for giving me the chance I was itchin' for to pay you back for all that holier-than-thou bullshit you carried in on your boots the moment you set foot in our turf," he said, venom dripping from his words. Not that it was any surprise, but they weren't going to pull punches now that they had been given reason to fight. And if Ellesandra hadn't already started the fight, the three of them rushed in all at once, coordinating their attack to all strike from different angles at, more or less, the same time, aiming to chop at any part of Ellesandra not covered by armor.


Ellesandra 

"I guess I'll do to you what I did to your friends out on the road, then." She had timed the comment specifically to potentially throw them off when they planned to attack, but whether or not it worked she didn't wait to see. As they all began to attack, she quickly pivoted towards one of the drunkards the movement itself dodged two blades, and her own moved up to knock the other away. She went for the same killing blow she'd had on the others, a slice into the throat and pull out. Ellesandras movements were fluid, not stopping whether or not she'd hit. She'd used the movement to create distance between herself and the others, ducking from where she'd been surrounded into where she could face them all, and quickly stepping into the other drunkard with an attempt to do the same to him. They were the easy targets, and she could use fancy footwork to avoid the only sober one of them until his two companions were taken care of. That was her plan, anyways.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The footwork of the knight was far and above the three pirates. The two lackeys had no chance. Their swings were filled with arrogance and confidence, even in the wake of the comment about Ellesandra felling two others. The first ate Ellesandra's rapier in the neck, paralyzed by the attack as he was left to bleed out once the rapier was withdrawn. The distance was too short, however, for the action to keep Ellesandra out of harm's way. The other lackey's sword went wide, but the first mate had clearly seen his share of sorties. Enough that the strike to his underling presented him an opportunity to swing horizontal across Ellesandra's thighs. The metal bit into flesh. Shallow wounds, not enough to impede Ellesandra, but torn fabric and the first droplets of crimson from the knight at the hands of these criminals was spilled. His follow up was to backhand his own other, living lackey, which saved the man's neck from the thrust of the rapier by inches as he reeled back just before Ellesandra could thrust. He might be a criminal, but he clearly had some sense, even if it came with callousness towards his men. He didn't seem fazed that the other died. With the initial engagement sorted, Ellesandra then found the remaining two pirates staring her down. Hesitation, and fear rose in the first mate, as if surprised the knight was...Exactly who they claimed to be. But rather than charge in head on again, the first mate produced a glass bottle of some sort filled with crackling energy and swiftly hurled it at Ellesandra's feet. The bottle shattered on impact, exploding into a cloud of thick smoke that obscured the battlefield. The smoke stung at Ellesandra's eyes and throat, but a knight like her would find the crude trick was not up to the staunch fortitude she possessed. Some coughing and watering eyes aside, it wouldn't be able to daze her as the pirates expected it might; however, it did still obscure vision, and thus needed reliance on sound. The charges were staggered; the lackey first, with the first mate a few steps behind. Given his previous attack, it seemed he might be counting on Ellesandra to attack the first available target, then use the chance to run them through, which is precisely what they would attempt to do if Ellesandra played their game. Of course, the obscuring smoke went both ways. So there was no guarantee Ellesandra was even where they expected her to be in the seconds between the smoke engulfing the battlefield and the charge starting.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra had let out a silent curse at feeling the blade slice at her thighs. Perhaps she should have gone ahead and used magic to ensure easy victory. Still, they didn't really enjoy the idea of the lethargy that hit them after using their haste spell, and their other magic was more focused against magic users. Ellesandra was frowning as she faced the remaining two pirates, a little impressed with the first mate slapping his companion out of the way of her strike. Well, that just meant she wouldn't be able to go for the quick, easy death for them then. As the man slammed the bottle onto the ground and smoke pillowed out, Ellesandra quickly backpeddled. No use standing in smoke that was stinging at her eyes and throat, though she did her best to remain silent while doing so and to take careful steps back so she didn't fall backwards. As such, she was not where they believed her to be when attacking. In fact, she had begun circling around, looking for movement as she did so, making her way around where the smoke was billowing. It would start spreading out soon, allowing visibility again, but when it did Ellesandra was standing on the other side of where she had been before. Her free hand was up, partially covering her mouth and nose to filter any of the smoke a little more, and as soon as she could see one of them well enough to strike, she did. The goal was to strike before they got their whereabouts back, whichever one she struck, and this time she was aiming straight at the person's chest.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

There was a calm that fell over the battlefield as Ellesandra retreated and circled the smoke plume. Their attempts to be stealthy were hampered by the heavy armor they wore; the clacking of the metal even when moving slowly made enough noise against the dead quiet of the forest to keep a vague location in mind. From within the smoke, there was nothing at first. Then... "Wh-- Hey! What are you doing ya maddie-- WHOAAAA!" From within the smoke cloud, the lower ranking pirate sailed through the air at Ellesandra, having been thrown at her with quite an impressive toss that had the lackey sailing like a cannonball at the knight. As unconventional as strategies came, and an absolute epitome of pirate tactics. No honour among thieves, and no care for each other's lives either it seemed. But the opening provided was slim, so whether Ellesandra took the bait and killed the man in flight, only to be braced or toppled by the impact, or rolled out of the way, the first mate was right behind, ready to stab clear through his ally to get at the knight, or take advantage of her lowered guard to thrust at whatever space he could see that wasn't armored.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra hadn't forgotten the noise she made, but when there was movement and confusion in the smoke, she had been hoping the noise wasn't easy to follow. Still, she had NOT expected one of the pirates to be THROWN at her. She did not take the easy stab it provided, instead dodging to the side, which allowed her to see the first mate coming in behind his companion who had been thrown at her. She stepped up towards him while his companion sailed past to her right, feinting a stab towards his neck like he would expect her to take. She kept her guard up, planning to either reach forward and grab him if he tried to move out of the way, or to quickly stab lower if he moved his blade up to block it.

Star Lumina
Indeed, the lackey sailed past, rolling around as he hit the ground. The first mate reacted, seeing the knight rolled out of the way. Arrogance once more proved to be the man's downfall, however, as he expected to still have the upper hand. By the time Ellesandra had readied their attack, the first mate had already jumped into the air and was ready to descend upon her with a stab at her neck. But in the contest of knight vs first mate, his attack would prove the more easily dodged. A swift adjustment to the side is all Ellesandra would need to do to avoid his thrust, and all she had to do otherwise was hold her rapier out for the man to skewer himself upon.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra looked up upon the first mate swinging towards her. His attack was extremely choreographed, easily read. She slid beneath his attack, right hand out to catch him and rapier tilted up so that as he fell, he would fall upon her blade. She caught him as he skewered himself, hand gripping onto his chest and shoving him backwards just as soon as he landed upon her sword to avoid him trying to go for any suicidal attacks either. Ellesandra stayed mobile, quickly hopping backwards after shoving him off of her blade, and glancing between him and the pirate he had thrown for any signs of movement or hostility remaining. The sting of the cuts on her thighs increased a little at this movement, but in the adrenaline of a fight it was at the very back of her mind.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Ellesandra would find the other pirate had worked his way up to his feet, stumbling. The first mate wheezed and coughed up blood as one lung filled with blood where he had been punctured. He would die in the next minute or so. The other pirate, realizing he had been all but sacrificed by his crew, and seeing two of said crew laying dead on the floor, saw no reason to swear fealty to this band of pirates any longer. He kept his weapon on him, but as Ellesandra was throwing the first mate to the ground, he was hurriedly running away into the forest, away from Cloverport, through the trees to the west. She could run after him, and likely catch him with ease. But there was no immediate threat to the plan as he ran. All his allies were back to the south, and if he intended on circling around, it would likely be too little, too late. It was about this time, as well, that a surge of mana appeared in the form of a bright blue archway that opened with crackling energy. Through it, Star and an elven woman shot forward, with a flash of light streaking from the port city to the magical doorway that saw the two of them briefly encased in bright white light before they landed, sure on their feet. Star was fully surrounded by that brilliant, rainbow energy. The sort she said would only be needed if she was in danger, as it would stop any blades from hurting her. So it seemed, not everything went perfectly to plan, and there was cause enough to defend herself. She was, thankfully, in one piece. But she also looked out of breath; doubtlessly, she was pushing herself to the limits of her mana. The radiant, rainbow energy dissipated off her, returning her to her natural state, and she then doubled over, braced on her knees, to catch her breath.


Ellesandra 

She watched as the other pirate ran off. She only watched for a few moments, keeping an eye on the direction he was going as well as if he was making any motion to come back and surprise her. Meanwhile she turned her gaze down to the first mate, reaching forward and pushing her rapier through his throat to make his death quicker and easier. No need to have him sputtering on the ground from gut wound; those were never fun. When the magical portal appeared Ellesandra's head snapped up, going into another fighting stance with a brief wince at the cut the pirate had gotten on the back of her thighs. It was apparent that the people coming through it were not pirates though, and after watching to ensure they hadn't been followed or anything, she straightened and leaned down, cleaning the blood off her blade with the pirates shirt. "Your Husband is back in the woods there." She pointed in the direction for the woman that Ellesandra assumed was his wife, sheathing her sword while straightening and looking back to the ladies. There was concern that shot up when seeing Star doubled over breathing heavily, but she didn't approach. There was also a little bit of shame at having let one of the pirates wound her, even if it had been a minor wound, and distrust was still apparent in regards to Star's ability to simply see past her emotional guards. Ellesandra reached for her pack, pulling out the necessary bandages and clothes to begin treating her own wounds. "Were either of you hurt?"


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The elven woman was wearing a matching wedding band to her husband, along with an emerald engagement ring to pair with it. She had similar complexion to him and soft black hair that made her bright green eyes stand out against her freckled face. "T-Thank you! Thank you!" she said, on the edge of tears. Red markings adorned the elven woman's wrists in the shape of manacles, and similar red marks from what was likely rope or cloth were on her cheeks in line with her mouth. That she attempted to break free from her captivity was as obvious as the mistreatment she endured. The woman ran in the direction noted, and the two could be heard speaking after a few moments as they came together, inaudible from the distance. Star looked at Ellesandra with concern upon noticing their wounds. Her arms were trembling as she strained to keep herself stable, with sweat visible on her brow. Quite a bit of strain she endured, it seemed. "N-No, the...Captain...Came after me. Definitely tried to kill me, but I was ready for it," she said, offering as reassuring a smile as she could given her fatigue. "I can only assume he will be riling up the pirates left in the city, so we should be...Anywhere that isn't here right now. I'm sorry." She willed herself up to her feet and began to walk, still clearly short of breath. If Star's intuition was correct, the group would have a limited time frame to escape before the wide search party began to track them down. Long enough that they needn't set off sprinting...But not long enough for anyone to truly relax and prepare for the road ahead.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra didn't respond to the elven woman, letting her go off and reconnect with her husband for a moment. She took that moment to pull out a small flask of alcohol and pour on the cuts she gained, clenching her teeth at the burning feeling, and then quickly beginning to wrap them up and bandage them. They weren't deep or bad enough to need more than that, a simple disinfect and wrap up to help them clot and stop bleeding. When she was done, she straightened up entirely again from the awkward position she'd been leaning to reach her own thighs, looking Star up and down to confirm she was telling the truth in regards to being fine. Nodding to confirm she at least didn't seem injured, just fatigued, Ellesandra walked up and offered her arm, in case Star was so fatigued she needed the support. "You're right. Plus, one of the pirates who followed us here ran off. I don't know that he'll go back and tell his men, but there's a possibility, which means we'll have less time than we thought. Should get your contact and his wife ready to go." Ellesandra wasn't unused to needing to move quickly, especially after a skirmish. She did glance behind her briefly at the town to see if anyone had seen them or were moving directly towards them, but beyond keeping an eye out she was just focused on getting them moving away. Pirates likely didn't have much experience tracking over land, at least she hoped they didn't, and she had plenty of experience disguising tracks. She just needed to get further away from the city to make it worth it.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star looked at Ellesandra's arm. There was an unexpected moment of...Decision in that. As if there was more to grabbing the offered arm than precisely just that. A flash of pain, or perhaps guilt, came over Star's face. She gave the most polite declining gesture she could, offering a smile along with the raised palm to try and assure them that she was okay. She was unsteady as she began moving to do as asked, so it might seem a peculiar decision to decline the help. Regardless, she moved to the husband and wife. "I'm sorry, both of you, but we had best be clear of this place. We should be going now, and we can talk when we're safe." Her words were not alarmist, just stating the matter at hand. The two nodded. "R-Right," began Morrun. "The elvish settlement I'm from isn't terribly far. A day's walk north-west along the main roads, we could arrive by midnight if we take the forest path," he explained, looking to Star and Ellesandra for a decision on the matter. It seemed simple, but Star still looked at Ellesandra. Obviously the knight couldn't stay here, and finding their way to a new place with a warm bed and armed guards to deter any pirates would be safest. But she also couldn't rule out the fact that Ellesandra might be feeling pushed at this point. First it was saving Star, then just to the city, then roped into helping these two...Star didn't hold judgement in her eyes, and could hardly blame them if they wanted to take this chance to walk their own path.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra frowned when Star refused her help, but then proceeded to walk unsteadily towards the couple. She considered reaching out and taking her arm forcefully to help, but held back from doing so. Star was a grown ass woman and if she decided she didn't want help, Ellesandra was not going to push it on her. She followed behind, glancing towards the Morrun when he confirmed there was an elvish settlement not far from here. The look from Star was ignored; while Ellesandra technically had a choice, she really didn't. She wasn't going to leave these three to go find their own way. "Do the pirates know about this settlement? If they do, they may be expecting you to go that way and already be looking or tracking in that area. We may want to take a roundabout path to avoid such, but if you don't think they know, straight path there is likely the quickest and safest. I can follow a bit behind and throw the trail off." She'd learned in her training how to create false tracks and hide real ones. It was important, knowing how to throw a pursuer or kidnapper off the trail. She'd be a bit behind them so they were more exposed if they did get attacked while she was doing it, but if they waited until they were a safe enough distance away from the town they could cut down on the risk of that happening pretty substantially.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

"It's not on any maps, and it is guiled in illusory magic. I doubt they know. It's not...Impossible, but I'd never assume a meat-headed pirate would be capable of finding such a place. But even if they did, the hunters of Lea'taas would see arrows in their eyes long before they reached the walls. It will be safe there, I promise," he said, a look of genuine appreciation on his face. There were few in the world who would be so kind as to do what Star and Ellesandra did, fewer still who would do so after discovering that Morrun's initial intent was to deceive the pair of them into paying an extortionary amount of money for information that was nowhere near worth the amount asked. The gratitude of he and his wife was clear. There was no trace of dishonesty to be found. Star, as well, in all her insight and power, did not signal that she saw anything but honesty in the man. "Besides. We are ahead of them now, and can remain so if we leave immediately. They were all in Cloverport. I heard talk of them sailing out within the week for another city further down the coast. They won't be roaming these wilds; there's nothing of value to thieves like them to be found for miles." Aside from the elven settlement, of course, but as established it was extremely unlikely the pirates even knew that existed unless told about it. With all said, Star nodded to Ellesandra's words. "I'll take the lead with Morrun, then, in case danger comes from the front," said Star, still winded, and taking much longer than one might expect to catch her breath. "I-I...I'll alert you of any danger while y-you...You cover our tracks. But we should...Should move." Still breathing heavily, Star gestured for Morrun to take the lead, following him with his wife keeping close behind the two. Star watched over her shoulder at Ellesandra. Partly just to ensure they were coming, but also just...More of that curious gaze of hers, this time paired with a somewhat worried look in her eyes.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra nodded to what Morrun said. That was enough to convince her heading straight there was the right move. When Star suggested she'd take the lead in case they were attacked from the front, however, Ellesandra frowned. Their gaze raked over Star once again, searching for a wound. Was she simply that winded from keeping her magical armor up and then doing the portal? That would be understandable, especially considering the light magic she'd done just earlier, but that also meant she was probably on her last leg stamina wise. Fighting anyone who came from the front wouldn't be ideal for her. The concern was evident, even without Star being able to see the emotion itself. The concern was directly tethered to the guilt and sorrow, a fear creeping out that the past would be repeated. Ellesandra almost said something, to stop them while she covered tracks, but she held back. She was being ridiculous. She followed behind them for a bit, not immediately parting ways to hide their tracks. The thing was, if the pirates found their initial tracks that would be good; plus they couldn't exactly hide the blood and bodies of the other pirates easily. And if the one who escaped said anything, trying to hide their tracks on that ridge was pointless. No, they needed to start off in their actual direction for a bit, and only after doing so would Ellesandra drop back silently and without comment to begin covering where their tracks actually went, and redirecting them to the road that they had originally come from and where Ellesandra had encountered Star and the pirates originally. She took a branch and swept the dirt and ground to cover where they had walked, then walked in another direction, making multiple sets of tracks using different weight in each step so unless someone really looked closely they wouldn't notice it was the same person.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Whether Ellesandra's methods would be useful at deterring any followers would remain unknown for the immediate future. The only way to know for sure that the deception succeeded was to never hear from the pirates again. A favourable outcome, but there would certainly be that lingering uncertainty that they might harbour a vendetta. It was equally likely they would get drunk, throw up, and forget this ever happened. Time would tell. For now, the forward march began. Star hadn't seemed injured when looking at her. There was blood on her dress, but that was the same blood as what was on her dress from before their rescue mission. The blood from her cheek. Just small dots on the otherwise pristine silks. The concern on Ellesandra's face made Star smile in response. To reassure, or genuinely because she felt happy to know Ellesandra was concerned for her? Difficult to say, but a smile she maintained. "Are you sure you can keep walking? Do you need to stop and rest?" asked Morrun to Star. She shook her head. "Nnh, I can press onward. We can rest when we're safe," came her reply. Despite this, Morrun still offered her his waterskin, which she did accept. Her arms shook slightly when drinking the water, but she clearly needed it from how much she drank from it. Time would pass. Hours of walking, interrupted by short rests now and then. Star did eventually catch her breath in this time, and there was little to do beyond walk the road and the forested path they eventually moved into with an eye for any dangers. Wild animals could be seen, but the prey animals ran and if there were any predator animals? They certainly stayed out of sight. It was a welcome reprieve from the dangers of Cloverport for Star, but despite the rests, despite the water, despite the time...She still had clear exhaustion in her gait. She kept up, but Ellesandra was certainly correct that she was in no shape to fight. She was barely in shape to walk.


Ellesandra 

The smile did little to reassure Ellesandra that Star was actually okay. She'd seen plenty of people smile through pushing themselves too hard. When Ellesandra rejoined them, her eyes once again scanned Star up and down to see how she was holding up before focusing on their surroundings to look out for a trap or sign anyone had caught up with them. The water was a good thing to be offered to Star, and she had nodded to Morrun in thanks when he had done so. As she stepped up to walk alongside the group, she looked over to the Elven woman, obviously injured. "Will these scouts from the elven encampment have any issue with Miss Lumina or my presence? And Miss-" This time, it was directed at Morrun's wife. "Do you have any injuries they gave you that need treated right now? It would be pointless to get there if you were hiding an infected whip cut or anything that's going to hurt more to wait." She was relatively confident that she'd bought them a little bit of time with her tracks, assuming they were even following them. That wasn't guaranteed, but it was a strong possibility depending on how upset the captain had been. Now, it was just a matter of if they unluckily stumbled across any on the road, like Star had previously.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

"A-Ah, I'm Lissana. Lissana Dayflower," said the elven woman, her voice meek but pleasant. "A-And, n-no, just..." she looked at her wrists. "The restraints. Maybe some bruising from when they threw me around," she said, gratitude in her eyes for Ellesandra's concern. "Some of the pirates were making...You know...C-Comments...A-About d-doing..." She cut herself off, one hand grabbing the other arm. A look of fear washed over her; blood drained from her face. "...I-It's good you showed up when you did, let's say," she said, clearly eager to conclude the matter. No tears were visible on her clothing from flogging or similar. Morrun naturally looked plenty disgusted upon hearing his wife recount such things, but he paused in his stride to let her move beside him so he could loop an arm around his beloved. "You're safe now," Morrun said to his wife, earning a nod. Then, another appreciative smile to Ellesandra. It was because of the knight and the mystic that he could say that with confidence, of course. Star didn't interject, but she looked over her shoulder at the exchange. First with sympathetic sorrow at Lissana, obviously holding nothing but dread at what might have been. But then a calm comfort, knowing they were okay. Battered, surely. Scared? Undoubtedly. But the worst was avoided. She could take comfort in having acted without hesitation and preventing tragedy. Though it seemed at this point she was pushing herself too hard; one leg gave out as she stepped, causing her to drop to one knee. She caught herself on her hands planting on the soft earth, then remained in this position for a moment, lightly trembling as she slowly, steadily tried to work back up to her feet.


Ellesandra 

Anger flashed through Ellesandra at Lissana's words. Her jaw clenched, but she forcibly relaxed it so that she didn't intimidate the elven woman. Rather than saying anything else, she let Morrun move in to comfort her. Best to come from her husband than some strange armored woman, anyways. She heard a shuffle up front and quickly looked back that way to see Star having fallen to one knee. Without a second of hesitation, Ellesandra jaunted forward quickly, ignoring the sting of pain coming from her own wound at the quick and sudden movement. In just a moment she'd found herself leaning over Star, reaching forward and placing a hand on Star's back to ensure she at least had support there. Her other hand was offered to Star to help her back up, a mixture of concern for Star's stamina and irritation at her pushing herself and refusing help coming up. It also pinged some of the grief, a reminder of someone else, but only Star would be able to see that with her ~Special Eyes~. "If you refuse help again, Miss Lumina, you only get one more chance. If you fall again, I will throw you over my shoulder and haul you the rest of the way back." The threat was made with absolute intention. It was a promise more than anything else, an acknowledgment that Star was setting a boundary about not wanting help and that Ellesandra would respect that for now, but if it happened again that boundary wouldn't matter.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The moment Ellesandra placed their hand on Star's back, the reason for her refusal to take Ellesandra's arm prior would come into much greater context. The physical touch evoked a connection. A spark of something that flowed up Ellesandra's arm. Like a wave of serene, beautiful water, it cascaded over Ellesandra's figure, bathing them in calm. In serenity. Inner peace. Of course, this came at odds with Ellesandra's own turmoil. It was not something that controlled or overrode Ellesandra's own emotion. It was simply...Comfort. Like a final exhale after hours-long frustration. Like finally being able to sit after marching for a week straight. It was...Soothing. And with that soothing feeling came an innate understanding. A recognition of the source. It was Star. Her aura touched Ellesandra when they touched her. It was not an unpleasant feeling. Quite the opposite in fact. But whether Ellesandra's hand lingered or removed swiftly would determine what followed. In the instant, at least, Star looked over her shoulder from her lowered position, up at Ellesandra, with worry in her eyes. Worry that she'd see the same closure, the same walls rising, the same...Distance from Ellesandra she saw before, as if Star was ashamed of her powers in the company of the knight.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra seemed to jump at the feeling of calm that poured through the touch. Her jaw clenched and she all but flinched away at first, finally understanding why Star had refused. There was another spike of irritation, but also...acceptance. Ellesandra wasn't going to let Star stumble the rest of the way. There was obvious displeasure, even just on her face, but she reached forward ant took Star's arm, ignoring the calm that came through the touch and working to pull Star into a standing position again. She maintained contact, her arm moving to wrap around Star's back and hold onto her, ensuring that Star could put the majority of her weight on Ellesandra if she needed it. If not, Ellesandra would simply help her balance as she walked. There were no words; she didn't need to say how uncomfortable she was with how Star's power was influencing her emotions. Even with the calming effect, her distrust and displeasure with it seemed to rise at first. Of course, if Star allowed longer contact that would go away, not enough to truly fight against any constant flow of calm, but for now - there was no way Star would miss that Ellesandra wasn't happy, but willing, to maintain contact here.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Star didn't, couldn't resist the hold on her arm the helped her up. She desperately needed it. Her weight instinctively leaned upon Ellesandra, clinging to them for support. The sustained hold did bring with it more; the longer the hold remained, the more Ellesandra would be able to feel what Star felt. Star of course was able to see what Ellesandra felt. But the touch seemed to bridge that connection further, to some degree. It wasn't as intense - not that Ellesandra could know - with this passive touch. But Ellesandra would be able to feel Star's exhaustion. Not as their own. But an innate understanding of what Star felt. A knowing that one couldn't put into words. How every step was labourous. How pain shot up her legs with each footfall. Star had pushed herself beyond her limits, as much was obvious. It had physical ramifications. Things she was clearly able to push past...To some degree. That she hadn't been wincing or whining in pain was a miracle; her control over her own emotions was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite significant. But she could not overcome the limits of her body, try as she might. Gratitude welled in her heart for Ellesandra, and Ellesandra could feel it intrinsically. The feelings did not pass onto the knight from within, nor did they require any effort to keep separated from their own emotion. The knight's guilt, their irritation, all of their own emotions remained as their own. And if the knight truly wanted, they would have no issues resisting the bond. Rejecting the sensations that flowed into them. Denying it all from influencing them would be trivial. It was not an invasive feeling. It was simply a calm, affectionate zephyr blowing through a window into Ellesandra's soul; the window would take no effort to close, even if the sensation was novel. Among the other things Star felt, if Ellesandra chose to open their heart and accept them, was...Guilt. Sadness. Loneliness. Longing. Determination. Some happiness, though it was coiled in a tumultuous storm of nuance and more complex feelings. All of this, without a lifetime of experience to decipher it, would be...Troublesome to make much sense of. To follow the threads of emotion and find their roots. The why for any given emotion was a mystery. But that the emotion was there was plain as day. And deeper, beyond this surface acknowledgement and understanding of emotion, was something more. A bridge that could be crossed. A lingering connection left separated. Ellesandra could reach out to it if they sought deeper understanding...But it begged the question whether that would be a two way street. Regardless of all that happened unseen to the two elven lovers, Star managed a much more steady stride while being supported by Ellesandra. Now that it had been forced upon her, she seemed to take it wholly, and completely. A suggestion that she wanted to take it all along...But the fear that she felt was still there. The worry. The shame. And as clear as it was written on her face, Ellesandra wouldn't even need to look at her to understand these things in the moment, so long as their physical touch remained.


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra hadn't expected to feel what Star felt. She almost pushed away, her instinctual reaction to break whatever connection there was between them, but she didn't. She frowned down at Star's legs when feeling just how tired and physically exhausted she was. Sighing, she stopped walking, bringing Star to a halt too. She had, indeed, created a solid emotional wall between them once she'd realized she could, mostly for fear of having her own emotions flow to Star like Star's was to her. Ellesandra didn't try to delve into anything they sense in Star, but feeling that physical exhaustion she moved to stand in front of Star instead, leaning down. "On my back." The words were an order - gruff, and still irritated. Start had pushed herself too far, obviously not knowing her limits. She'd pushed herself hard enough for it to be a danger to her, and thus to their survival in getting to this elven encampment. Ellesandra was leaning forward slightly, having removed her pack and set it on the ground next to them to make it easy for Star to lean into her back and wrap arms around Ellesandra's neck or shoulders. She didn't know if Star would do so without fighting, but Ellesandra was in no mood to argue the point. She was angry at Star for not saying something earlier, and there was guilt at not realizing just how bad off Star was. She'd trusted that Star had the remaining stamina, having not known Star enough to be able to tell the signs and how far she could push herself. That had obviously been a mistake.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

Feeling the support leave her side, Star nearly stumbled and fell over. But she didn't. She managed to keep her balance, then looked curiously at Ellesandra. The two elves felt it better they not say anything. It seemed this was business between the knight and the mystic. So they stayed quiet as Star lightly flushed in the cheeks. But she didn't fight. She did as asked, moving to Ellesandra's back to lean over them so she could slide her arms around their neck. Her hold was tender and thankful. Her skin was soft around Ellesandra's neck. She rested her head against the back of theirs, and eased her legs into their hold when the time came for her to be carried. Then, the emotions returned. Shame. Guilt. Gratitude. Admiration, even. Conflicting feelings that made for a difficult to unravel ball of emotion that was tightly coiled in Star's heart. But the relief was there. She was able to rest, and with that, the serenity that surrounded her grew stronger. Ellesandra still would easily be able to refute any actual influence her powers had on the other; they might recall Star had said previously that her powers of actual influence only really worked with those who didn't know her, and with how easily Ellesandra could recognize her powers for what they were, it certainly made sense how only someone unaware of who she was could actually be influenced by her against their will. But for what it was worth, Star's influence hardly was like a psychic. It didn't implant thoughts or override feelings. But it would be hard to feel violent against someone whose presence was so...Reassuring. Soothing. Calm. "I'm sorry.." came a quiet whisper into Ellesandra's ear, just for them to hear. "I didn't want you to think me a monster."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra closed her eyes, letting the feel of Star's weight lean in on her back. She hesitated for a moment, feeling all the emotions flow through again, but gritted her teeth and ensured her own barrier was up against the calming influence. Being calmer might theoretically be helpful right now, but she did not want Star's power influencing her or touching her emotions any more than they had to. She took her sack and glanced over to Morrun, tossing the sack at his feet without a word. The order was obvious; while she carried Star, he was to carry her pack. Only after that did she hoop her hands beneath Star's thighs, lean forward a bit more then pushed into a fully standing position. The cuts on her thighs screamed in irritation at the added weight, but Ellesandra kept her jaw clenched and ignored the pain. They were small enough that she knew this wouldn't do any real damage other than irritate them and cause more pain as she walked, which she could deal with. Her head turned to look at Star's sharply when Star admitted her worries. There was surprise, followed by confusion. Who in the world told Star that she was a monster? Just because Ellesandra didn't want someone peering into her emotions or influencing them did not mean she was a monster. Her power was unfortunate, and was one that Ellesandra would prefer not to interact with, but it wasn't monstrous - at least not in what she'd seen so far. "Don't be ridiculous." The words were scolding. She wanted Star to know that her being a monster was a ridiculous concept to Ellesandra. She didn't say more though, not with the two elves following along while Ellesandra began the walk again. The added weight would tire her out quicker, but the good thing was Ellesandra was used to hauling heavy sacks and equipment for long hikes. It wouldn't be a good or fun time, but she would be able to do it - especially because she wasn't experiencing any particular lethargy from haste spells or anything right now.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

A few emotions came in response to Ellesandra's words. More shame. Uncertainty. Confusion. A twisted gut that cried out apology for simply existing as she was. She might be able to see Ellesandra's emotions, feel them the way an empath could, but...That didn't give clarity to the reasons for them all. The emotions of someone who was lying were obvious to her. The emotions of someone with ulterior motives almost always gave them away, even those who were stoic and adept at concealing it all. But Ellesandra's emotions were...Complicated, and forced under a pile of rubble shaped as guilt. It made it tricky to know the first thing about them. It made it difficult to know when anger was inwardly focused, or when it was at Star herself. She said nothing further on the matter, electing only to rest and try to sort through her own feelings. She didn't pry into Ellesandra's. But her presence was there, open for Ellesandra to tap into any time, even if it was the most likely scenario that the walls remained up as much as possible between the two for the remainder of the trip. Morrun did manage the pack well, only occasionally needing to stop and rest his shoulder, which would give Ellesandra some time to set Star down and limber up before the march continued. And if the knight saw no further need to speak, there would be little beyond small talk between the husband and wife to fill the air as they walked through the natural path to their ultimate destination. Eventually, Morrun ran ahead a little. A hand rose up, then weaved a glyph in the air in green arcane energy, which opened up a hole in what was otherwise a rock face, revealing a path that cut into more of the forest. It grew more verdant as they walked deeper in. More green, more alive. A subtle mana clung to the air, reinforcing the natural growth in the area. It was pleasant and refreshing, but not very strong. Still, a welcome feeling after walking for so long; the sun had set on them, and it was well into night when they arrived. Morrun kept to the front, knowing they were in safe territory, and waved to unseen archers in trees to signal them that all was well. Nothing could be seen in those trees. A lethal place for any unwelcome visitors. But their safe passage led them to a sturdy wooden gate that had vines crawling up along the adjoining wall. Their approach was met with a raising of the gate, which allowed them into the settlement proper. Given the late hour and fatigue on everyone's bodies, Morrun turned to Ellesandra and Star with his offer: "I invite you both to my home. It isn't much, but I do have a spare bed." Spare bed, singular. "...Though I won't be offended if you'd prefer an inn. I'd happily pay for your rooms, if so, and can take you to it. We don't get many visitors as you can imagine, so its amenities are sparse, but...I don't know about you, but a rock would be a wonderfully soft pillow for me at this point. Whatever the case, I will have business to discuss in the morning with you both. A matter of my thanks, and honouring the original agreement, of course."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra tried her best not to feel or notice Star's emotions. Even as they came across the apparent link, she was doing her best to not only block out her own emotions from being noticed or felt by Star, but the other way around. Just like she felt as if it was invasive for Star to just be able to SEE the things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone, Ellesandra wasn't about to intentionally or actively do the same thing in the other direction. She'd give Star whatever privacy she could to process the emotions she had. When they stopped for a rest with Morrun placing the pack down, Ellesandra sat Star on a nearby rock for easy perching and moved to replace the bandage on her thighs. The walking with the extra weight wasn't helping it heal closed entirely, so she wanted to ensure it got properly taken care of. She also took some time to drink water and hand the waterskin over to Star, if she didn't have her own to drink - and then they were walking again. Ellesandra was quiet, which was normal for her, as they passed through the apparent illusion protecting the elven encampment. She also didn't say anything when Morrun ran up to greet someone, and as they approached even closer her eyes scanned here and there, watching out for an ambush. As much as she could watch out, anyways - elves were notorious for being able to hide in trees well. She was certain she'd missed some scouts at some point, even with her watchfulness. There was a wary caution about her; trusting Morrun not to intentionally lead them into danger, but also recognizing that there might still be danger either way. When they got to the place that was apparently Morrun's home, she glanced back at Star. "Point me to the bed and I'll put Miss Lumina in it. She needs her rest, I'm afraid her mission to rescue your wife took more out of her than she admitted." There was a gentle scolding to her voice again, but it was only partial. There was no need to beat a dead horse, after all. "If it's okay with her, I'll find the Inn and get some food and sleep there. I don't think she's in any particular danger from the two of you, or other elves here, is she?" Ellesandra's eyebrows narrowed as she asked the question, intentionally making it sound like a threat that if she was in danger, they would have to deal with her.



<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

There was some measure of guilt on the faces of the two elves upon hearing that Star had pushed herself so hard, but it was also plain and obvious that was the case. The two could do nothing but be grateful for what was done for them. "She'll have everything she needs to recuperate, I promise you," said Morrun, earning a smile and a nod of agreement from Lissana. A bed and a few home cooked meals was the least they could provide, though there was some mild and short-lived surprise when Ellesandra opted to take to the inn. Was there perhaps an...Assumption being made about Star and Ellesandra? They didn't comment. "Neither of you will be in any danger. Even if this settlement is for we elves, we shelter others plenty. Nobody will give it a second thought. If someone got in the gates, they are welcome," he said, then gestured down the residential street. The pathways within the settlement were made of wood which gave solid foundation to support over the otherwise soft earth. Through the main street the group came to a central square that branched off in several directions, including two wooden staircases that moved up and into the trees. Looking up, several buildings and presumably residences were built around the trunks of sturdy, tall trees; many of the trees in this grove extended up into the sky like spires. Mighty redwoods left to grow for ages, the most massive of which stood at what was presumably the heart of the city, wide enough in its circumference that it might take a solid half hour to walk a full revolution around the wooden pathways that were build around it. But for the time being, the group was more focused on their grounded section of the grove. Other elves moved around, not paying much attention to Star or Ellesandra, despite those two being the shortest people around, with everyone else reaching near or above six feet tall. It being so late at night did mean the activity was minimal, with only a few other denizens of the grove showing their faces, many of them just night patrol guards donning leather armor and sheathed blades with longbows over their shoulders. It was peaceful, and it seemed there was enough of a martial presence to keep the grove safe. Eventually, the two came to a humble wooden home. Not very large, but stepping inside did bring with it a cozy feeling. A simple, warm place to live. Morrun led Ellesandra through the main living space to a side room that had a guest bed ready and waiting for Star. It was certainly big enough for two with room to spare, supporting why the elves had been taken slightly off guard by the knight's insistence to take to the inn when there was space right there to sleep for them. But no questions were asked; once Star was set to bed, where she more or less fell asleep instantly, Morrun was waiting to meet Ellesandra by the door to the room after kissing his wife goodnight. "Be along shortly, love," he whispered to his wife, then smiled at Ellesandra. First, he handed the woman their pack with a bit of a grunt as he worked it off his shoulder; he'd needed to wear it on one shoulder while his own pack was on his back, and had swapped many times during the trip. "Dunno how you can bear to carry that thing," he said with a soft laugh. "Let me walk you to the inn, make sure you have your bearings so you can find your way back here in the morning."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra followed Morrun, eyes scanning the trees and the surrounding elves. At first, she had her guard up high, not entirely sure this wasn't some form of trap, but as they got deeper into the settlement and she saw plenty of signs of civilian elves, not just militia or military or anything like that, she began to relax some. She ignored the look between Morrun and his wife and instead eyed the area around the house before going in for the tour. When finding the guest room, she walked around the bed to take a good look at it before turning and lowering down to lightly place the sleepy Star onto the bed directly, encouraging her to relax her hold and fall back onto the bed. Ellesandra's thighs screamed at this, both from the exertion of carrying Star this whole way as well as their wounds. She gritted her teeth, fighting through the pain of that and her muscles reminding her she didn't do the same military drills she had previously to keep in shape. She wasn't entirely surprised Star fell asleep quickly, but Ellesandra did take a moment to ensure she got tucked in and had a pillow and was comfortable. She'd also been sure to remove Star's own pack or anything extra, though she didn't touch Star's clothing. The pack was set to the side, before she turned and followed Morrun out. She took the pack back, throwing it over her shoulders again, and nodding to him. "Years of practice, you get used to it when you carry your life on your back." She didn't remember the last time she'd settled down in any one place for more than maybe a week at a time, unless on a job. And even then, it wasn't often. Her gaze went around the place again while following Morrun to the Inn, waiting for the other shoe to drop and see why he wanted to guide her or if he had something else he needed to say.


<h1>Star Lumina</h1>

The walk to the inn was unremarkable. Morrun looked too tired to hold any sort of conversation. But he did genuinely want the knight to have their bearings in this place. A ways down the road from his home, then a right, then a left after some more walking, and they were closer to the central, massive tree. A few more civilians were about, but most were inside. The inn had clear signage: 'The Sleepy Seldarine'. Knowledge of elvish lore would reveal this to be a nod to an old elven pantheon, but it was little more than a name. Before stepping in, Morrun had but a single piece of business. A coin purse that he held out to Ellesandra. If taken and inspected, Ellesandra would find fifty platinum pieces inside. Each worth ten gold, which meant this was five hundred gold pieces worth of coin. "Please...Take this. For the inn, for food, for provisions, supplies..." Five hundred gold bought all that and a bit more within the first fifty gold, so five hundred was clearly for more than that. "...And as thanks for all you did. I was trying to raise the money myself to pay off the pirates, but as you can tell it was slow going. Too slow. I won't be destitute without this, before you go thinking I'm giving you the shirt off my back. But you deserve that, too. I had taken it on myself to help Star as a favour, a mutually beneficial thing. But in the time it took her to arrive, the pirates rolled in and took over and, well...You know the rest. You both will always be welcome here, but...Since you carry your life on your back, I suspect you'll be on your way before long. You've saved me from having a great tragedy in my life. If parting with a little coin can help spare you the same, then I won't take no for an answer. And something tells me Star isn't the sort to accept the deserved generosity of others." He smiled. "A pure heart like hers is lucky to have a cautious, sensible eye like yours watching over her. The world needs guardians like you. So, please. Lissana and I will be fine, thanks to you both."


Ellesandra 

Ellesandra followed along, only glancing at the sign. She didn't know too much about elves, so the name didn't ring a bell to her. When Morrun turned to hand over a bag of coin, she looked down at it, then up to him. One eyebrow raised, having not expected to be paid for this job at all. When he explained that it had been saved up to save his wife and wouldn't be impacting his livelihood itself, she reached forward and took it without a complaint. A quick glance inside to see the platinum made her tilt her head and look back up at him in surprise. This was way more than she would have charged even if she had hired herself out for the job. "I hardly think I should be considered a world guardian." She considered the cut to her thighs and how she'd let just three lowly pirates injure her. She'd underestimated the first mate it had seemed, and his willingness to harm his own crew in order to get her. "I'll be sure to share this with Miss Lumina before we part ways." Or should she consider this her payment to help Star along in her journey? It would still be more than she'd expect from that, not unless Star was hiring her for a long journey. Still, it was an option. "Was there anything else you needed? Otherwise I would like to change my dressings and then settle in for the night, and I'm sure your wife would like your comfort this evening after everything she has been through."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Morrun looked briefly perplexed by the notion of Ellesandra and Star parting ways. But, assumptions were cast aside and he nodded at the following words. "Of course. I don't mean to keep you. Good night, ma'am. Please come by in the morning so we can see you off." With a smile, he left Ellesandra to check into the inn. A simple process, name asked and recorded in the log book, payment of a single gold piece for a night's stay received, and key and directions given to the room. It was a comfortable room. A nice bed, simple amenities, including a magical shower that sprayed water from a blue crystal affixed to the ceiling of the small restroom that Ellesandra could use to wash away they day's woes if they so desired, either before or after sleeping. The room was theirs for the night, and a well-earned rest awaited them. Whenever they did come to find sleep, however...Their dream would find them in a waking, lucid state within it. Clearly understanding they were dreaming, the world around them took the space of a blank, black void initially. After a minute or so, focus came to the realm. A wilderness path. Not the one they had taken to the grove. Not one Ellesandra had seen before. The knight was in their full armor with their weapon at their hip, despite presumably falling asleep without it. The wounds on their legs didn't exist in this dream state. There was nobody around initially...But after looking around for a while in this dream, Ellesandra would spot someone. Or, what was presumably a person. It had a vaguely human shape, but was but a cloud of darkness. Black, smokey lines wafted up and off the figure. They were five-foot-seven, or thereabout. Not immediately identifiable as masculine or feminine in build. A vague black avatar of a person. Featureless. Unarmed. And despite the lack of eyes or anything resembling the same, Ellesandra would be able to know this figure was...Looking at them. Silent, for now, but...Watching expectantly.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra got her room and went to relax. She took good use of the shower, enjoying the water pouring on her head and letting it both wash away the sweat from the walk and the fight but also spending some time working on dealing with the emotions that had arisen that day. She tried to push them all back down into the box where they should have stayed the whole time, not coming out to hit her again at the sight and thought of Star. When she finally did change her dressings and get into bed, she was wearing just underclothes and had her armor and sword to the side, so it was strange waking up in her dream to...being fully armored. And in the wilderness. She looked around, obviously confused. Was this a dream, or something else? It seemed a bit more real than most of her dreams, but she couldn't really tell well. Typically when she dreamed, it was bad dreams; nightmares and memories she'd repressed and that only came up during her subconscious dreams. Now, she found herself staring at a shadowy black figure that she could tell was looking at her, but couldn't make anything else out about them. Her hand moved to rest on the hilt of her sword, prepared to withdraw it if needed, and she took up a more defensive posture in front of this creature. She didn't speak either, just watching it and waiting to see what it did, or if it made any hostile actions. It might not mean harm, but Ellesandra tended to be cautious and assume the worst.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The vague shadow figure didn't show signs of hostility. It simply spoke to Ellesandra, in a voice that didn't quite sound natural. The voice was as androgynous as the shape of the figure. "...She will die," said the voice. "History will repeat itself, as it does on, and on, and on again. Not tomorrow...But soon. To walk beside her in staunch defiance of fate...Or to turn and allow yourself the comfort of not knowing how, or when...I wonder which you will choose." As the voice spoke, a figure appeared before it. It was, quite obviously, Star. Bruised, beaten, bloody...But as they looked up at Ellesandra, their face changed. Shifted. It wasn't Star anymore, but the princess from Ellesandra's past. Tear-filled eyes, fear filling them as death loomed over them. Then, back to Star. Then the princess. Then Star. Shifting, melding together, interchanging with one another with swift flickers; it was a reflection of Ellesandra's subconscious association of the two women. The smoky figure remained still. But Ellesandra would find their legs chained at the ankles, with the chains taut and affixed to a mountain that was miles behind the knight. The knight could walk no closer to the smoky figure and the desperate woman that was on their knees before them. Ten feet separated them, but it was...A distance that could not be closed. Just barely out of reach. "To face the inevitable...Or to walk away..."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra was confused at first, when the shadow figure said she will die. Who would die? And then the figure appeared to be Star and Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She clenched her teeth, the rapier coming out of it's sheath as if to strike down the illusionary Star. She began to move to do so when the image changed. The rapier fell to the ground, clattering against the dirt as Star's form changed into that of Marigold's. Bright red hair was combed perfectly down her back, a single braid in a decorative circlet around the front of her head like she always used to wear. The freckles on her cheek standing out against pale skin and bright blue eyes looking down at Ellesandra. A wide smile that lit up her face, eyes that held hope and naivety and pure optimism for the world. Though at this moment, it wasn't that expression. Is the one Ellesandra remembered well. The look of surprise, tears in her eyes as she looked up at her captors, the pain and acceptance on her face as the blade was falling. "Mari!" The name, or nickname, escaped her lips without thought, as if saying it now would prevent the past from happening. Fuck, this was a nightmare, wasn't it? The image changed back to Star. From pure looks alone, they weren't very similar. But their dress, how they held themselves, their pure heart and happiness to help anyone and everyone they could, their stubbornness when they had made up their mind on something; it all struck deep. They may have different physical looks, but they were very close to the same beyond that. With the change back to Star, Ellesandra was broken out of the shock and grief that filled her again. "A dream." She said to herself, trying to stumble back away from the figure and tripping over the chains that had appeared. The normally graceful and poised bodyguard fell on her ass, looking down to see herself chained at the ankles in shock, then back up to the shadow creature that kept switching its appearance. "Get away." There was fear, there. Fear, anguish, guilt. She didn't want to be faced with the same guilt she'd been shoving down for years, and seeing Marigold's face had forced that back up so strongly that Ellesandra didn't have the presence of mind to try to mask her emotions or repress them. "Stop it."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
With Ellesandra falling on their backside, the figure changed back to Marigold. "Please don't leave me," said Marigold, her voice exactly as Ellesandra remembered it. But as soon as those words left Marigold's lips, it was Star again. But the pleading look never left her eyes. "I need you," said Star. But then was back to Marigold. One in the same, the two figures were shifting back and forth at random. The shadowy figure then extended one arm outward. In their hand formed a shadowy, deadly scythe. The tool of the reaper. The intent was obvious. "Run away," said the shadowy figure. "Embrace your cowardice," it continued. "Don't leave me!" screamed Marigold through choked sobs. Or was it...Star? Whichever woman it was, they were sobbing, crying out for Ellesandra. "Pathetic fool." The shadow figure's last words came as it swung its scythe down towards Star. But just before the scythe could strike and kill Star before Ellesandra's eyes, adrenaline spiked in their living, conscious body, and thrust them awake. It had been minutes in the dream...But the sun was rising in the waking world. It was morning.

Ellesandra
Ellesandra stayed on her ass, watching with wide eyes and mouth partially open, up until the scythe was heading towards Star. She threw herself forward, as if trying to block it, but she knew it was too late. She'd been on her ass, just watching, for too long - even if she were able to reach Star or the scythe while chained up. She wouldn't make it in time. Just as she was about to see the scythe split Star, her eyes opened and she shot up in bed into a sitting position. Her breathing was heavy and sweat covered her body. It truly had been a nightmare, one that she was sure she'd tossed and turned in. Had she screamed? She might have screamed there at the end, when Star was about to be killed before her eyes. She put her face in her hands and tried to practice deep breaths to calm her racing heart down. The sight of Marigold wasn't one that she was entirely unused to in her dreams; it wasn't the first time she'd had a nightmare of the day Marigold had died, but she usually hardly remembered the dream - just woke up from the nightmare and couldn't sleep longer. The addition of star, and comparison between the two, bothered Ellesandra. She moved out of bed and took another shower that morning; it was necessary with how much she'd sweat through the night, and to help calm her racing body and emotions. If she was going to go visit Star, she needed to get her emotions in check. There was no need for Star to see the panic and increased guilt at the idea of her leaving Star and Star dying because of it. She slammed the side of her fist into the wall and cursed to her breath. As she got out, she quickly dressed, but she left her armor off. There was no way Star was leaving today, and if Star planned to leave she was going to shove the woman back down into bed to rest, so if Ellesandra were to stay in the realms of the settlement there was no need for armor. As such, she found her way to Morrun's early in the morning wearing basic brown breaches and what would be a typical man's white jerkin, hanging loosely around the small curves she did have. Her rapier did still rest on her right hip, the only bit of her normal attire that she was wearing currently. She knocked softly at the door, wondering if this were too early to check on Star. She needed to, after that dream.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The knock was met with some shuffling and footsteps. The door opened, Lissana waiting to greet the knight with a smile. She opened the door and invited them in. "Please, come in! I was just making breakfast, I'll make some more for you. I hope you like hot cakes," she said, the elven woman clearly in higher spirits after a night's rest. Invited in, the kitchen was at the back of the home, with a dining room a bit before that. A simple table and seating for four. Morrun was nowhere to be seen, presumably up the flight of stairs to the right, possibly still in bed. The door on the left wall that led to the guest room was closed. "If you'd like to check in on Star, I'm sure she'll need a good meal as much as the rest of us. She might still be asleep."

 
Ellesandra 
//Will be a moment

 
Ellesandra 
She waited patiently, and when the door opened to Lissana, Ellesandra lowered her head in a polite greeting. "No need to go out of your way, Miss. I simply wanted to confirm Star was doing well, and then I'll be on my way. I believe the Inn has it's own breakfast too." There was a pause and she glanced past Lissana towards where the kitchen was. "Are you sure you should be up and about cooking already? If you need more rest or time with your husband to help recover, I would be happy to cook something for all of you." As much as Ellesandra wanted to rush to Star's room and check on her, she also needed to remember that Lissana had gone through hell the past few days as well. She may not have been on the verge of passing out, like Star was, but there were emotional and mental strains that Ellesandra probably couldn't see. Could Star? Did seeing that type of thing wear Star out more? She pushed the thought to the side. Maybe she'd ask at one point, but not right now.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Lissana shook her head. "On the contrary! A little normalcy is really helpful. Being at home, cooking for my husband and our esteemed guests is just what I need to...Feel normal again, you know?" she said, offering a smile to Ellesandra. "I...You can bet I'll not be leaving the safety of this grove for a while. But so long as I'm here, I'll be okay. So please, don't assume I'm that bad a cook," she said with a teasing smile. "I've some fresh fruit I fetched at dawn to go with it all. Please, I insist. You and Star are the ones who need rest. If anyone would take my place cooking, I'd say it ought to be Morrun, if my darling wasn't the sort to set fire to the kitchen for trying." Another smile. A kind woman, once she opened up. Long term trauma was more likely; a hesitance to ever leave what is known and comfortable. But the woman could face that in time. For now, it seemed assuming some normalcy was the therapy she needed. She could, however, just be adept at pushing it all down, like Ellesandra did. Only Star would be able to tell, but she was still presumably sleeping in the guest bed.


Ellesandra 
That made sense. Ellesandra nodded, relenting. "Okay, as you wish. I appreciate your hospitality. Don't let Morrun work you too hard though, he does deserve to do his fair share around here too." Ellesandra was joking, of course. She had no idea what Morrun did around the house and wouldn't actually judge him at all for it, either way. "I'll leave you to it while I check on Miss Lumina, but if you need any assistance don't hesitate to call out." She wanted the woman to feel comfortable around her, at least while she was here. It was entirely possible that she associate Ellesandra with death, since the first time she'd seen Ellesandra she'd been cleaning the blood of pirates off her sword. Or associate her with the whole horrible situation that happened. Walking through to the guest room door, Ellesandra gave it a very light knock. She didn't want to wake Star if Star were sleeping, but she also didn't want to just walk in without knocking in case Star was needing privacy for any reason. If there was no answer to the knock, she would lightly crack the door and peek inside, just to ensure Star was sleeping soundly and didn't look like she'd had a rough night or anything.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Lissana gave a giggle in response. "Worry not, he's around for all the things that need a little muscle or his big brain to figure out," she said back, then moved to the kitchen to resume her cooking. A simple breakfast, really, cooked over the fire of the home's oven. There was no immediate answer to the knock. Cracking the door would reveal Star was just waking, arms stretching up over her head with a big yawn. She then opened one eye as she rubbed the sleep out of the other. She smiled a bright, beautifully happy smile to see Ellesandra peeking through the door. Even if they were mostly obscured behind it, Star clearly recognized them by as little detail as just an eye through the crack. "Good morning, Ellesandra," said Star, sleepy but slowly waking. Seemed she didn't have a rough night. But as long as she could see Ellesandra, there was that...Stare again. Her way of checking on the knight.


Ellesandra 
Ellesandra let out a soft breath when she saw Star waking, and doing so in a way that seemed like she was okay. In fact, she had a bright smile on her face. The sigh of relief was minimal compared to the flood of relieved feelings washing through Ellesandra. She was fine, it was just a dream. She didn't know why she had dreamt it; likely, she had a subconscious fear of Star meeting the same fate as Marigold if Ellesandra didn't accompany her to protect her. Which meant, what choice did she have? There was a grief and anxiety that accompanied the relief, thinking about the dream and Marigold, but Ellesandra wrangled that into submission like she did with all of her emotions. A bottled up, ready to overflow emotional bomb, just waiting to finally release and explode, but for now it was bottled up. Not that this prevented Star from seeing it, however. Slipping inside and closing the door behind her, Ellesandra crossed her arms and looked Star up and down, checking for any signs of continued fatigue. "Stop that." Her eyes met Star's, at that stare that she was giving her. "I get that you can't control that you can see or maybe even feel what's going on in me, but stop actively trying to understand." A boundary she was at least trying to set. Though despite how abrupt her words were, Ellesandra wasn't angry. Nor was she ashamed of Star or what she could do. No, there was more...fear. Not afraid of Star herself, but afraid of someone seeing into her. Of asking questions. Of pushing her to process things she still wasn't ready to do. "How are you, fatigue wise? Do you need help getting out to the table for breakfast?" And a quick topic change, trying to encourage Star not to go down that route of conversation or ask why Ellesandra was so protective over how she felt.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star could see the emotions. The relief. The concern. It told her something was on Ellesandra's mind. Some guesses popped into her head, but she never assumed such things if she could help it. She was about to ask, but then the knight interrupted her before she began. She blinked, then blushed a little, and maybe even pouted a tiny bit. Understanding people was sort of her...Thing. Core to her being. So to have a wall slam down over it was clearly frustrating. Confusing, even. She heard the questions, the shift in topic. But Star was a bit too stubborn to just let them lead her along like that and pretend they hadn't said anything. "...Yesterday morning I told you what I saw. And you told me that there is no mountain," she said, her voice kind and gentle. Sympathy overtook her features, replacing the pout. "So...As far as I can see, until you point it out to me otherwise...There is no mountain," she said, speaking in words that only really made sense to the two of them. "That won't stop me from seeing the way the winds blow around the shape of what certainly isn't there. There's only so much I can willfully blind myself. And even that...I have no shame admitting that it doesn't sit well with me. But I do now, and always will, respect your privacy on the matter. I won't ask...But if what led us into the whole situation yesterday is any indication, I can't see suffering go unanswered. So at the very least...As long as we're together, I'll be watching. Even if there's nothing I can do...Sometimes it's just nice to know someone cares." She smiled, then swiftly sprung up from the bed, using Ellesandra's own quick diversionary tactics against them as she shot up to her feet. "As for my fatigue? All gone!" she said, beaming bright. "The only reason I was so drained was because I'd sapped almost all my mana for what I was doing. Casting the spells on their own was strenuous enough, but, ahehe...Casting spells in quick succession makes them exceptionally more taxing, and I only had seconds to do what I was doing to ensure we got out safely, so...Point is, I'm recovering! Not back to full strength I admit, but, I'm not sore any longer."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra's jaw clenched. Anger spiked at Star's words, though it wasn't really anger at Star. It was the grief of what that mountain was masking itself as anger because that was easier for Ellesandra to process. If she pretended the mountain didn't exist, she didn't have to deal with it. The comment about a mountain reminded her that she'd been chained to one in her dream, and the idea made her blink her eyes and turn her head to the side. Had her eyes teared up, just for a moment, before she blinked it away? No way to tell now, as Ellesandra was quick to turn after Star hopped out of bed to display how well she was doing now. "Good. You need your food then. Come out when you're ready." She could respond to Star's comment about someone caring, about being able to tell there was a lot Ellesandra was not saying to or showing her, but she didn't. Instead she slipped out of the room, leaving the door closed behind to give Star any privacy she needed. Ellesandra didn't go immediately, though. She took a moment in the hallway to ensure she was fully in control again, that her eyes weren't about to tear up once more, before walking down the hallway back towards the kitchen.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star didn't need to see a tear to see the emotions that caused it. Her expression remained sympathetic in the face of the tears, in the face of the anger, all of it. It wasn't like this was the first time someone had responded, well, emotionally to her stance on the matter. She almost expected it at this point. Star did take some time to get ready, namely by making use of the shower the elven couple had attached to the guest room. When she arrived to join for breakfast, her hair was damp and weighted down, but clean and pretty as could be. Her dress seemed to have had the blood removed from it from when Star woke just a handful of minutes earlier and now. Magic, perhaps? Regardless, Star took a seat just as Lissana was coming out with plates. Hot cakes, as promised, with two kinds of berry jam, a refined elven syrup that was sweet and earthy, and a large bowl of fresh fruits and berries to enjoy on their own, or perhaps to garnish the hotcakes with in the case of the berries alongside the jam. Adding to this, some meat sausage was divvied up on each plate to add some protein to the meal. The food was simple, but wholesome, and the elven cuisine had a hallmark elven complexity to the simple dish. Cold milk and orange juice was offered to drink alongside. Overall, an enjoyable meal that would give a good deal of energy for the day head. Lissana called up for Morrun once she laid out the plates, then joined the other two. Morrun shambled down the stairs, having clearly not slept the greatest, and joined the others with a smile after kissing his wife good morning. "So, Star, Ellesandra," began Morrun as he grabbed one set of cutlery to poke at a hotcake and take from the communal pile of them that was placed in the center. There were enough hotcakes for each person to have three of the medium-sized treats, but Lissana didn't look like a big eater. That, plus the huge helping of fruit meant there would certainly be leftovers unless Ellesandra had a bottomless gut. Morrun put some syrup on his hotcake. "What is the plan from here? I owe you the information promised, which will undoubtedly shape the next leg of your journey. I don't mean to rush, but I also don't wish to hold you up, so...If you intend on staying a while, as much can wait until after breakfast I'm sure. But I still am curious, if it's not prying to ask. Just, well...It would be nice to know that bright horizons await heroes like you both."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra would have offered to help set the table, but by the time Star came out she had been sitting in her own spot, having put her hair back up in a ponytail like it had been the latter half of the day yesterday, and staring down at her hands clasped on the table in front of her. Her fingertips were callused, hands rough; the hands of someone who had worked their life. Not just the hands of a warrior, but someone who had done manual labor as well, wielding tools as well as weapons. Her hands tightened as she struggled with her emotions, the bottle seemingly having sprung a leak. When Star sat down, she looked up and met Star's gaze for but a moment, but she couldn't look at Star long. Not while the memory of Star and Marigold's faces replacing one another was so present in her mind, from the dream. She looked away, happy for the distraction when Lissana came in with the breakfast and began placing them down in front of them. Ellesandra had leaned back, being respectful and waiting until Morrun arrived and began eating before she touched her own food. She was ravenous, and wasn't ashamed when her stomach had growled at the prospect of finally eating after the long day they'd had yesterday. She started with the sausage, quiet as Morrun began speaking. She glanced at Star for a moment, then back to Morrun. "For my part, it depends on Miss Lumina here. I'll be accompanying her until her mission is complete, so it's how she would like to proceed." It was a decision she'd come to, an easy one, after that dream. Even if it had been her subconscious bringing that image up, that she'd be running away from Star and dooming her to the same fate Marigold had, which made the decision easier, she knew she wouldn't have been able to just walk away. Not when Star so clearly indicated she needed the help. She didn't meet Star's gaze after saying this, eyes returning to her plate and using the food as a distraction to prevent meeting eyes or being questioned about that decision.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The surprise on Star's face was obvious. She looked at Ellesandra. If they had been alone, Star would have quite a few questions about when all this changed. But now she was facing down two elves where were...Also having trouble understanding. Morrun in particular had been told just last night that they were parting ways. Or did the knight mean in the eventual conclusion of this? It was vague, and very much not something he was about to bring up and possibly cause confusion or hurt feelings on the matter. So eyes went to Star. And at that point, Star just decided to not look a gift horse in the mouth. She had been struggling since she decided to venture on without Nina - a non-violent woman in a violent world, after all - so having Ellesandra was as comforting pragmatically as it was emotionally. It had only been a day, but...Ellesandra was an easy person to admire with the way they faced danger. Star also couldn't help but notice that her knightly companion couldn't look at her. But she didn't draw attention to it. As she said...There was no mountain. "Oh, uhm, well," Star began a little nervously. "I was hoping the information you had would lead me to a way to get to my home plane. I was told you had information about that, so I guess our plans depend on the details of what you have to share, Morrun," she said, specifically using 'our' in her words. Since Ellesandra was in it for the long haul, apparently. Happily joined, if confused about it, Star remained. Morrun nodded, pausing to finish a mouthful of hotcake before answering. "Right. Well. Let's finish breakfast then, and I can tell you all about those details. I don't wish to get your hopes up massively, but I will do all I can to help you along, all the same." Smiles were exchanged, and little more than small talk joined in on breakfast through to its conclusion unless Ellesandra had more to offer. The lion's share of the food was the knight's to have; Morrun and Lissana both turned out to be light eaters. Star enjoyed her share, a bit more than she might normally as she was recovering her strength, but seemed to prefer the fruit. Not that she didn't enjoy the hotcakes and sausage, but even with the hotcake, she smothered it in berries and seemed to delight in specifically the taste of the blueberries, with her face lighting up with delight in each bite. A favourite food, clearly, as unless others were grabbing them, she specifically sought the blueberries out to take for herself, looking a little sheepish and asking if anyone else wanted more before helping herself to the last of them. This left plenty for the knight to enjoy, and the group remained until it was clear all had their fill. Lissana then set about cleaning up, and Morrun and Star moved over to the living space so they could discuss what Star came here to learn in the first place. Star shot a glance at Ellesandra, inviting them to join along and hear what Morrun had to say.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had, at first, just taken one hotcake and otherwise added a lot of the fruit and sausage to her plate. She had eaten the hotcake without any of the jam, though as the meal went on and she saw how Star was reaching for the blueberries, she separated them on her plate and stopped eating them. As the conversation went on and Morrun confirmed they would discuss later, Ellesandra mostly tuned out the small talk. Oh, she was listening, but only for key words, her name, or if anyone addressed her specifically. Instead her eyes were down on her plate, eating in silence and trying her best to keep that 'mountain' bottled back down. The dream last night had really fucked with her sense of emotional stability, and that on top of how they had already been stirred up by Star herself. In all reality, it was probably Star's presence that had caused the dream. When she'd finished with what she was going to eat, and after Star had asked if anyone wanted the last of the blueberries, Ellesandra deftly lifted her own plate and moved to sit it in front of Star. It had what was remaining of the blueberries Ellesandra had gotten, properly saved to the side once she'd realized how happily Star had eaten them. She didn't say anything with the sharing of the food, but instead drank some of the milk that was provided and turning to Morrun, speaking up for the first time since the small talk had started, and simply asking him a couple of questions about the elven settlement - what it was like, the people, and how it defended itself against people like the pirates. Small talk that would distract from the small gesture of kindness, one that Ellesandra did not want to be commented upon. As they were finished and were moving to the living space to discuss the next steps, Ellesandra stood. She helped Lissana collect the plates and all the cutlery at least, but soon left Lissana to doing her normal duties and getting back into the swing of her normal life while moving to stand near the entrance of the living area. A habit of hers gotten from years of being a bodyguard; standing near the entrances and scanning the room, but not sitting to relax as part of the conversation.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star was a woman of emotion. That much was obvious. But even firmly knowing that, it might come to surprise Ellesandra that the simple act of thoughtfulness and kindness was enough to bring Star to tears. Actual tears. When she saw what the knight had done, the tears ran down her cheek. She took a moment to herself, dabbing a napkin against her eyes as she collected herself again. Her bright smile and giggles and assurances that she was fine were enough to keep the elven couple from worrying too much, but it was still quite the reaction. She enjoyed those last blueberries on Ellesandra's plate most of all, savoured one at a time. It resolved without incident, and things moved back to business. Morrun sat on the couch, facing Star who sat on an opposing seat, and both of them gave odd looks to Ellesandra who stood by the door, but neither questioned it. Morrun began with a clearing of his throat: "Right. Well. A bit about me, I'm a scholar of the planes. The Material Plane refers to central planes that are surrounded by inner and outer planes, as far as the scholarly understanding goes. But there are quite a few planes that qualify as Material. I understand from the description that you're from another such place, Star," he said, earning a nod from Star. "Right. So, to reach another plane like that requires some strong magic, or a portal. From what I observed, you were capable of using Dimension Door, the telltale door-like creations of that spell are quite obvious. Would you perhaps be capable of making stable portals for yourself?" asked Morrun. Star gave a small nod, though with a rub at her neck. "Yes, though...That's a bit tricky, and can be taxing to do. I'm still learning how to do more advanced things like that," she said, giving a nervous laugh. "No matter, no matter. That you're at least that familiar is enough. Because, well, the main thing that has had my interest as of late is that, about a year ago, there was some commotion a ways north-east of here. Along the coast, but at least another two days on the road on foot. Maybe one if you can go by coach. There were some ruins there, and some very curious individuals showed up to examine them. A band of adventurers, looked like. But notably, they had ears like a fox atop their head. Pointy and fluffy. Not terribly uncommon, but they uniquely did not have tails to accompany those ears. Combining that with their clothing and magic I observed them using, and I have it on good confidence they were from Myst." He paused for effect here. Star just...Blinked. This meant nothing to her. Morrun cleared his throat again. "...Myst is a plane outside the regular cosmology of the array of Material Planes. It's its own pocket of the multiverse, said to have been created a long time ago by someone known only as the Wizard of Myst. This place is host to interdimensional travelers, not unlike the githzerai or githyanki, though far, far less war-like than the githyanki. Myst, by contrast, is a place said to house two things that I think will be of great import in your mission to find your home. First...It is known as the city of gates. It is said if one can get to Myst, they can get anywhere else in the multiverse. Anywhere. From Faerun to Eberron to Ravnica to Dragonlance...Anywhere." His insistence was made clear by repetition. "And if you don't even know where to look? Well. It also houses what it calls the Athenaeum. Said to be the single greatest collection of knowledge in all the multiverse, a library of infinite and impossible proportion, if there is any knowledge that exists on where your home is, Star...It will be there. So. Though it has been quite some time, it may be your best bet to begin looking where these people have been, these travelers from Myst, and by whatever means you see fit, be able to follow them to Myst and, from there, go where you need to go. Of course...If ever that leads you back here, you'll have a bed waiting." A smile. "I'm...Afraid I don't have anything tangible on that regard, however. Myst is said to have a magical cipher that protects it from unwanted travelers, and of course a race of ancient elves that guard it, which is in part, how I learned of it. There is an elder elf here in this grove, Master Ridoru, who spoke of reveries he has had about being part of this legendary band of elves, known as the Arethi, in a past life. Not that I think knowing more on that front will help you find Myst, but...I'm sure if you feel the need to talk to him, I could secure an audience."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had NOT expected that reaction. She'd snapped her head up when she saw tears and there was a mixture between panic, confusion, and guilt. These emotions weren't attached to the normal guilt that Star might sense in Ellesandra, but separate. Had Star not wanted the blueberries? Was there something wrong with giving them to her? Why were there tears? Still, the rest of the meal seemed to go on past that, but the confusion and guilt didn't entirely go away with Ellesandra making a mental note not to randomly share food with Star again. She wasn't good at emotions, certainly not her own and definitely not others, so it wasn't easy for her to tell if those had been good or bad tears. As Morrun began explaining the magic, Ellesandra felt her head hurting a little. She understood some magic, being a spellsword of her own, but others she didn't. And all this interplanar stuff was way beyond her knowledge or experience. She knew some basic things, like there was a plane where you went to when you died, that Kelemvor would guide your soul to it's appropriate afterlife - whatever that might be and whoever you might worship - but anything in depth she didn't. The idea of this Myst place, somewhere that was apparently a gateway to any other plane, was a good start though. If Star knew the specific plane they needed to go to, they'd perhaps find a way to travel there from Myst. Her gaze went to Star, letting the mage lead the conversation for their side not only because this was her mission, but also because she knew more about it. Ellesandra did offer a - "We do have some funds available for travel, should someone in Myst need it, Miss Lumina." This might be news to Star, so she felt like it needed to be shared. She hadn't yet shared the coin Morrun had given her the night before with Star intentionally, but she would once they were out of the city.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star considered the information at length. She was surprised to hear that there were funds available. She of course had a bit herself, but she hoped to get more while in Cloverport. That didn't pan out quite the way she hoped. She was still getting used to the idea that Ellesandra was even coming with her, so that, plus now having money? All variables to consider. "I see," she said, curiously looking at Ellesandra. Not to study their emotions, but just to convey her pensive nature. Her eyes flicked to the floor, just picking another spot to look at that wasn't the knight, to keep them from being uncomfortable. "Hm. Well, it certainly sounds promising, and since I won't be able to do anything with portals at least until I am back to full strength anyway, a day of travel suits me fine. If we have the funds for travel, that helps...But I don't suppose coaches often travel from this grove, Morrun?" she asked, which had him think for a moment. He blinked. "No, the closest place to secure a coach would be..." He went a bit white, then. "...C-Cloverport. R-Right.." A nervous chuckle followed. "Right, well...Uhhh...Surely there's something else," he said, racking his brain. Star giggled, waving a hand. "I'm more than used to life on the road. We can instead use the money for some extra rations for the road to supplement what I can get from the land." A comment from Star that had Lissana poking her head out of the kitchen: "I've already put together some extras we don't need that you're taking with you, and that's final!" she said in a sing-songy voice. So it seemed the money could be saved for when it was later needed, if all that was secure. Star looked at Ellesandra. "Well. Unless you feel like going back to Cloverport to risk running into our lawless friends again, I'd say we have some walking to do, and only so many hours of daylight to get to it. What say you?"

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra shook her head sternly when Star indicated they might go back to Cloverport to hitch a ride. No, that was a horrible idea, and not one that Ellesandra would allow Star to follow without a very good reason. However, when it came to starting off walking, she crossed her arms and looked Star up and down again, assessing her physical condition. "Are you absolutely sure you are in a fit state to start off today, Miss Lumina? You were barely able to walk straight yesterday evening and you crashed as soon as I laid you down on the bed. It may be best to rest for another day at least before we head out." Ellesandra wasn't entirely sure what urgency Star was under. It seemed she didn't know if her mother was alive or dead, but there didn't seem to be an immediate urgency since Star had been willing to go out of her way to save Morrun's wife. Or perhaps that's just who Star was and she would have done that even if it was urgent, but Ellesandra was unsure. She narrowed her eyes at Star, trying to give off an intimidating presence despite her smaller 5'1 form and the threat having no real backing to it, since she wouldn't hurt Star. "I'm not going to let you tire yourself out like that again unless it's absolutely necessary. I understand it was a magical exhaustion yesterday and you're much better after your rest, but with how bad it was I'm not sure you should be travelling on foot today."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star pouted a little, but she still listened to all Ellesandra had to say. Sure, she could use another day of rest. But... "Mmmnh, it's not absolutely necessary, no.." she conceded. "It just...Feels wrong to be idle without just cause. Obviously the cause of rest is important, but.." There was nothing to follow the but. She obviously saw the wisdom in Ellesandra's words. The rest would be good for her. "Your legs should be rested, too, so I guess we'll have to. But will you at least let me tend to your wounds, if I'm agreeing to rest completely? My mana might as well go to some use," she said, trying and failing to put up any sort of attitude. Star was too sweet for any amount of pouting or dispute to be taken as angry. If Star actually got angry, it would be obvious. This was just...Pouty that she was being forced to be idle, forced to listen take the wise choice instead of the ambitious one. Sure, it could be that nothing happened on the road. But something just as easily could, and not being fully rested could be the difference between life and death on the road.

Ellesandra 
She was glad Star relented to not start the journey today, though when she suggested she should heal them, Ellesandra frowned again. The idea was reasonable, but she didn't know that she wanted to risk Star using her magic right now. She tilted her head to the side, considering. "This evening before you go to bed, IF you are absolutely confident your energy has restored and will be fine if you do it, you may tend to my wounds. Otherwise they're fine; I've received much worse than that without being treated for much longer, and I've treated these to ensure the bleeding stopped and they were disinfected. Additionally, they aren't even that deep, so no sewing necessary." While it was true that they weren't bad injuries, it was also true that Ellesandra wouldn't want to have to fight again with them still. It would effect her ease of movement, but only a little. Enough to allow Star to heal them? Maybe, only if Star was confident in her recovery of mana.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Morrun had a bit of a smirk about him as he listened to the two go back and forth, but remained silent about it. Star focused on Ellesandra, not able to see the wayward smirking. "Deal," said Star, then shot a smile at Ellesandra. "...So what do you want to do until then, Ellesandra? I mean as fun as I'm sure guarding the door against all the law abiding civilians out there is, there's no reason we have to just sit on our butts all day, right?"

Ellesandra 
There was a flicker of amusement in Ellesandra. On her face she didn't show it, not even a curling at the corner of her mouth, but Star would be able to see that the question and poking fun at her guarding the door amused her nonetheless. She sighed, as if very put upon, and said - "Well, I guess we can walk around and explore the settlement. I've been many places but I've not been to an elven settlement like this before, most of my interactions with your kind -" She had begun looking at Morrun as she said this, but paused as she realized how that might have sounded. There was an internal self-kick and a wince. "Er, I mean. I didn't interact with Elves much, and the trees are beautiful." That was a weak recovery, but there had been no malicious intent in the comment. Instead, it was more just an inexperience with elves in their natural culture, versus when they'd already assimilated into other nations or cultures.

Ellesandra 
// Might have to pause here for a bit - work meeting and then I'm really tired so I might nap after work. Need at least like a 20 minute power nap

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star seemed pleased with the idea of walking around among nature. And smiled even brighter when she saw the amusement rise in her companion. So they did have a sense of humour after all. How pleasant.~ Star then watched with second-hand cringe as Ellesandra said 'your kind'. Morrun didn't seem put off by it in the slightest, however, even with the weak recovery. A shrug was all he had to offer. "Elves are not everywhere. Our connection to the Feywilds ensures we always maintain reverence for nature, though it's nothing compared to that of a Druid camp. The magic they can cultivate for natural splendor is unparalleled. But it's true, we do invest our time caring for the nature here. Lissana does much more with that than I do, though, as she learned to speak with animals at a young age," he explained. Star giggled at this, though she didn't explain why. Maybe she just found it cute to imagine Lissana talking about her day to a squirrel. Star then rose from her seat to stretch. "Mmnh, well, we'll leave you for now then," said Star. Morrun nodded. "Dinner will be at sundown, I invite you both to join us, please," he said, smiling again. Star nodded back, then moved to Ellesandra, ready to move out the door and go walk around for a while on their day off following their heroic rescue. Though, once the two did move out of the home and the door was closed, Star abruptly turned to pull Ellesandra into a hug. "...Thank you, Ellesandra." The sharing of physical emotions that came with physical contact of course came along with this, and within Star's heart there was...Overwhelming gratitude, all of it for Ellesandra.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// This is a good place to pause for sure, I was going to have to go soon as well for the rest of the night, so we can pick up there next time!

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Be sure to rest up!

Ellesandra 
// have a good evening!

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Morning! Here to resume if/when you are ready!

Ellesandra 
//Morning! sure, gimme a moment to finish a few things up then I can post ^^

Ellesandra 
She looked at Star with confusion when Star giggled in regards to Lissanna speaking with animals. She wasn't quite sure what was funny about that, looking back at Lissana, before shrugging and following Star out the door. She had started to turn to Star to see if there was anywhere in particular the mage wanted to go when she felt Star abruptly pull her into a hug. Ellesandra froze, statue still. Her arms were out to the side like someone who had gotten hugged and been surprised by it, and she was looking at Star with wide eyes. The feeling of Star's appreciation, gratitude flooded her and kept her rooted to the spot, and it took her a moment to realize what was happening and recover from her shock. When she did, the barrier on her emotions that she'd worked at maintaining all day yesterday, while carrying Star, slammed back in place to prevent Star's emotions from piling in and calming her again. She took a deep breath and lightly wrapped one arm around Star, patting her back in the awkward 'there there' motion of anyone who was unused to physical touch like this. "...Come on." She said, motioning with her head down the path for them to begin their exploration of the area. She felt awkward and confused with Star hugging her, and she could feel the way it caused her heart to skip a beat and the guilt and grief that began to stir much further down. She didn't want the hug to continue, but she didn't push Star away, either.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
There was a small worry in Star's heart that she might get pushed away. The worry would pass along, though the reason for it would remain nebulous to the knight. Just another emotion in the chaotic storm of emotion that they were exposed to when touching Star. A storm that would be difficult to unravel for even someone well versed in their own emotions, so for Ellesandra? It all remained a confusing mystery until it was blocked off. Curiously, the act of drawing the division was easier on this day. It appeared to be a skill one could hone as they grew more familiar with Star's magic. A skill that would allow them to either better make sense of the chaos and noise in her emotions, or to block her out more completely. Control, in essence, was afforded with exposure. Marginal for now, but noticeable. Ultimately, Star held the hug for a short while, concluding it with a gentle squeeze, and parted with a smile. Star obviously could tell that it was difficult for Ellesandra. The discomfort, as if a hug was alien to them, had Star wearing sympathy and understanding upon her features as hands daintily folded behind her back. "...For staying," she began. "For walking beside me, instead of continuing on your own path." She then wore a brighter, happier, slightly playful smile. "...And for the blueberries." A giggle followed. "I guess it's pretty obvious how they are my favourite, isn't it? You probably felt like it was nothing. But in both the small and big moments, I have seen nothing but kindness in you. And it makes me really happy to know you." She let those words linger for a moment, hanging in the air. She debated speaking in terms Ellesandra understood, in saying her piece and then abruptly changing the subject to deter the other person from saying anything about it. On one hand, she considered that a kindness for the knight, to not force them to face the genuine emotion in Star's words. But on the other, she feared that saying what she had, and then immediately setting off to wander around like nothing happened would stifle Ellesandra further and reinforce the notion that emotions weren't a conversation, but just a series of random statements said at will and not to be discussed further. So, she elected to leave the silence to linger, so Ellesandra could decide how they wished to respond. She expected them to just clear their throat and pick a direction to start walking, and if that is what happened, she would be fine with it. But on the small chance Ellesandra had a response, Star didn't want to take away their chance to say it.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra pursed her lips together, eyeing Star when she finally pulled back with that gentle squeeze. There was part of her that immediately missed the contact. The part of her that had been touch starved for years now, having little to no real physical contact with people. Even when she'd taken lovers the past few years, it had been her touching them - not much of the other way around. The thought was pushed out of their mind and Ellesandra turned to look down the path, not meeting Star's eyes at all the thanks, and the comment about her kindness. She took the desire to be touched again and shoved it down, letting that discomfort with the whole situation be the main emotion Star would see - or at least, that's what she tried to do. She had no idea how much Star could see, or if other large emotions blocked sight to the smaller ones. "Yes, well." She said, clearing her throat awkwardly. Changing her plan for the money Morrun gave her for them both, she reached for the pouch that had it and unhooked it, tossing it over to Star. "I've been paid for my services, and part of that is making sure my client is happy. If blueberries make you happy, it is my duty to provide." It was a cop out. A guise to hide behind, in that her kindness or actually wanting to protect Star wasn't true, but just the job and the duty expected of her. Hiding behind duty was easy, even if a five year old could see through the lie. As the one hiding, it helped ease Ellesandra's emotions to think of it this way. "Morrun paid us for the rescue. I took my pay, the rest is yours to use." This also wasn't true. She hadn't taken but one platinum out of there, to use for her inn room last night and to test to ensure that the coin was good. Of course the platinum had been overpaying and she'd gotten change in gold but still. Ellesandra didn't even consider how easy it was for Star to tell she was lying, that thought not even being a consideration as she began walking away from Morrun's house, choosing that moment to go with the 'end the conversation and walk' path. "Lets go see the sights, it's not every day you get to roam an elven settlement."

Ellesandra 
// Stepping away to grab a coffee from the local cafe, will be like 10-15 minutes, so might be a minute delayed in next post

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star had a bit of a fumbling reaction to catching the coin purse. Her hands were behind her when it was thrown at her after all, but she did catch it. She frowned, looking at the coin in the bag. Then went wide-eyed. That was...A lot of money. It became quite a bit less so when dealing in magical items which could gobble up the wealth for just a few modestly useful things, or even all on one single thing of modest value or rarity. She then looked at the house Morrun and Lissana owned. Guild began to rise in her own self. Not something Ellesandra would be able to see on her aura, but certainly on her face. Of course, the only thing she could think of with this is how much it could improve the lives of the elven couple. "I'll take a few coins and return the rest, then, since you've taken your pay," she said aloud, quite thoroughly justifying Morrun's intuition to pay Ellesandra. Goodness knew that what Star 'needed' was a paltry sum out of the pile. Five coins maybe. And not that Star knew it, but doing so would certainly expose Ellesandra's lie about taking their pay. And that didn't even begin to touch upon the way Star looked at Ellesandra after this statement with a face that clearly said 'if you're going to lie to me at least make it convincing' as she considered the cop-out line about blueberries. It was almost enough to get Star to lash out at them. But she'd only known Ellesandra a day. She feared being too insistent on the matters of emotion, about insisting on honesty, would push them away. She had, less than an hour ago, learned that Ellesandra was staying with her until she concluded her mission. A promise that...She wasn't sure Ellesandra fully understood, given how long Star had been at this already. But one she desperately needed. So she swallowed her emotions and simply said, as Ellesandra was walking away: "...There is no mountain." She then drew in a deep breath, huffed through her nose, and turned to catch up with the knight. Curiously, the pouch of coins was nowhere to be seen. Star also didn't carry a pack, as Ellesandra would have noticed while they were moving from Cloverport to the elven settlement. Did she lose it? Where were her supplies? Did she toss the coins into Morrun's home when Ellesandra wasn't looking? She just had her dress, as if that were her only possession. That all aside, she walked beside the knight in their plainclothes. The settlement was of decent size, but more vertically sprawling than horizontally so. The exploration revealed a fair amount of services the elves had; a smithy with a few workers, several bakers, artisans, a small library, a small prison, and a handful of other sorts. There didn't seem to be any sort of tavern or analogue for it, though there was a shop selling fine elven wines, some aged upwards of fifty, even a hundred years if the two poked their head in to peruse the wares. It was decidedly civilian, with enough similarity to human settlements to make it feel familiar. Beyond the services, however, there were communal spaces for the elves to gather. Places for them to be together, be merry, to sing and to dance, places to hone their accuracy with bows and form with blades. A place for the children to learn and be safe. The occasional elf regarded the two humans walking among them with curiosity. Another, with knit brows. Racial lines did breed strife on occasion, but as Morrun promised, there was no overt hostility. A few hours passed as they traveled around, taking in the sights and sounds, though it all carried a familiarity that prevented anything from standing out enough to linger on. They were just finding ways to idle the hours away, it seemed. That was until they found their way to the far side of the settlement, which had a bountiful garden to behold. Star's eyes went wide, and she sped along ahead of Ellesandra to step onto the walking path laid out with mosaic stones that passed between two rows of flowerbeds that were adorned with flowers and flora of all colours and sorts. Rainbows of blooms arranged with careful precision that sought perfection in the craft. The stone path led forward onto an open, grassy field that had patches of flowers dotting the greenery. It was a beautiful meadow, one that Star giggled with glee as she ran into, did a pleasant, happy spin on one leg, then let herself fall onto her back onto the soft earth. The sun glittered down onto the meadow, casting god rays through the trees to illuminate it in its warm glow. Some other elves were in the distance in this large meadow, keeping to themselves and simply living among nature. But at least for the moment, Star was occupying a little slice of the meadow to herself, obviously elated by the natural beauty on display.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra frowned at Star's comment about returning the rest. "Take at least half. If nothing else you can find uses to donate it to on the journey." The request was made as more of a suggestion. She would prefer Star have the funds necessary to ensure safe travels, though also knew that Star would want to use the money for other kind acts in the future. She could spread that out, leaving some for the elven couple and then using it on the road as well. The no mountain comment made her visibly flinch. Her teeth gritted and anger rose, anger and denial swirling around the mountain that was obviously there, even if hidden and ignored by Ellesandra herself. This made the first part of their journey through the town not very pleasant for Ellesandra, working to rein in said anger and focusing more on that than enjoying the sights around them. The smell of the bakery got her attention, that and the smithy were the main things Ellesandra was looking at when not doing base scans for danger. Despite this being essentially a day off for them, she was still with her charge and thus needed to ensure no surprises were waiting. Ellesandra was quiet on the little tour of the town, impressed with the way they integrated their entire culture into nature but otherwise it seemed just like any other town. When they made it to the gardens and the meadow, she was taken aback by how much Star seemed to enjoy it. Running forward and spinning in the fields, Ellesandra found herself watching the just pure unfiltered joy in star with envy. She didn't remember the last time she'd been able to feel joy like that. A sinking feeling sat in her chest again, one she couldn't identify. Loneliness and regret was there, but it had been long enough that Ellesandra let herself feel either in this context that she didn't even realize what it was. Instead, she found a bench or a stump or something to sit on and settled down, watching Star just laying back in the meadow for a moment, before glancing around to see if there was anyone else around they might be disturbing. Keeping guard, like normal, with the same stoic expression as always despite the aforementioned feelings getting stronger.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star hadn't seemed too keen on the idea of taking half. As kind as Star was, she had moments of being stubborn. The coin bag was gone, either way. Star literally could not help noticing the anger, but she didn't speak to it. She did think on it, however. And happy as she was, there was a desire to share it with her dutiful knight. Sure, it was possible there was danger, but they had been assured this place was safe. And it wasn't like Ellesandra was in their armor right now. Not that she'd want to take them on in a fist fight regardless, and felt pity for anyone who tried, but there was a mild poutiness about Star with how Ellesandra didn't have an off switch. "Hey, Ellesandra, get off your stump and come lay in the grass with me!" she called out, briefly propped up on her arms. She pat the grass next to her, then smiled. "It's a beautiful day!"

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had sat on the stump just as much to keep distance from Star as to keep an eye out. Yet when Star propped up on her arms to invite her out, Ellesandra stared at her with a mixture of confusion and amusement. Why did Star want her to spend time with her like this? Ellesandra had proven to be a grumpy, unfun person so far hadn't she? Yet Star continued to try to pull her in. She didn't answer for a moment, watching Star and then glancing around the fields, before sighing in acceptance and standing. "As you wish, Miss Lumina." She could still hide behind the job, doing what her client wanted, in the form of her acceptance here. She walked forward, careful not to crush any of the flowers in the meadow - or as careful as she could be, anyways. She turned and lowered herself to sit next to Star's laying form. She didn't lay down, but did lean back on her own elbows, looking up at the sky rather than at Star next to her. "It is a beautiful day." She relented, agreeing with the comment.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star paid particular attention to how Ellesandra didn't trample the flowers. It made her smile, though from the knight's point of view she was just smiling because, well, Star did smile a lot. She was a happy person, generally. Until something sad happened. Then she was sad. As if she had some sort of empathetic magic or something. But she did happily welcome the other to her side. She knew touching them was...Not the knight's favourite activity, so she refrained from helping herself to using their lap as a pillow, despite the urge. Instead, she laid back, hands resting over her abdomen. "You can just call me Star, you know. I keep waffling about matching your formality and using your last name and saying that's silly and just using your first name. I've decided to just use your first name. So you should do the same." She smiled. "My mom gave it to me, after all. Picked it specifically for me. Be awfully rude not to make use of it, don't'cha think?" she asked with a playful voice, looking up at her companion. It was flimsy logic, but she clearly knew as much and just wanted to be called by her first name regardless.

Ellesandra 
There was a sudden pain that rose in Ellesandra's emotions at the mention of Star's mother giving her her name. It was enough that Ellesandra actually showed a response on her face, eyebrows coming together and her mouth creasing into a frown. She still didn't look at Star, remaining in her position until it became uncomfortable on her arms, and then leaning back entirely to lay down in the grass. She wasn't quite sure how to respond at first, wanting to decline Star's invitation to use her first name, but not knowing how to do so without insulting or offending the woman - or her mother, considering what Star had just said. So instead she pushed the memories of her childhood back down so the pain wasn't up front again, and nodded. "As you wish, Star." Her words were a whisper. A gentle give to the formality that normally was insisted upon to keep an appropriate distance between her and a client; something that she couldn't find she could enforce with Star. Star just had too much positive energy and happiness to deny her something so simple. She took a moment to glance around, not letting her guard down despite laying in the grass with Star, before looking back up to the sky. "Must be beautiful here at night, with the stars." A topic change. Still something more than she normally would have commented on, but it was a give and take. Give that, prevent questioning into the pain that she knew Star probably saw at the mention of a mother giving a child their name. Just another part of that mountain which didn't exist.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star was smiling at first, but then frowned when she saw Ellesandra do the same. She had touched something there, hadn't she? She couldn't know, of course. Only know the other woman's hurt. She knew the knight's game by now. Every comment was calculated. It was a difficult topic to broach...She still didn't want to risk pushing the other woman away with inquisition. So she went along, this time. She would have to choose her moment, if she ever intended to try and chip away at the cold armor on Ellesandra's heart. "It's what I was named after. My mother's name is Aurora. My grandmother was Luna. Great grandmother, Aelia., which means 'sun'. My home has a lot of connection with the celestial bodies. The beauty and mystic grace of it all...My mother told me of how it is the destiny of my family line to bring light into the lives of others. She told me a story of how a single, guiding, bright star in the sky guided her to the woman she'd eventually come to marry. My...Other mother, Robin, didn't survive until I was born, I know that much. But my mom, Aurora...She said that I was that star that guided her, and descended from the heavens to be with her once I did." She giggled, tears having formed in her eyes. She was smiling, but...It was clearly painful to talk about, given the situation. "So every time I look up at the stars, I make sure to look for any bright ones. See if maybe there's something up there trying to guide me." She sniffled. "I know it sounds silly. But since we'll be here for the rest of the day...Let's come back here to look at the stars tonight, once the sun sets. See how beautiful it really is."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra glanced over at Star when she heard the sniffle. She eyed the water building in Star's eyes, and without a word slid her hand into a pocket and pulled out a handkerchief. It was silver with gold threaded emboss on it, of the same type of designs as was on her armor. There were initials on it, M.K., in the center. It looked relatively fancy, especially for something that the knight would be carrying around. She handed it over to Star to use to help dry her eyes before looking back up to the sky. "That's a lovely story." The response seemed...well, Ellesandra had more to say, there was more that she could say, but she didn't. It was all withheld, restrained. Instead, Ellesandra leaned her head back into the grass with a deep sigh, closing her eyes. "Returning tonight sounds like a great idea." They could probably return after having dinner with Morrun and Lissana, since they'd been invited there. Ellesandra wasn't sure about imposing on their hospitality more, but it seemed like it would be rude to refuse. Even if she was staying in the Inn rather than their place, with all her stuff still back in her room at the Inn, refusing their food seemed unnecessary. "Have you found any bright stars up there, guiding you?"

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
If Star didn't have the intuition to know that Ellesandra felt more than they let on, she might be offended by the curt response to her story. She accepted the handkerchief and did use it to dry her eyes, then admired the stitching on it. She sniffled again. "This is...Really nice," she said, taking note of the initials. M.K...Unless Ellesandra had a completely different name, it wasn't theirs. So...Who did it belong to? Whatever the case, it was important enough to keep, so Star would not dare sully it with anything more than a few teardrops. She held it gently, with a clear reverence, as if she implicitly knew it was very important to the knight at her side. Not much could get past her in that regard, after all. So it was handed back with care once she was done with it. Even if her eyes were still a bit wet, she dare not use it more. Then, the later question evoked a small nod. "I did, once. It led me to Nina. She's been a very good friend over the years, and that's a story you might find familiar, as I found her in the midst of peril and saved her. She's returned the favour plenty over the years I've known her. And she found love, or at least...For a while, she did." Star shook her head. More to the story, clearly, but not important enough to get into. "Of course I know it's just a silly coincidence. But there's something to be said about it happening twice. Maybe it'll happen again. Maybe it'll happen enough times that I'll have a much harder time just believing it coincidence."

Ellesandra 
// I'm back! That meeting took way longer than I expected, sorry

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// All good! I'm in one now so might be delayed on my end on replying

Ellesandra 
// no worries. I'll get a post shortly

Ellesandra 
The comment about the handkerchief being nice was ignored, at least verbally. Ellesandra obviously heard it because the grief, and the guilt, all hidden beneath the large mountain of repression Ellesandra had, leaked out a little. Marigolds handkerchief was the only physical thing Ellesandra had left of her, so yes it was quite important to her. She kept the conversation going beyond that though, ensuring that her talent at avoiding those conversations didn't go unused. She glanced over at Star, curious as the story was told. She wasn't certain, but she'd gotten the impression Star and this Nina might have been involved themselves, at least as much as you might with a travelling companion in a friends with benefits way. The indication that Nina had found love, at least for a time, made Ellesandra curious how Star felt about that. She didn't ask though; it wasn't Ellesandra's place to ask probing questions when she herself would refuse to answer any similar ones. "Maybe it will. Even if it doesn't happen again, doesn't mean that it was coincidence. The gods and goddesses work in weird ways, and with how your entire family seems to be named after and related to the stars or celestial bodies in some way, I wouldn't put it past the appropriate Deities finding favor within your family and sending you messages that way. Or just playing around with you."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The confirmation that the handkerchief was important came not from a physical tell, but, as was often with Star, an emotional one. Good that she was careful with it. A rag, she might have blown her nose on. Never would she dare use that precious keepsake for anything in the future, even dabbing her eyes. She sniffled again, then giggled. "I would hope they aren't playing around with me, if that is the case," she said, then looked back up to the skies. "...Have you ever had anything like that, Ellesandra? Anything that seemed to be like a coincidence? I mean...Other than you stumbling across me being in danger, of course. I have to wonder how much fate had a hand in that."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra shrugged. "It's luck, or it's fated by the gods. And I don't much care for putting my life and my destiny in the hands of the gods; spiteful prideful beings who would use people like us and then throw us away. So there have been times that I've been lucky; I've gotten very luck in my life time, being able to be trained where I was and accepted into their ranks." Her comment was offhand, vague enough that Star wouldn't be able to get too much detail from it, but it would be obvious from her that what Ellesandra mentioned was something that she'd been grateful for, at the time. She still felt grateful, for whatever she was referencing, even if there was still pain in the memory. She waved her hand, dismissing the notion and idea. "Things happen, if they're fated then no point in fighting that, but if they're not then I'm going to make my own decisions and let luck and coincidence fall where it may."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star listened quietly, keeping an eye on the woman for their emotions as the story went on. Gratitude was a nice emotion to see. It had her smiling, though she could only imagine that such gratitude came from an upbringing that was more destitute. A person born in privilege feels they deserve everything they get, after all. She didn't mention this, but she made the quiet assumption to be confirmed some other time. "Quite the pragmatic view on it all. I've never been particularly pious, so I don't have much to say for or against the notion of the gods. I'll just have to take your word at their dispositions." There was an odd disconnect about bad stuff being gods and good stuff being luck, but again, she didn't say anything. "It's not surprising that you are someone who seeks to take control of their own destiny, though." She smiled. "We have that in common. I like that about you."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra knew gods could bring about good stuff, too. They just hadn't for her, and it wasn't dependable. You could make your own good stuff. Most of what she'd seen the gods do had been negative, in some form of fashion. Not that she had much interaction with it at all, anyways, she was just biased. At the last comment, Ellesandra finally looked back over to Star and raised her eyebrows at her. "Take control of your own destiny? Didn't you just say that you were looking for a star that a deity would use to guide you to your next...I don't know. Lover, if that's what happened for your ancestors, or just friend?" She sounded amused a little. Maybe poking fun at Star, but only lightly and not seriously. Testing boundaries, more like, as she looked back up at the sky. "What do you have planned when you find your mother?" When, not if. She believed Star would find her mother, though if she was dead it might not be in the way Star wanted to find her. There was curiosity about how they got separated anyways, but again not something that Ellesandra was going to pry into.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star was smiling bright as the two talked. It felt like for perhaps the first time, she was holding a conversation with Ellesandra that was about them, not just the situation they were in. Even at the subject of her mother, she didn't lose her smile. She giggled at the light prodding. "Just because I seek guidance where it might present itself doesn't mean I am not fighting for what I desire. I think I've proven that I'm not averse to taking risks. I think you'd be a lot less stressed out being near me if I was," she said, prodding back to the woman with a playful smile and lilt to her voice. "And, well...I've never been in love. Not aside from love for family, of course. Romantic love." She was still a virgin, but she wasn't about to go saying that out loud. "And not for lack of meeting people, mind. Maybe it's just the vagrancy, but...I've never felt that way about anyone before. I've felt...Attraction, certainly. Enough to know what kind of people I'm attracted to, though that's always been kept inside. Never uh...Told someone I, you know...N-Never mind. But I'll always take more friends. Making friends wherever I go is how I like it to be. As for my mother? Well....Depends on if she is alive of dead I guess. If she's gone, then I will just need to make sure I care for her legacy, and that she is properly set to rest. If she's alive...Then I never want to be separated from her again. N-Not, you know...Like live with her or something. Just make sure that I can see her regularly. Learn from her. Understand myself better," she said, looking down at herself as she did. A pensive introspection overtook her. "...You can't really know what it's like to be born like me, of course. I've had this gift since birth. Mom helped me understand it, but there was a lot I had to figure out on my own, too. It's...An intuitive thing. Not something that you can really explain. But certain things just click after you focus on them for a while. At first, I remember reading an aura was really hard. Just a...Chaotic barrage of emotions constantly. Lots of headaches, and trying to make sense of things that rejected understanding." An apt description of what Ellesandra felt, to a very mild degree, whenever touching Star as the power connected their auras. Confusing, despite the comfort. "But over time, little by little, having experiences with people helped me understand them, and understand me by extension. I've been lucky, too. Lucky that a lot of people have helped me, yourself certainly included. So...On one hand it's a little selfish of me, as my mother is the only person who can really help me with this in a way that isn't just me figuring it out myself. But that aside?" She closed her eyes. "...She's my mother. I love her. And she loves me. I know she would come for me, if she could. So either she is out there looking for me, and we haven't found each other...She's dead, and can't look for me...Or she needs help. Whatever the reason, I have to find her and know for sure. It's..." She paused, pursing her lips as her eyes opened again. "...Have you ever felt like...You can't move on with your life? Like something holds you back from doing that? For me, that's...This. I need this. Then...Then I can think about settling down and having a life that is more about me. And I hope to help a lot of people out along the way."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra listened as Star rambled about her lack of being in love, and her interactions with people as that. It caused her to raise her eyes again, but it was more curiosity as to why or how, and not judgment at Star's inexperience with love. It sounded like she might not have told someone she was attracted to them, either, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. It certainly wasn't her place to pry into how many people Star had been with, sexually. She was silent as Star transitioned into speaking about her mother, and what she'd do when finding her, and her powers. When Star asked that of her, though, she reached to the side and picked a single flower, holding it up above her head and slowly curling the stem round and round itself, up the stem until it created a much smaller stem that was stronger, but obviously different from how it had started. It curved to the side instead of going straight down, and Ellesandra picked another flower, curling it's stem around the first. She was making a circlet of flowers, though it would take quite a few more than just two, and she wasn't in a rush to complete it as they lie there. The silence stretched, the unspoken mountain rumbling with the pain, grief and guilt over what Ellesandra herself couldn't move past - what was holding her back. Her eyes were focused on the flowers in front of her as she worked, but the whispered words came out. So softly that Star might wonder if she'd imagined them. "There is no mountain." She clenched her jaw again, and suddenly crushed the start of the circlet in her fist, tossing it to the side and sitting up, back to where Star was laying. "You take risks like what you took for Morrun and Lissana, and you very well might not make it to finding your mother." Now her words were scolding, a defensiveness for the little she'd just opened up in and slammed that look into her emotions back down again, overcorrecting. "So don't let your helping others distract you from finding your mother, if you want to actually do so."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star was quietly smiling as she saw Ellesandra weaving a circlet of flowers. It was cute. Though, she watched as the tranquility, brief as it was, was overtaken by defensive anger, frustration, and a myriad of other emotions swirling in the knight's aura. The flowers were crushed and the woman was defensively faced away from her. The words that followed didn't hurt Star, like they might have been meant to. She kept calm in the face of them. "I know," she said quietly. "But I...Like who I am. Not that I don't have my failings, of course. I've plenty of those. But I like...That I am not afraid of dying for a good cause. Obviously I'll try to do all I can to avoid that and...I know I have no business flinging myself at something I have no hope of surviving. I pick the fights I know I can take, even if I recognize I might get hurt along the way. Knowing what would have happened to Lissana if we hadn't intervened...I'd make the same decision a million out of a million times. There's...Enough suffering in this world that I am forced to turn a blind eye to. So...As much as I'm able to," she said, moving from laying to being on her knees. She then moved behind Ellesandra and, with as gentle a motion as she could, embraced the other woman from behind, looping her arms around their neck to hug their shoulders and collar. "I want to give people their smiles back when something has taken it away from them. I'm no miracle worker, but...It's a promise I keep to myself, that I will always do everything that I can." With that, she didn't wish to overstay her welcome. A small squeeze, then slowly retreated from Ellesandra, unless she saw reason to keep the hold.

Ellesandra 
She didn't look at Star, even as the mage seemed to brush off her words. Her knees came up and she wrapped her arms around them, leaning forward away from her and staring out over the meadow. Her rapier was at her side, awkwardly putting pressure against her hip from the way it angled against the ground, but she didn't bother repositioning it. In a way, the discomfort that brought helped ground her. The thought came into her mind, that even if Star was willing to risk her own life for it, she might not understand how her death effected others too. She didn't say it, because it wasn't really Star who Ellesandra would be saying that too. It wasn't really Star that she was thinking it about. The grief bubbled up, enough that she'd been distracted to the point of not expecting Star's touch. The embrace caused her to jump, both physically and emotionally surprised at the touch. The calmness wasn't welcome right now and she pulled away, moving to stand as if she had been planning to do that the entire time and lightly pulling Star's hands off of her even in that quick squeeze. She took a few steps away and then stopped, unsure what to say. She was being dramatic, wasn't she? Shame, but she really didn't like how her emotions went haywire when around Star. And how when Star touched her, she was afraid Star would be able to see the memories associated with those emotions. Without a word, she returned to her stump, hiding behind her 'duty' again, and looking anywhere around them except at Star herself. She withheld the tears that were on the verge of springing to her eyes, but at the same time she knew that didn't matter with Star. Star would see the grief anyways, and that angered her. She couldn't even hide the emotions from the woman like she could everyone else, to get them to think she was just being moody and leave her alone.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Indeed, Star had to find a balance between respecting Ellesandra's boundaries and not allowing the obvious grief and anguish to go unanswered. That mountain was looking a whole lot more existent right now. She had been given a clear signal by them pulling away, but something...Beckoned Star to keep at it. She was confident Ellesandra wasn't going to hurt her, of course. She worried about losing their allyship, but...If she was willing to risk her own life for a stranger, she was willing to do at least as much for someone she had come to care about as a friend. So she followed to the stump. She sat, cross-legged, in front of Ellesandra, looking up at them. She didn't say anything for the moment. She just looked at them. Of course, Ellesandra knew that her looking at someone was almost always her looking at them.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra hadn't expected Star to follow her. Her lips pressed together in a firm line, frustration and irritation at Star's silent insistence. She knew Star wasn't just looking at her, was waiting for her to open up, or to be able to see and understand more about her emotions. "Stop it." The thought of Star staring at the emotions that she didn't even want to feel right now bothered her - a lot. Her feet came up to rest on the edge of the stump and her knees pressed to her chest, as if somehow putting her legs between herself and Star would prevent Star from seeing into her as well. It was ridiculous, but the instinct to protect and cover herself was still there. She felt naked, exposed beneath Star's gaze and it was not something she was comfortable with right now. "I'm not going to talk about it, either." She added this, knowing that even if Star looked away, she might try to bring the topic up. Ellesandra found she still couldn't actually look down and meet Star's gaze. Instead, she held onto her knees and looked out over the field, the grief slowly being pushed down by the irritation and anger. Okay, maybe Star pushing it was good; it helped her focus on those emotions rather than the grief.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
"I'm not asking you to talk about the mountain that isn't there," she said, undeterred by Ellesandra's emotional response. "I just want to talk to you. I was enjoying that," she said, her words as honest-to-a-fault as ever. "If you insist that I leave you be I will but not until you listen to me." There was a firmness to her voice, one that spoke of emotional conviction. But she was still being gentle. She didn't want to actively anger the woman of course. But some emotional grit was to be expected with such a sensitive topic. "You decided to help me. You saved me from coming out of that a lot worse than I would have. Maybe even saved my life if things went terribly wrong. You stuck by me, and each time I was ready to let go of you, to not impose on you, you stayed beside me. Despite both of us knowing the dangers we were up against, you even stood by me as I pledged to help a man who was at the time a total stranger to us both. And from the moment I laid eyes on you I have seen..." She paused. "...You know what I've seen. And I'm still not going to press you on that, as much as it makes my heart bleed to pretend I don't see it. I know I don't afford the privacy of emotion that many are used to. I know it's hard to know someone sees it. But it's just as hard to be someone who sees someone so kind suffer. And before you try to hide behind some sort of honour that forces you to be the way you are, just...Remember what I see. Remember that I see through lies of even adept liars and...As kind as I can possibly say it, you're not a very good liar," she said, offering a smile at that. Her words might have conviction to them, but she did her best to remain gentle. "So I'm...Not asking you to confide in me, not asking you to spill secrets to me. I'm just asking you to...Hear me when I tell you it's hard to fight against every fiber of my heart that begs me to see what's right in front me, but I do it because you asked me to. But I have to draw the line, Ellesandra. When it gets to be too much, I...Don't need you to open up about it. I just want to be able to support you. We can talk about anything else, if it helps. Because it just...Isn't fair that you can be there for me, constantly, when I need you, which has been far more times in one day than I care to admit...And I'm not allowed to do anything at all for you in return. You went and stepped into my life and now you've got me caring about you. And if I'm willing to risk my life for a stranger, just imagine what I'll do for a friend, let alone one who saved my life." She looked at Ellesandra, pleading with her eyes. "...Just let me be here with you and talk about...Birds, or flowers...Anything."

Ellesandra 
// On a phone call, will be a minute

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// No rush!

Ellesandra 
// I've returned, sorry about that

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// All is well!

Ellesandra 
She frowned. The mountain wasn't there, but Star kept mentioning it. To be fair, Ellesandra mentioned it just a few moments ago, too. With a deep breath, she put her chin on the top of her knees and closed her eyes, hearing the firmness of Star's voice. She wouldn't give this up, and pushing back would either start an argument or Ellesandra would have to simply walk away. And if she walked away, what would happen to Star? She wouldn't be able to live with herself if something happened to the mage that Ellesandra could have stopped, but she just walked away because being in Star's presence was hard. The dream came back to her and irritation rose in her once again. It took a few moments, and honestly with the words that Star cared about her making it easier, Ellesandra calmed herself down. She resigned herself to having to deal with Star knowing that she hurt, but she didn't need to know why. "Fine. You can see it, but the topic is off limits. That is a firm boundary, Mi-...Star. You will not pry, or try to trick me into talking about things that I have no desire to relive or discuss." She opened her eyes, looking back down to Star. These weren't requests. They were clear statements that if Star didn't think she could follow, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could travel alongside the mage. Regret and fear came up at that, worried that Star would refuse and Ellesandra might be forced to face the dream she'd had again. The guilt at someone dying because of her inaction. "And give me the handkerchief back, if you're done with it." Ellesandra hadn't forgotten it. She didn't care if Star's tears or even snot was on it; she'd clean it the next opportunity she had, but she didn't want to let Star just keep it for now. Especially not with the tension between them and the current irritation at Ellesandra feeling like that mountain, which she always pretended wasn't there, kept getting poked by Star's comments, brought back to life, and Ellesandra was not prepared for the emotional onslaught that would be once she stopped repressing it entirely.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star blinked, looking at her hand to find she was holding onto it. "Oh, erm...S-Sorry. I meant to give it back," she said, handing it back. It only had two tiny tear spots on it which were mostly dry. She heard the 'Mi', and upon handing the handkerchief back, was reminded of the initials. Was she...Being associated with someone from Ellesandra's past? She couldn't know. And she wouldn't ask. "Ellesandra...I said right when we got onto the road together that I wasn't going to press you on this. Do I...Want to know? Of course. But I'm not going to force you. Being who I am, I've had to learn when it is appropriate to...Make use of the knowledge I have from the power. I'm not perfect of course but...I at least have tact enough that if someone says they don't want to talk about something...All I can do is just say...I'm here, if they change their mind. And that I do want to help. But that's all I can do. And I would hope it had gone without saying but...I'll say it so you can hear it: I'm not going to trick you. I'm not going to mislead you, lie to you, intentionally lead you along some conversation path hoping you'll slip and tell me something you don't want to talk about..." She shook her head. "If you ever, ever feel comfortable talking about whatever it is...I want it to be genuine. I want it to be only because you want to share with me, and no other reason. It would make feel sick if you ever felt I was...Manipulating you. I told you I...Only ever will be honest with you. Even if the truth isn't pleasant, or what you want to hear. It will always be the truth, and I will always hold the best intentions towards you. I swear this, all of it."

Ellesandra 
She took the handkerchief back. A second was taken, running her thumb across the initials, before she folded it up neatly and slipped it back into her pocket. The grief and guilt, so intertwined, threatened to rise again. They were pushed down and she folded the handkerchief up, putting it back in her pocket and moving to sit up right on the stump again, feet on the ground once more. "Good." It was the only thing Star would get in response to all of her confirmation and reassurance that she wouldn't pry. That she wouldn't try to manipulate or trick information out of Ellesandra. Ellesandra was uncomfortable with Star being able to see her emotions, but there wasn't anything she could do about that. Setting this boundary, verbally and getting agreement on it rather than just assuming Star was too good of a person to push on it, was important for her. She looked down at Star for a moment, then stood. "Lets continue walking." She needed to get away from where they just were, where she'd felt so raw there for a moment. Whether or not Star followed, Ellesandra moved back onto the path and began just walking alongside the meadow, not necessarily leaving it but not going to lay back down in the flowers, either. Movement felt needed, to help process and distract herself, so that's what she was doing. "So, recap our next destination and travel plans for me, assuming you are fully recovered tomorrow and good to start the journey?"

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star loosed a soft breath, glad that they reached an agreement. She obviously could tell there was more pain lingering, but all she asked was that they keep together and not fall silent. She got at least that much, made clear as they got up. She joined them, walking alongside. The question had her recounting the details. "I'll be having Morrun mark my map with where we'll be going. It'll be about two days of walking north, hopefully without any major issues. From there, we need to find details, clues. Find some information about these people Morrun said he saw, who come from Myst. Or in general just...Get to Myst, however we can. From Myst, he believes we can get to my home again. Once we're in my home...There will be a lot of work to do to find out what happened, starting with the...Ruins of what was once my home."

Ellesandra 
"Ruins of what it once was? What happened to it?" Ellesandra led them on a path that seemed to run alongside this meadow for a while, but when they got to the end of it, she turned around and began walking back down it. The meadow was beautiful, and Star had obviously enjoyed it, so she didn't want to just walk away and prevent the feel of the nature and the environment from being enjoyed. She needed to move, but no reason it couldn't just be along this path. A glance was given over to Star at the question, but she didn't push. Just like she'd requested of Star, if that type of information was painful for her or she didn't want to discuss it, who was Ellesandra to push on it?

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Unlike Ellesandra, Star was an open book to her companion. She wore a smile, but it was...A sorrowful one. "It's how I got separated from my mother in the first place. We were attacked. My mother was known in our region as a powerful magic user, and I was a little too young at the time to really understand it all, but...I think it's fair to say that she attracted some powerful enemies. My mother ran with me, we tried to escape as the other magi held off the attack. But they pursued. Laid waste. Razed our village. I remember flames and blood falling from the sky." She paused here, looking over the beauty of the natural land as she kept walking with her companion. "I remember seeing the fear in my mother, in her aura. She was the strongest, so...She had to fight. But she also had to guard me. The choice of being idle and protecting me, or going out and saving anyone she could from our village. Those are the conflicting emotions I remember seeing in her. I told her to send me away, for her enemies did not know she bore a daughter. It was the only way she could protect me, for if she fought and died, or the enemy retreated with knowledge of me, I would always be in danger from them." She closed her eyes for a moment, holding down her sorrow. Then opened them again. "So she did. She opened a gate and sent me through it. It was a plan made in the moment. She sent me far, far away, and I had...Hoped she would be able to follow me afterwards." Her voice was starting to get a bit stiff, a bit choked. "But a day turned into a week, which turned into a month, then two, then six, then a year, two, five, ten..." She shuddered, closing her eyes tight. Tears streaked down her cheeks. "I don't want her to be dead, Ellesandra...I don't. I don't want her to have died fighting for us all. I don't want to have to regret not begging her to come with me, even knowing the evils would have followed her." She choked a sob. "...So please do not warn me of what I already know...That the enemy may be waiting for me there. I need to do this. With all that I am, I need to return to her side. And I need to pray with all that I am that she still lives..."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had not expected all of...that. When she'd heard the first choking noise, she stopped, turning to look at Star. Regret filled her, at asking this question and making Star relive this. She shouldn't have, and as she saw how much it effected Star, she couldn't help but try to fix it. The thing is, she didn't know how to. She looked around, as if suddenly, magically, someone else would appear to comfort Star. To say the right thing, and make her feel better. She'd never been good at this, not even before the mountain was there. Looking back to Star she wavered for a moment, and then stepped forward. She had her barrier in place, to try her best to block the sorrow that was evident in Star's face from hitting her at the touch, but she would offer her arms for Star if she wanted the hug. She did not touch Star first, though. She made the offer and indication apparent, arms spread and ready to wrap around Star if she decided to lean into the embrace, but she knew enough about Star's ability by now that she wouldn't touch Star without her permission in this situation. It may not be an emotion Star wanted to share, and even if Ellesandra was guarding against it, with something this strong could she not feel it at all? Her face was conflicted, and there was definite hesitation in the offer, but if Star needed a shoulder to cry on, Ellesandra would be it. "I won't warn you." Ellesandra said, even though she had thought that. "No matter what is waiting there or not, we will find it and see what happened to your mother." If Star did accept the embrace, she would wrap her arms around the mage and guide her head onto her shoulder, lightly squeezing. Awkward, but still supportive.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Ellesandra might be the sort to be hesitant to physical touch, but Star was the complete opposite. The moment a hug was offered, she went flush against them, the comfort evident as her aura connected to Ellesandra. The raw sorrow was there. But it was an emotion Ellesandra could know was not their own. Putting up a barrier kept some of it out, but it was too powerful to avoid the sensation entirely. It did not evoke sadness in Ellesandra specifically. But just with all the other emotions, it was there, able to be reached out to. It was quite like seeing Star cry, except it was Ellesandra's heart, the core of their emotion, 'seeing' Star's sadness. It was a visceral feeling. If Ellesandra cared about Star, then genuine sorrow was a natural consequence. Nobody liked to see someone they cared about sad, and this connection only amplified that. Of course...Not everyone reacted the same way to sorrows. Perhaps, instead, that raw sadness would evoke...Protectiveness. Anger, at the ones who caused this sorrow. Or perhaps even courage, to stand up against the sorrow and be the devout rock that supported Star. Her power was not manipulative. It simply...Connected their hearts together. With happiness, it was often infectious. With the tranquility of her aura, it simply spread through the other. But there was much less tranquility to find in this moment. Her sadness, even with the guards held, was...Intense. A sorrow that ripped her apart inside, enough to overcome her and leave her shaking. Yet, Ellesandra could feel the way that the hug gave Star comfort. Without a word, it was communicated how the knight's embrace was like a dam against the tsunami. Star managed to wrangle her emotion enough to keep her sobs minimal, and it would be something that Ellesandra would be able to glean insight into as she did so. To be able to see that Star felt far, far greater sadness than she showed on the surface, if Ellesandra allowed themselves to look, even briefly, into her heart. It stood to reason that an empath was in great control of their own emotions, and yet the sadness was potent enough to cut her to her core; she certainly would and did cry over lesser things, but this sadness was, in many ways, similar to what Ellesandra faced. A feeling that overpowered her. That coursed through her very soul. A shackle that held her. Paralyzed her. As Ellesandra held the weight of a fallen princess upon their shoulders, Star was burdened by the weight of the unknown fate of her own mother. Yet, she did not feel an ounce of anger, or regret, or any negative feeling towards Ellesandra. She did willingly share her story, the context of her adventure. Where the knight felt they had overstepped, Star held a small, thin thread of...Relief? Yes, the pain was deep. But she was able to express it, and there in Ellesandra's arms, the edge grew duller. The icy cage around her heart melted, just a little. Each moment Ellesandra held her, her heat managed to beat just a little warmer under the grips of this terrible memory. Star dare not take more than she was given, but...There was a clear, obvious desire to remain close to the knight. And if the stalwart knight did hold her long enough, it would allow Star to again find her center and level her breathing as sorrow slowly...Slowly, but surely...Gave way to gratitude, and a deepened bond with the woman who held her.

// Last post from me tonight, have to be going, and won't be around the next two days unfortunately! Take care!"

Ellesandra 
// Oh, okay! Have a good evening!

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Good morning! Here to resume today if/when you are!

Ellesandra 
// Good morning! It'll be like an hour or so before I can but would love to!

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Sounds good, no rush as always. Will be around until about 4pm est.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra took in a deep breath at the sorrow that she felt through the embrace as soon as it happened. Even through her emotional wall, she could feel how sad this memory and what happened made Star. It felt extremely odd, seeing this, and she wondered if that was how Star experienced Ellesandra's emotions when she looked at her. Ellesandra did feel that protectiveness come up, the desire to ensure that Star didn't feel this way again - to protect her from the feeling that she was trying so hard to protect herself from, too. Anger wasn't a big part of it, only a bit of anger at whoever did this but it was so background it likely wouldn't be noticed. Ellesandra slowly let her arms fully encircle Star and just held her, eventually reaching up and running a hand through the back of Star's hair. The desire to protect this woman was almost overwhelming, wanting to just squeeze the sadness right out of her and make her happy and jumping into the meadow again. Of course, Ellesandra couldn't do that - and wouldn't try. If anyone looked their way she gave them icy glares to ensure they kept to themselves and didn't interrupt as Star let out her sorrow. She didn't say anything, no soothing words or reassurances that most people would provide in this situation. She just held Star, letting her cry it out. Her own sorrow twinged in response to how much she'd seen and felt in Star, and how holding Star reminded her of holding Marigold, but she pushed it down. Unlike Star's sorrow where she couldn't just squeeze it out of the woman, she COULD just push her own sorrow down. And that totally got rid of it, right?

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The hold that Star gave to Ellesandra was tight. What Star showed outwardly was not representative of the depths of this sorrow, that much Ellesandra would certainly feel. It ran deeper than choked sobs, tears, and needing a hug. It was the sort of sorrow that led the typical person to nightmares, to dangerous thoughts, to all the dangers of deep, all-consuming sadness. Guilt, as well, was significant and present. It wouldn't be hard to figure out why - Star likely felt personally responsible for all of this, whether it was true or not. Nobody bothered the two of them. If anyone saw it, they steered clear. Such was the polite thing to do, after all. Despite the darkness Star felt within her, she remained an empath. A master over emotion. So it wasn't long before she managed to subdue her sobs, regulate her breathing, and find a calmer place. Her hair which Ellesandra brushed their fingers through was...Remarkably soft. Silken threads of snowy white, pure and untainted by dirt or oils that would make the threads heavy or rough. "...Thank you," Star whispered from her place still holding Ellesandra, head against their shoulder. "I know you aren't the biggest fan of touching, because of what happens when we do. But it feels...Nice...To be held by you. I feel safe with you."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra almost jumped when Star finally spoke. It had been obvious she'd been slowly bringing herself back together, but the whispering had surprised her. She squeezed tighter for a moment as Star spoke, and she had been just about to release Star, hold slackening and her body moving to let go, when she heard Star said that she felt safe with her. There was a pause where it felt like her own heart had sunk into her chest, words that had no ill intention whatsoever but obviously had a pretty severe impact on Ellesandra. She squeezed once more then stepped away, releasing Star and looking away from her. Her own eyes were misty now, and it had nothing to do with the sorrow she'd felt in her companion. Her jaw clenched and she reached for the handkerchief again, handing it over to Star for her now splotchy nose and eyes. She pressed it into Star's hand, if Star tried to refuse it. "Why don't we sit? Take some time to recover before you go back to Morrun's. He'll get the wrong idea if you come back looking like you're heartbroken." Star had been right. She hadn't liked the touching, and especially not when Star had said the last words she'd heard from Marigold. It took a lot of willpower to close up that wound again, looking away from Star who, while looking nothing like Marigold, reminded Ellesandra so much of her. Ellesandra couldn't continue to hold Star and risk her being able to get a better look into that emotion. She had mentioned before that for particularly powerful ones, she could sometimes see the memories associated with it - and THAT was not something Ellesandra was ready to share, verbally or otherwise. There was real fear on display in Ellesandra right now, fear that Star would be able to see straight through everything she was trying to pretend didn't happen. Everything that she refused to accept, in one way or another. Through that mountain that didn't exist. Without a word, Ellesandra made her way over to one of the benches alongside the meadow, sitting on the very far edge of it to give Star plenty of room without touching.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star did initially try to refuse the handkerchief. It being pressed firmly into her hand did force her to take it, though...She still didn't use it. She let her tears fall. They had slowed. But the odd sniffle and tear did still pass. She nodded lightly to Ellesandra, confused why the woman was so pained. Was it something she said? It must have been, but...She promised she wouldn't pry, and she would hold to that. The most she could do would assure Ellesandra she was present, that she was here for them, but she sincerely doubted Ellesandra had any major change of heart on the matter in the handful of minutes since Star had asserted that she wanted to know, but wouldn't press. So she moved to the bench, sitting next to but not touching Ellesandra. The bench looked over a clear pond of fresh water. Likely one of the main water sources for the grove. Star continued to not use the handkerchief. She instead just looked at it, brushing her thumb over the soft fabric. Obviously, the object didn't have any emotions for her to read, but her curiosity about it was clear. Despite that, she didn't ask about it or say a word about the clear mist she observed in the eyes of her companion, nor the strong emotions she observed in general. She was there if they wanted to talk but...She assumed they didn't. So she just spoke up about something else, as a way of reaffirming her promise to not force Ellesandra to speak about these things. "...Have you always trained with a rapier? Most knights I have met use longswords and shields. Not one to go with the popular choice, huh?" she put on a forced smile. She didn't even look at Ellesandra. Just kept looking at the embroidered cloth in her hands. The topic was random, of course. Just the first thing she could think to speak about that wasn't emotional. Something that let Ellesandra save face.

Ellesandra 
She glanced over at Star, who appeared to just be examining the handkerchief. There was confusion as to why she wasn't using it; a frown crossing her face and looking up at Star's own face, before she shrugged it off and turned to look out over the lake. The question wasn't personal, at least on the surface. It was one Ellesandra thought she could answer, and still walk around the point that she didn't want to talk about. Her gaze ran along the water, silent for a few moments while planning out her response, not just speaking her mind immediately. Focusing on this task helped distract her, so even if Star hadn't intended it as a way to help, it was. "I did use spear and shield, for most of the time growing up. Eventually I dropped the shield as I became more talented with my magic; I needed a hand free to weave spells, but would keep the shield on my back for use between situations where I'd need it. I trained one of my charges with the rapier, though. She wanted to learn something that she could carry with her without it making her look...manly, she called it. Or improper. We talked about daggers that she could hide, but she wanted a weapon she could actually engage in sparring with, so we settled on a rapier." Ellesandra looked up at the clear sky, remembering that day with a wistful, sad smile. "I'm ambidextrous and she was left handed, so I taught her with my left hand so it was fairer for her to learn, easier for her to watch and emulate than if I used my right hand. In a later fight, I got wounded in my right arm pretty badly, and wasn't close to a healer to have them help repair it. Not to mention my particular, unique abilities make healing and restoration spells not as effective on me; a double edged sword, being particularly resistant to magic." The wistful smile had dropped from her face and she looked down to the lake, sighing. "I can use my right arm fine, but if I were to try to use it in a real fight, against anyone who had any strength or skill, it would be a liability. It doesn't do well with anything strenuous or heavy. So I picked up the rapier for myself in my left hand and use my right hand for my spells."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Had Star intended for it to be therapeutic? No real tell gave it away in her demeanour, but given how in tune she was with emotion, it would hardly be surprising if it was the truth. Being able to know just what to say to people seemed to be a somewhat consistent talent of hers, from what evidence had been shown in their time together thus far. She wore a more genuine smile as the explanation passed. "Resistant to magic? Must just be the arcane sort. I've felt no resistance to mine, though...Mine is rather unique, so I can't say it's too surprising. We'll have to see how well I can heal those wounds on your legs. It'll be important to know how effective my healing will be on you." She spoke forward, looking out at the water for a time, then back at the handkerchief. She smiled after a few moments of silence, presumably from something running around in her own mind. "I can only imagine the sight of you training someone. Or even a class of people. You have a...Presence about you. A conviction in your words that I think makes it easy for people to trust that you're being sincere." She seemed to be mostly thinking aloud with these words, as a question then followed: "Did you want to be a knight? You don't have to answer if it's too personal of course. I'm just...Curious about what small Ellesandra was like, and what eventually had you turning to a life of wandering. I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that somewhere in that life story are things that we aren't gonna talk about so...If it helps, leave whatever blanks are necessary. Unless you'd rather just not answer."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra shrugged at the resistant comment. The only spell, per say, that Star had cast that effected her was one that she hadn't needed anyways, and her absorption of it had been similar to the intended effect as it was. Star's more passive abilities, to see her emotions and share them via touch, weren't entirely the same. At least, that's why Ellesandra assumed they weren't the same thing; she certainly wasn't a magical scholar. The thought of her training a class of people made her shake her head, though. "A class of students would drive me crazy." Ellesandra liked structure, and too many students didn't. She wouldn't last for a week as a teacher to more than just one or two where she could tolerate and be patient with the sudden changes. "As for being a knight, it depends on the timeframe. I -" There was a pause, a mixture of relief, gratitude, and that grief rising back up to the surface again. "I was an orphan, so being a knight wasn't something I ever really considered, for a long time. When I was taken in, I wanted to help the family that did so. Being a knight just...lined up with how I could do that, and what I was good at." She shrugged, not moving on to how she turned to a life of wandering. That bit alone had already gotten closer to the mountain than Ellesandra was truly comfortable with, as evident by her left hand turning into a fist on her own thigh and her eyes turning away from Star. She didn't know why she fought so hard to prevent Star from seeing her tear up; Star could SEE the emotion, but it didn't matter. And like always, Ellesandra didn't let the grief or sorrow overwhelm and take hold of her. It was pushed back down. "Do what you're good at, right? That's how you make a life in the world. Find something you're good at and don't hate, and get people to pay you to do it."

Ellesandra 
// Gonna be an hour, work meeting

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
It was natural for Star to look at others, even if not just for the politeness of giving someone one's attention while they spoke. She didn't stare at them, didn't study them like she often did, however. She was trying to give Ellesandra a little space in that regard, though that she could see the strong force of guilt and sorrow that welled in them. She was tempted to reach out and comfort them by placing a hand on their shoulder, but...She had perceived in them that they didn't like her touch quite so much, given the effects that carried with it. It hurt. It hurt to know that something she relied on, something she wanted to do, to offer physical comfort, was unwanted. But she kept that hurt down, and managed to mask it in a way that wasn't typical for her. Ellesandra didn't have the same advantage as her, of course. It wasn't that she couldn't understand the hesitation. The desire to retain privacy. And it didn't matter that Star had the absolute best, brightest, most pure intentions. If Ellesandra didn't want to accept her desire to be closer, she had no choice but to respect that. And she would, even if she struggled to see someone in pain and not do anything about it. The thought of it, let alone actually doing it, tore her heart to shreds. So it was, her genuine smile that she had been wearing faded as she nodded to Ellesandra's words. A little more forced. A little more of a mask. For someone as expressive as Star, it wasn't hard to tell the difference. Others might not be able to see her emotions clearly, but she certainly didn't make it terribly challenging to read her like a book most of the time. She was trying to put on a smile for the knight, even if her heart felt like it was in a vice. "You're certainly good at helping people," she said, her voice a bit quieter now. She'd stopped crying and sniffling. Now it was just a...Looming cloud over her. A sorrow that clung to her and had not yet healed. "I'm sorry you had such suffering in your early years. I do hope you were brought in early in life...And that those who did take you in were loving and kind to you." Words, sincere as could be, spoken from a woman who, at some unknown young age, had been forced to fend for herself, based on the story she told.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra shrugged, latching onto the comment about suffering in early years. Thinking about that was easier than thinking about why she became a wandering knight, about everything surrounding it. "Nothing to be sorry for. I don't remember any of it. I think I was found when I was three? Four? They don't quite know how old I was, exactly, but too young to remember much from before that. As such, the day they found me was assigned as the anniversary of my birth, for future celebrations and such." A brief smile creased her face, thinking about a few of those, before she shook her head. "And they were more than kind to me." Up until the end, but Ellesandra didn't say that part. Taking a deep breath, she shook her head. "Why is it that you can pull emotions out of me that I haven't let myself experience in three years?" Three years, since it happened. She eyed Star a little suspiciously, as if somehow her magic was at fault for allowing her to just reach in and pluck them out. Straight past all of her guards and barriers. It was unfair, and that was just one of the reasons she wasn't comfortable with Star touching her. Considering that Star had no intention of using the handkerchief, as made obvious by her still just holding it, Ellesandra reached over for it again. She had no intention of offering it once more, with Star's refusal to put it to use. "I think we've been emotional enough for the day. What's next on the agenda, Miss-...Star?" This was Ellesandra trying her best to be polite in saying she wanted, no, needed the topic to change if they were going to talk. And move onto something lighter, something not herself preferably.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star smiled, genuinely again, hearing that those who took Ellesandra in were kind to her. Good parents. Yes. That was good. That was comforting, though some strange emotion flashed in Ellesandra with those words that Star couldn't place. Still...She didn't pry. She offered the handkerchief back when the knight reached for it. She smiled again at the perhaps rhetorical question. "...Emotion is what has defined my life. The connections that we form, one person to another. The best and worst things that come with being human. It's...Far easier to explore emotion, and far easier to speak about things you might not otherwise do, when you know the person you are with sincerely cares about it all." She looked at Ellesandra and flashed another smile, then looked back out at the water. "The longer you stay around me, the more I'm sure you'll get used to seeing me be emotional. I...Admit I can get worked up over small things at times. I'm still not perfect at controlling my own emotions, after all," she said with a quiet giggle. "I don't have anything in mind, Ellesandra. We're resting on your insistence, after all. So I'm content to just...Enjoy the sights. Be with you, and be calm for now. I admit I've been thinking about the state of affairs in Cloverport. Wondering if there was maybe some way that we could have returned peace to that place. But before you go chiding me...I know there are things even I can't hope to achieve on my own. And after the stunt we pulled I don't see any diplomatic options for getting rid of the pirates. I can only hope that that works itself out, somehow, I suppose."

Ellesandra 
She didn't know how to respond to the idea of Star sincerely caring about her, and how she was feeling. It made her a little uncomfortable in that she wasn't sure she wanted someone to get close like that, to actually care for her and poke at things she'd rather leave buried. It seemed Star had agreed not to poke, though, so that was good. "Worked up over small things, like blueberries?" There was a wry tone of amusement in Ellesandra's words and emotions, remembering how Star had teared up and cried a little when Ellesandra had shared her blueberries with her. There wasn't judgment, though. It had been confusion and concern, and now amusement, at how easily Star had teared up over the blueberries. There was no judgment or demeaning attitude towards the fact that Star had shown emotions that easily, though. She spread open the handkerchief in front of her, fingers tracing the embroidered letters, M.K. "I'm not sure what we could have done for the citizens of Cloverport. Honestly, we likely made things worse. That, or they will think we will bring reinforcements and they'll leave. We can hope for that option, but the more likely thing is that they find the dead pirates, both that escorted their supposed elven captive as well as the ones out on the road that attacked you, and they'll take it out on the citizens." She flipped the handkerchief over, idly playing with the thread on it, before lightly folding it up into a neat little triangle. "We could go back and try to do something stealthily, but our options there are limited. Cutting off the head of their group would only bring another captain in their place, and maybe lash out at the village. Burn a ship, that makes it even less likely they leave and they might burn the town. People like that tend to give as good as they get. If you want to help them, then I'd suggest we just share the news of what happened and request the aid of those with enough soldiers to stamp them out in one blow. That way, we don't even have to stop our journey, either." The handkerchief was placed back in her pocket. Out of sight, out of mind; but always carried.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star blushed, but smiled at the mention of blueberries. She giggled. "...Nobody ever really paid much attention to that. And I...What can I say? I appreciate small gestures. You can tell a lot about someone by little thoughtful acts like that," she said, smiling back at the knight while idly kicking her legs. She then listened to the knight speak about the other options, and she paused for a moment, then looked around them. She was getting an idea. Perhaps a dangerous prospect, given her track record. "...I think you're right," she said, looking back at Ellesandra. "I think the elves here will want to know what those pirates did to one of their own. And I think it might be prudent to suggest that they oust those pirates by force, and establish better ties with the governing force in Cloverport. The two settlements are close enough, and the other city being a port means there'd be a lot of opportunity for trade," she said, smiling. "We should see if we can find someone of some authority. Perhaps Morrun would know where to direct us?"

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra watched Star with an eyebrow raised. "You...are a meddler, aren't you?" Like her previous comment about the blueberries, there was no judgment or indication that this was a negative thing. Instead, she was just amused by it, though she did note that this would likely mean a harder job for her in the future, what with making sure Star was safe and all. Sighing, she moved to stand, nodding to what Star was saying. "Then yes, Morrun did offer to introduce us to the leader already didn't he? We can set up a meeting if possible and go from there." She took a moment, stretching her arms up, and then leaning her torso back with her hands on the back of her hips. Stretches in each direction before she cracked her neck and turned back to Star. Her emotions from earlier had all been put back in their spot, feeling much more like herself - well, her current self. She did eye Star's still blotchy face from the sobbing, but didn't comment on it. If Morrun had something to say about it, she would follow Star's lead on it. Star didn't seem the type to hide why she'd cried, but Ellesandra wouldn't volunteer that information if Star didn't first.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star wore a proud, cheery, playful smile upon being called a meddler. A badge of honour, it seemed, rather than something to be ashamed about. "Only where there is evil to be meddled with," she said with a more selfsame chipper, singsong-y cadence to her voice. She rubbed at her eyes, but didn't seem to be too worried about anyone commenting on it. Or if she was, she didn't show it. Off they went, back to Morrun's place. It was growing a bit later in the day. Sunset would be upon them in an hour or two. When they arrived, Lissana showed a bit of concern upon seeing Star. "Oh, Star, Ellesandra. Is everything all right?" asked the elven woman. Star nodded. "Of course, all is well. Just an emotional chat brought on by discussing our next steps," replied Star. Honest, as ever. That seemed to be enough to satisfy the question. Morrun was at the dining table, halfway through eating a muffin. He swallowed and nodded to the two entering. Star began by holding out a hand. The coin pouch that Ellesandra had given her, the one they definitely took their pay out of, appeared in her hand with a subtle glow of light that rose from her palm. As she had said, it was her intent to return it to Morrun, unless Ellesandra stopped her.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra followed along, walking just a pace behind Star and to the side, like most bodyguards would. A single diagonal step needed to cover Star, but giving enough personal distance that Star wouldn't feel crowded - or Ellesandra crowded by Star - and give the illusion to Star, if she wished for it, to forget that Ellesandra was there. When they arrived back to Morrun's place, Lissana's concern wasn't unsurprising. Ellesandra looked much better than Star of course, since she'd only teared up and hadn't let herself actually let go and cry. As they entered and Star went straight to returning the money to Morrun, Ellesandra just gave Morrun a sheepish smile. "Should have waited until we left to give it to her, hmm?" She commented, a minor scold to herself but not actually upset at the turn of events. She'd expected it as soon as Star had mentioned it, though there was a curious gaze given to Star's sleeve. Was there some sort of magical storage in there somewhere? She hadn't seen or felt the bag of coins the entire time they were at the meadows. Still, Ellesandra made no move to stop the return of the coin which she had definitely taken her pay out of. Crossing her arms, she moved to stand by the door to the kitchen, taking up a standard guards spot. This may be Morrun's house and there not be anything to guard against, but it was a comfort thing. She was used to finding a spot where she could see the exits and be close to her charge; not doing so was a sign of Ellesandra truly relaxing, and a level of trust that not even Star had fully earned yet.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Morrun gave Ellesandra a chiding look. A look that said wordlessly that she went and screwed it up, all done with a smile on his lips. "We took our pay out of it, so you can keep the rest," said Star as she set the coins down for the elven man. The heavy thud the bag made had him instinctively knitting his brow. He went to inspect the bag, estimating the coins. He didn't seem pleased. "...What, did each of you take like, two coins?" sighed Morrun. "Honestly. I can't accept this," he said, looking at Star and Ellesandra. "You two barely took anything, as much is obvious," he continued, which now invited Lissana to share in the disapproving stares, threatening as a squirrel with her frown and cute pink apron. Star paused. "...Well, I took five coins. Fifty gold can be made to last a long while. So..." She then turned, slowly, to look at Ellesandra. "...How many did you take, then, Ellesandra?"

Ellesandra 
// FUCKING A lmao

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Teehee~

Ellesandra 
Oh, Ellesandra had just fallen into a trap, hadn't she? The slow turn and look from Star made Ellesandra grit her teeth, narrowing her eyes at the mage. Had she planned this? She'd said she could tell when people lied - even implied that she knew Ellesandra hadn't really taken her pay out of the bag earlier. But to set her up for that right in front of Morrun and Lissana was just - well, devious. Ellesandra crossed her arms and held a stoic, nonplussed look on her face as she met Star's gaze. "I paid for my room at the Inn last night, and took ten platinum. And then I decided I would donate ten platinum back to our group fund for our journey, since we'll be sharing time together on the road and supplies and such, anyways." It was a total lie, and ended up to her only taking enough to pay for her room anyways. The thing is, Ellesandra knew Star could tell. And she was meeting Star's gaze in a challenge, the amusement at the situation rising. She wondered how far fetched she could get with her explanations before Star would call her on it in front of people; would she do so now, or would she let it slide? There was a little bit of humor showing, and an interest to see how much she could push Star before she was just straight up called on her bullshit.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
"Oh, that's a wonderful explanation, if I was a five year old that didn't understand how math works," said Star back with a similar amusement on her voice and posture. "Well in that case, I should explain that I took all of the money, but then donated it to you so you could donate it back to me so I could donate it back to Morrun. If you follow that logic, I think that means both of us got paid twice. Really, Morrun, you have no business being so generous to both of us," she said, briefly turning to the elven man for effect. No, it seemed Star had zero qualms in calling out the lie right then and there. She sighed. She could recognize that she hadn't taken all the money herself either. "Honestly. When we were first walking to Cloverport you talked about me hiring you. If I knew hiring your services cost a grand total of what...One gold per day, I could have hired you for a few months on that salary without issue. But I think we can all agree a knight's escort is worth at least a little more than that, can't we?"

Ellesandra 
Star took the excuse further and it got an honest, surprised laugh out of Ellesandra. She tilted her head back out belted out an amused chuckle, one she hadn't really made in so long she herself was surprised that it had come out. She cleared her throat, taking on the stoic look again, but this time looking to Morrun. "Did you hear that? You're quite generous, paying us twice." And then she looked back to Star. She tightened her arms around her own chest in her crossed arms position, shaking her head at her. "I'm sorry, you seem to be under the impression that the client gets to decide what the cost of my services is. No, my services are valued by myself. And I will sell my services for what I think is appropriate, which may change from one job to another." Her eyebrows raised, challenging Star to disagree. "Or do you not think that I am fully capable of recognizing the worth of my work? And what is appropriate to charge? I have been doing this job for three years, after all, and even longer beforehand in a longterm contract. I like to think I know what I'm worth." She knew she was lowkey arguing that her worth was less than Star was implying, but she also knew that it was up to her to charge what she wanted, not up to Star to decide what she should be paid. And she'd draw that boundary clearly. "If you can't afford me, well. Then I guess that's your loss." She said, feeling amusement at the mock bickering they had right now.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Morrun and Lissana exchanged glances. The more these two observed Star and Ellesandra, the less they understood them. Not sleeping in the same bed, not even the same house, but... "They argue just like we do, dear," said Morrun to his wife, evoking a giggle. Star seemed to miss this comment as she fired back at Ellesandra. "Yeah? Well it might just be the clearest evidence I have no business being a pirate, because I sure do know when I'm stealing something!" she said, hands on her hips and a smile on her face as she leaned slightly towards the knight. "So be honest then, gallant knight! Let's negotiate a price, right here, right now! I anticipate the journey I'm undertaking will take upwards of a year. So I'm sure within that time frame I will have secured enough gold to purchase your services for a year thereafter at an agreed-upon price. So this is my formal proposition to hire you for a full year. Go on, name your price!" As she said this, she swiped the bag of platinum from the table again, ready to use this as a chance to back Ellesandra into a corner on the bargaining table. There was quite a lot of gold in the coinage of platinum for her to work with, and how she was planning to out-fox the knight wasn't quite clear, but it was their move.

Ellesandra 
She glanced at Morrun curiously at his comment, not quite sure what he was implying there. Her and Star certainly weren't a couple, so it couldn't be that. Shrugging, she looked back at Star and her smile, as well as the challenge she was giving her. Ellesandra didn't name her price, not at first. At first, her eyes scanned Star up and down, trying to determine how serious she was about this. She didn't want Star to feel like she was making her out to be a thief, even though that would be wholly inaccurate and completely within Ellesandra's rights to offer her services for free. Leaning back against the wall, she raised an eyebrow at the woman, then looked to the bag. "Oh, I don't know. I'm thinking for a full year of my service, paid upfront, would be about....440 gold." That would be what was left in there, if Star really took 5 platinum and Ellesandra had taken 1 platinum to pay for her Inn room with. The exact amount, if Ellesandra's calculations were correct. "Considering you are getting the services of a trained Knight, that equals to just over 1 gold a day, doesn't it?" Math was not Ellesandra's specialty and she didn't even try to pretend to do the actual calculation for what it was worth. "If you would rather, you can pay half up front and keep the other half with you in case you need it on your journey. When you earn more you can pay it at the end of the journey." Okay, now Ellesandra was just being snobby, teasing Star into considering keeping the bag of coin herself.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star's reaction was instant. The moment Ellesandra said 440 gold, Star placed the entire bag into Ellesandra's hands, by first gently grabbing their wrist if necessary. There was still the nine gold in change Ellesandra had received that was also in the bag, but Star felt the dramatic act would be subdued if she fished around to grab those coins first. "There. Consider yourself hired, then," she said, arms folded. And through it all, Morrun was just chuckling to himself at the absurdity of this whole ordeal. The gold was right back where it started when he handed it to Ellesandra.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had expected something of that sort, taking the bag and bouncing it in her hand once, as if gauging how much was it in. She even put on the act of opening it and pilfering few some of the coins to better estimate and ensure that they were all platinum, like someone seeing a bag of coin for the first time. "Ah, lovely, perfect, thank you Miss Lumina." A grin was flashed towards Star. "Now, as someone who is invested in this journey we're on, I would like to donate to our group fund, so to speak. This can be used to purchase supplies, buy nights of lodging and pay for any travel costs during our year. Typically this would be entirely at the expense of the client, but again - I am particularly partial to completing this mission and wish to help." She then hefted the bag, weighing it again as if considering how much was in it and how much to give. "So...yes, I think this would do it." Stepping forward, she would take Star's wrist and turn it over, facing up. Her guards were up, expecting the touch, but it was only brief enough to place the bag of coins in Star's upturned palm. "Yes, I think that will do." If Star still resisted, she would just take the bag of coin and set it atop Star's head, before turning to Morrun. "So, we did come here for a purpose, Sir. I believe Star here wished to seek an audience with the leader of this settlement? Something about convincing him to help the town of Cloverport out, set up an allying agreement or something or another. I'm sure my client is better with words than I am, she is the meddler after all." Ellesandra was sporting a smirk the entire time she spoke.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star was immediately ready to counter what she saw coming. Back to this talk of donating, as soon as it came, had Star pouting and putting her hands behind her back, folded over the small of her back and out of reach. The grin she wore said she felt she outfoxed her knightly opponent. But then they just put it on her head. "Wh-- Hey!" she said, doing a good job of balancing the coins on her head. Ellesandra then moving on without giving her a chance to counter seemed to seal the matter. She grumbled, taking the coins off her head as she leered at Ellesandra. Morrun quirked a brow at the knight. "Oh, did you? Here I thought you just saw fit to regale my wife and I in impromptu theatre," he said with a cheeky grin on his face. Lissana had a sweet look on her face while leaning against the wall that connected the dining area and the kitchen. Star, still clearly pouty about being bested at her own game, took a more serious tone when talking to Morrun. "...Yes. The nearby city of Cloverport is overrun with pirates. I mean, obviously. You know that as well as I do. It was my thinking that passing on the news of what happened to you to those in charge of this settlement will be the best course of action. First, because if they have done this once, they are sure to do it again. And as beautiful as this place is, Ellesandra and I aren't long to stay. So a return here after I have achieved my goal to see you both again aside, we won't be here to save any other innocent people here who might be targeted. As necessary as it was to do what we did, it's likely that whether we paid or attacked, the pirates would have felt either emboldened to get away with it again, or in this case, out for revenge. And the people here should not need to feel like they are being hunted. So, much as I detest violence...It's my suggestion that your settlement's hunters take action. Perhaps in a joint effort with the local militia of Cloverport. If the pirate influence is removed, then there will be safe passage, trade, and all the benefits of local cooperation." Star smiled. Morrun considered the words. "Well. You certainly make a diplomatic case for it, Star. But the decision's not up to me on that. I'd also rather not force Lissana to relive any of it, so I'd best speak on her behalf." He paused to smile at his wife, assuring them that he would handle things. Lissana had a small nervousness, a tremor in her figure that spoke of the trauma she would eventually have to deal with. Star clearly noticed, for she was giving Lissana that familiar stare, and it brought sorrow to Star's face. Morrun stood, moving over to the other two after giving his wife a kiss. "I'll see about getting you an audience."

Ellesandra 
She felt a pride and satisfaction fill her when Star pouted and seemed to relent about the coin. Oh, it was entirely possible that Star snuck the coin back somehow later, or just used it to purchase something for Ellesandra or something like that, but really what could she do about that? No, the gold had been given to Star, and it was hers to do with now. The theatre comment caused more amusement as she glanced at Lissana, then back to Morrun as he spoke with Star. Her mood quickly shifted to one of concern when Lissana was brought back up, and the trauma that happened to her. Ellesandra only glanced at her once before looking back to Morrun, not wanting her to feel like she was being stared or watched, or pitied by everyone in the room. At Morrun's confirmation about getting them an audience, she once more spoke up while looking to Star. "Well, while you do that, I believe by how dark it is beginning to get it should be time for some dinner. Lissana, would you like any help in the kitchen?" Ellesandra was not a great cook by any means, but she knew how to do the basic things at least. You didn't live alone travelling along the road without learning how to do camp cooking, and it could only be easier when doing it in an actual kitchen, right? Not to mention, the entire point of the offer was to get Lissana's mind off of the trauma she'd just been reminded of and give her the option of company, if she'd like it.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star and Morrun looked at each briefly. Star smiled. "I'm famished," she said aloud in encouragement to Ellesandra. But there was something subtle to it. It was intentional. Star wasn't one to impose on others, so for her to make such a comment could only be to reinforce a sense of purpose in Lissana, who brightened at the thought of Ellesandra helping, and having something to focus on. "O-Oh, uhm, if you don't mind, Miss Ellesandra," she said, her more meek side appearing as the emotions took hold of her. Lissana had a bright side to her, but she seemed quite susceptible to the fear and discomfort of the memories. She still had fading red marks on her wrists and lips, as well as ankles, which weren't visible before given the woman was wearing long pants, but with her airy summer dress they certainly were. Manacles on wrists and ankles left their marks. "We'll leave dinner to you both then. Be back soon, my love," said Morrun, then existed with Star. Curiously, the coin bag was gone again, nowhere on Star's person. Where had it gone this time? She didn't have sleeves on her dress to slide it up, nor pockets to hide it in. But this wouldn't be something one could focus on long, for the two were out the door soon after.

Ellesandra 
There had been a brief pang of regret when she'd realized Star was going off to the meeting. Ellesandra had thought Morrun was off to set up a meeting, not that the meeting was happening now. Not that Ellesandra cared at all about the meeting itself, but just a matter of not being there in case the leader responded poorly for some reason. She glanced back, watching Star exit and silently hoping she hadn't just put Star in danger by trying to get Lissana's mind off of things. She didn't dwell on it for long, though, before turning to follow Lissana into the kitchen, not having even noticed the disappearance of the coin bag. "No Miss necessary, just Ellesandra is fine." She said, responding to Lissana a bit belatedly. She was being gentle, and would stand to the side, waiting for Lissana to guide her. This wasn't her kitchen, nor did she know what they were going to be making, so she stood at the ready. "What can I help with? I certainly don't want to get in your way with my help, so feel free to tell me where to go and what to do." Someone who had been chained up being able to tell others what to do, not just be told what to do, would be helpful right? Ellesandra wasn't sure how to approach this, but she was going off of gut feeling right now.

Ellesandra 
// I'm going to have to call it here tonight, sorry! Gotta go do a few chores before D&D tonight

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Not a worry at all! I'll leave a final post and we'll pick up there next time. Enjoy your D&D! May your natural 20s come when you need them most!

Ellesandra 
// Haha, thank you

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Lissana gave a sheepish nod. She didn't wish to address a knight improperly, less so one that was dually responsible for saving her life. Lissana didn't know what Ellesandra was familiar with doing in the kitchen, but she did assume the others would be out for an hour or more. The notion that they were hungry had Lissana eager to make a bigger meal, so she invited Ellesandra down into the basement of the home. Therein, a cold storage room was set up with small blue mana crystals that kept the room icy cold. Frozen meats kept in storage was something of a higher class amenity, but if nothing else it did suggest that the two of them were capable of parting with five hundred gold somewhat painlessly. It was a lot, but they clearly weren't lacking. They were comfortable. A whole chicken was going to be used as part of it, which Lissana had Ellesandra carry while she grabbed some vegetables, spices, and herbs from her pantry. A couple more things were added to the knight's hold, though Lissana would have to grab it; she shelving was built with elves in mind. And elves were regularly well above six feet tall, so the knight would find much of the higher shelves out of reach without some assistance. All said and done, the two moved back up and Lissana got to focusing on dolling out the tasks. If Ellesandra was familiar with how to butcher a chicken, that would be their job once the plucked chicken carcass had been out long enough to thaw, which curiously only took about ten minutes. Curious magic at work, but quite the convenience. Most of the work was done on a cutting board with the veggies, which were being used both to add substance to the meal as well as to cook with the chicken to impart their flavours. The chicken needed to be sectioned into quarters, and Lissana described the ultimate goal as an aromatic dish that used spice and earthy vegetables on top of an herby rub on the chicken to give it all a wonderful flavour. Potatoes would round out the plate of chicken and veg, with a wholesome chicken-shallot gravy for the whole or part of the meal. An anecdote was thrown in: apparently Morrun liked gravy on everything, jokingly explained as the man bathing his food in it. He had seemed a bit generous with the syrup at breakfast, so it was not a major surprise. But of course, the way Lissana spoke of her husband would come as no surprise in how loving it was. How after however long they were married, she still was as in love with him now as the day they met. But with the focus on the task, Lissana wouldn't stray too far from small talk unless Ellesandra had specific questions.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Heyo! Here to resume if you have time!

Ellesandra 
// Howdy! On mobile getting a few things done today but as soon as I get back to computer I can get you a post! Gonna be like 30 mins or so

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Still waking up a little over here so that works just fine!

Ellesandra 
// Alright, settled in and working on my post!

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra was a good worker. She followed along with Lissana and helped her carry things, doing what she asked. A strange glance was given to the small blue mana crystals, but she didn't comment on them. Her eyes stared up at the tall cabinets far above her head, and was glad that Lissana was getting things out of them instead of her. Once back up in the kitchen, she followed Lissana's instructions. The small talk was all she needed or offered, since unlike Star she had no idea how to help ease the tension that Lissana was probably feeling in regards to the recent trauma she'd had. Ellesandra had offered her company and something to do to distract the elf, and that was about all she knew to offer in a situation like this. The food sounded delicious, and smelled delicious as she was helping prepare it. She was happy to handle the chicken and prepare it, and then begin slicing and chopping vegetables and such, but she left most of the actual cooking to Lissana. Ellesandra knew just enough not to burn the house down and to be able to survive on her own; she wasn't about to step in on Lissana and mess anything up. As Lissana began talking more and more about Morrun, Ellesandra found that would probably be a relatively safe topic to delve into. Asking how they met, who proposed to who and how that went, and all those typical questions she'd learned the kitchen and serving staff would gossip about growing up. Ellesandra had never really partaken in said gossip and girlish questions, but it didn't mean she hadn't been around enough to listen in and hear the types of things that were asked. Beyond that, Ellesandra was quiet and let Lissana talk, or let a comfortable silence build between them.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The story that Lissana had to tell on the matter was a simple but cute one. Morrun was a planar scholar, Lissana a teacher of the Seldarine teachings. The inn bore the same name in part - 'Seldarine'. She went on to explain it was the elvish pantheon, though she didn't get into technical details. But it had sparked a connection, with the two meeting in a library and discussing a place known as the Feywild for so long that the library had to inform the two of them mid-conversation that they were closing for the day, and on that night the two walked among the stars and simply explored the connection they felt. It led to a swift romance borne of a shared scholarly interest, and of course helped by the fact that the two found one another so very beautiful. Morrun proposed to Lissana quite quickly by elvish standards - it was only twenty years later! Which, if that brought with it any confusion would lead to Lissana speaking to how Morrun was two-hundred and seven years old, and Lissana was one-hundred and eighty five. Still quite young, by elvish timelines. Lissana then took a break from cooking while there was less to do and jaunted up the stairs to come back down with an oil painting that had been made of them on their wedding day, showing Morrun in a stylish dark-green set of his finest clothes, with Lissana in a brilliant emerald-green dress. The painting was well done. Not a masterwork, but a competent painter certainly was wielding the brush. Of course, it would have taken more than a day to create such a thing, so the two likely dressed up more than a few times to get this done. A beautiful memento, all the same. She returned it to their bedroom once she had shown it off thoroughly, then returned to finish cooking. Between the story and the cooking, it did seem to have Lissana in higher spirits. A bandage for the pain for the day, even if it was still going to be a long road ahead for Lissana. Nightmares were sure to come, but that Lissana was saved allowed them to take on a semblance of normalcy that would certainly see them healing in time. They had safety and a loving husband. They would be okay. Time passed, and while the food cooked, Lissana saw fit to prepare a dessert as well. A pie, she settled on, but there was some indecision about what filling to use. She would take Ellesandra's input if they had any, but if not she would make an apple pie for no particular reason other than having a bit of a surplus of apples. Morrun and Star were taking a bit longer than one might expect, but surely they would return soon.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra was patient in listening to the story, offering a smile in the right spots and nods and attentively listening to the elven woman. The painting surprised her, eyes raising in surprise at the idea of them having gotten that painted and how much effort that must have taken. They certainly were well off then, between the mana crystals and being able to afford such a painting. Eventually, Ellesandra had just stopped working, letting Lissana take over the activities and more just keeping her company in the kitchen, in order to prevent them from running out of things to do to keep Lissana busy. When the topic of pie was brought up and the option of what to use for it, Ellesandra recommended blueberries if they had any left from breakfast. She didn't elaborate on why, though Lissana had been at breakfast that morning and had clearly seen Star get teary eyed about the knight sharing her blueberries. She'd glanced out the window occasionally, as time passed getting a little worried that something might have gone wrong with this meeting. Surely if it had been a quick meeting they would have been back by now, right? Then again, it was entirely possible they just had to wait for a while to be able to even meet with the leader of the camp, if the person was busy with other things. Or even Star being her meddlesome self and actively helping plan. A soft smile crossed her lips in amusement at the thought of Star bent over a war table with a map of Cloverport on it, pointing out where the ships were and everything else she remembered about the pirates. Maybe not actively suggesting battle tactics - that didn't seem up Star's alley - but providing as much information as possible definitely did. Moving to lean back against the wall again, she'd look towards Lissana and change the topic so it didn't get stale. "So Seldarine is an Elven deity? Is there anything I should know about them? I apologize, I'm not particularly versed in deities beyond those I grew up with. The land I grew up with mostly served Tyr, though I was particular to Torm in my youth. Knighthood and all, tended to be dedicated to loyalty and honor." Less personal, hopefully, but also a topic most people found uplifting. Ellesandra may have long lost her faith in deities being righteous or good as they might proclaim to be, but she knew that religion was important to a lot of people in time of hardship.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
"Hm? Oh, it's not a single deity. It's in reference to one of the two elvish pantheons. Without bridging into the entire history, Seldarine is elvish for 'fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood'. The Seldarine follow Corellon and his consort, Angharradh, among the other lesser deities below. There's much you could learn, but as for what you should know, it is simply that long, long, long ago, Corellon and Lolth were once lovers, but Lolth, called Araushnee at the time, allied herself with Gruumsh to try and kill Corellon. Araushnee was exiled by Corellon, where she took the name Lolth, and with a whole lifetime's worth of reading in the history being skipped, it is now that the Seldarine and Lolth-sworn oppose one another. You will find no drow among our ranks, even if there are some among the drow who do good." She then giggled. "You'll have to forgive me as I acknowledge that you are...Quite exactly the sort of follower of Torm that I envision. Protective, lawful, duty-bound, righteous...I shall have to offer him my thanks in prayer, and perhaps see if there is a temple in his name near us for me to make a donation to. He might certainly have had a hand in bringing you to me in my hour of need; even if he had not, he has guided you to become the sort of person who would do as you had." A smile was given. Of course, Lissana didn't know the particulars of whose idea it was, only that Ellesandra had played a major role in her salvation. She explained all this while working on the filling for what was to be a blueberry pie. If she had any inclination what the recommendation was for, she didn't say anything. But it was after this lecture that revealed Lissana to be quite the religious sort that Star and Morrun returned, walking into the home with calm smiles about them. Though Star had a look about her as she met eyes with Ellesandra. A look of slight nervousness. A look that suggested she might have news that Ellesandra might not like.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra hadn't commented on how she was the exact type of follow of Torm that Lissana would expect. She just silently nodded, knowing that if she disagreed about Torm having anything to do with her rescue it might sound insulting to someone who was so obviously strongly religious. She was also saved from having to find any other topics to discuss by the return of Star and Morrun. Ellesandra quickly looked Star up and down to ensure nothing had happened to her while she was away, the concern that she'd had quickly turning to relief, then confusion and concern again when she met eyes with Star. Then dread and acceptance. She sighed, running a hand through her hair before pulling it up into a ponytail again, just so it would be out of the way when it came to whatever she had just been volunteered to do, or for dinner. "I take it we're joining the return trip to Cloverport? Or is that look for some other reason?" She eyed Star, taking a wild guess at what that nervousness might be for. Star was a meddler, and she'd thought that maybe Star had just been helping plan. But maybe Star had actively volunteered their assistance; it was the most likely option, Ellesandra thought. Of course it was also possible that Star had somehow insulted the elven leader and they were being kicked out, but that seemed more like something she would do, not Star. A glance was given over to the food cooked, and then a polite nod offered to Morrun, before looking back to Star to wait for the news that she was probably not going to like.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
"Oh, good. You already heard," said Star with a nervous smile that silently said 'don't kill me please'. "...Though technically it's only my own services that were required to convince the council. A compelling argument was made that I had no business requesting others risk their life if I was not willing to do the same; there was quite the disagreement between two of the council members, one stating that the elves were safe here and that the solution was for nobody to be leaving without escort, the other saying that it was cowardly to hide in this place waiting to be discovered...It grew a little heated for a moment," explained Star, though she kept a chipper tone. "All is well though. And as much as I can insist that you yourself aren't required to join along, Ellesandra, I know how futile that line of discussion is so...We move at dawn. For what it's worth though, I only am acting as a healer, behind any frontline we establish. The wounded will be brought back so I can help minimize injury or loss of life. I'm more of a liability in a full scale fight like this anyway. As you saw I can protect myself but...Not for a protracted fight." Morrun said nothing, just moved to his wife. Lissana looked initially concerned, but hearing that Star wouldn't be on the front did ease her worried looks a touch. "The plan is to make contact with the local lord. Then, in tandem with the local militia, the force ought to be so overwhelming as to force a retreat. And when the pirates run back to their ships to set sail, the coastal ballistae will sink them." A sound plan in theory...But it had yet to touch upon the matter of how the pirates got in in the first place, with such defenses at the ready. By chance, perhaps? Stealth? The jolly roger handn't been flown on any ships after all. But surely the port city had guardsman enough to fight back? There remained pieces that might not be known, and could either be nothing at all, or details that could turn a bloodless confrontation into choas in moments.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at the 'already heard' part. She hadn't, she had just guarded a meddler before. Star was way too similar to Marigold. It gave Ellesandra the exact exasperation she'd felt before, and that was both a pleasant thing to feel again as well as painful, remembering the last thing Marigold had meddled in and how that had turned out. She rubbed her face with her hand, exasperation and stress obvious even without Star's ability to see it, but what Star would be able to see - beneath everything - was an ounce of pride in her for not just backing down. "Fine, back lines is good. I'll accompany and guard to ensure that they don't flank you or send someone in as a spy but is actually injured or anything." Ellesandra's actual talents would be better on the front lines, but she was not leaving Star. And she was not bringing Star with her to the front lines, so rear guard it would be." A deep breath was taken, then she looked over to Lissana and Morrun. "Good thing we'll be filling up on food tonight. Should get plenty of rest before setting off tomorrow." Ellesandra hoped the attack and retaking of the city would be as easy as Star had just laid it out. She highly doubted it would, though. She didn't know how the pirates had taken the place over, but it was likely they had inside men. If the elves were contacting the local lord, it was very possible they could be walking into a trap. There wasn't exactly fear, in regards to this, but caution and concern for Star in this whole process. Damned pure hearted women not knowing when to refuse a risk. "Any other news that I should know in regards to your meeting tonight, or the new mission tomorrow?"

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star of course knew that Ellesandra didn't hear about the plans ahead of time. How could they? Only Star and Morrun knew; the rest of the hunters would convene through the night, go through their reverie, and be ready by dawn. Star and Ellesandra had the disadvantage of needing twice as much rest as everyone else in this settlement, so they would need to sleep sooner rather than later. Star nodded to the notion of Ellesandra staying on the backlines. There was a bit of relief in her own face. Not that she believed the pirates could best Ellesandra in battle, but she didn't want to invite the knight to injury either. She shook her head to the question of other news. "That's about it. We all agree the threat to the region is too great to ignore. I will simply need to meditate tonight before bed, so I will need time alone after, and after tending to your wounds." Of course Star wouldn't forget about that part. "My meditation will ensure I am in top shape for tomorrow, so you can rest easy tonight, Ellesandra. We'll meet here at dawn tomorrow, then join the rear guard at the gates." With all that squared away, if there was no other business, it became time to eat.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra shook her head. "No need to heal me. I'll be fine, and I'd rather you be up to absolute full strength tomorrow if you're going to be healing those who are injured. My guess is you'll have a lot more work to be doing tomorrow than I will." If things went to plan, that was. Rear guard only saw action if things didn't go according to plan. Otherwise, she was probably going to be just a bell girl, running to and fro getting supplies and helping carry injured people in or something. She'd done that role before while in rear guard; it wasn't like she was just going to be standing around, but the difference between doing any small task Star would need of her versus actively healing injuries was pretty major. As it came time to food, Ellesandra would help Lissana bring it all out to the table, and then move to take the same seat she had before. A polite nod was given to Lissana in thanks for the food, overall, and she eyed the chicken with more interest than she had the pancakes and sausage this morning. She didn't just delve into it, though. She would wait and be polite, letting everyone else grab at their food first. She'd talked quite a bit with Lissana earlier, so unless she was directly spoken to she was quiet, letting her introversion recharge, but she was attentive to the conversation nonetheless, glancing back and forth during any small talk over dinner to follow who was talking and what they were saying. She seemed relatively at peace, still having some concern for Star but mostly just relaxed - probably some of the most relaxed Star had seen from Ellesandra yet.

// A handful more pictures of Star are being kept in reserve for just in case you stumble on specific scenes / moments in the story. Just a little visual flair to add, where appropriate.

Ellesandra 
// Good to know

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
"We'll be in combat tomorrow. I'm healing you tonight," said Star with a stern tone. That wasn't negotiable it seemed, and Star didn't seem keen on hearing otherwise. So unless Ellesandra was keen on squabbling some more in front of the married couple, dinner began and the relaxed atmosphere was pleasant. Star didn't seem interested much at all in the chicken. A small piece for her. Lissana took a leg, and Morrun a breast, leaving a good amount left for Ellesandra. Star seemed to prefer eating fruits and veggies. Not a strict vegetarian by any measure, but she clearly had her preference if these meals had been any indication. It also likely mattered whether there was a choice in the matter or not; living on the wilderness, small game and protein was a necessary food, so even if Star's diet had its preferences, necessity would always trump them in all likelihood. Small talk was all that amounted from the table. Lissana spoke of showing off the wedding portrait, and of course Star insisted on seeing it, so it was brought down again for Star to see after the meal. Plenty of food for all it seemed, leaving Ellesandra a solid half of the chicken to themselves. A good, filling meal; the elven herbs and spices gave the meal a subtle, earthy flavour that was wholesome and left one's gullet feeling pleasantly plump with a lingering, herby aftertaste that set them all up quite well for dessert. Lissana was no gourmet chef, but it was the sort of staple meal that would never get old on the palette. And as predicted, Morrun's plate was in some places more gravy than it was food. Hard to blame him, as the gravy added even more delight to an already pleasant dish. After some enjoyable small talk, Lissana and Morrun talking about how they met for Star, dessert came. Star gave a playful side-eye to her knightly companion, but it was with a warm smile. No tears this time, thankfully, but Star was clearly in heaven with the dessert. A fresh pie was a perfect finish to the evening. But before Ellesandra could walk away from it all, Star would be sure to get in their way and gesture into the guest room for a bit of privacy so she could heal them. Not that flashing a bit of thigh was all that risque, but better to not force the knight to stand in a position with Star on her knees in front of them for the married couple to joke about.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra didn't fight the comment. She was afraid Star wouldn't understand how much energy it would take to heal her, but she also knew that it wasn't worth having an argument over right now. Instead she fully delved into the chicken. The only kind of meat she liked more than chicken had been salmon, though she had only had that once or twice, and could you really call fish, meat? Either way, she ate plenty, careful not to over eat so that she wouldn't be too tired tonight and thus in the morning, but more than enough to sate herself. Unlike Morrun, she used very little of the gravy, only enough to add a bit of a wetness to the meat and help swallow it down, letting the taste of the chicken itself be the main event on her plate. She also ignored the side eye she got from Star when it came to the dessert, and only ate a very small piece of it. This wasn't to save some for Star, and more that she normally wasn't one for super sweet foods. Savory and salty were her preferences, and pies tended not to be like that. So she ate enough to be polite, especially since she'd been the one to recommend blueberries, but that was about it. As the food was finished entirely and Star insisted again on healing her, she sighed and moved to stand up. "Yes, my lady." The teasing and mocking tone at how Star was ordering her was apparent. There was no malice behind it, just her poking fun at how Star had gone from being a polite companion who 'hired' Ellesandra to now ordering her to get healed. She would walk off towards the guest room, leaving the door open as she stepped in. Not wearing her armor or leggings, she had no real choice but to just drop her breeches down to her knees. She also didn't know what position would be best for Star to do this, so she lowered them to her knees and stood with her legs wide enough apart to prevent them from falling all the way down. Ellesandra wore basic white undergarments, absolutely nothing special and designed entirely for function, not for anything else. Her thighs looked relatively smooth, minus a stray hair here and there since she hadn't exactly been keeping up on keeping them smoothly shaven, and of course the bandages that were still wrapped around where the wound itself was on both thighs. It had fully scabbed over and was healing decently, though was obviously a bit red in irritation at her continued movements and how much weight she'd put on them the previous day while carrying Star.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star gave a playful smile at Ellesandra at the mocking tone. Their little jabs back and forth were in good fun, and the mystic woman clearly understood and was happy to play along. It allowed a more casual closeness between them, rather than a stiff one between hired hand and patron. Even if that was technically the case, the way Star treated it was anything but; she would be just as insistent on this even if she hadn't hired Ellesandra, and had no intentions now or ever to use that agreement against the knight. Star did have a bit of a blush as the knight dropped their pants. Rather unavoidable, but with them standing like this to allow Star at their wounds, it was a rather...Awkward position as Star got down on her knees and moved her hands to the knight's thighs. Gentle hands removed the bandages and examined the wounds. She smiled, seeing they were healing nicely. But she wasn't about to leave them as they were. Her fingers moved onto the wounds themselves, pressing the pads of her four primary fingers vaguely equidistant from one another across the length of the cuts. Then, a gentle flow of something that was...Magical, yes, but it did not feel the same as any other times others had healed Ellesandra. First there was a small tingle of magic, something that touched against the resistance Ellesandra had like a wave upon a wall of rocks. Then...A flowing sensation through that resistance. Not pierced, but...Bypassed all the same, as if whatever Star was doing didn't fit the same mold of what Ellesandra's innate resilience was accustomed to. It looked effortless to Star, but then again so did her radiant, rainbow armor. And both of them saw how that went. But after this sensation came the soothing. The pain melted away. The irritation ebbed. The skin glowed under her touch, and the wounds vanished in a blink. The rash, the scabs, were no more. Star looked at the results, then smiled and rose to her feet again, keeping eyes above the waist to allow the knight to get their modesty back. "There. Wasn't so bad, was it?" she said, warmly smiling. "And look, I'm not doubled over heaving. I promise...I'll be more than ready for whatever tomorrow brings. I won't be acting alone, so the burden of healing will be spread among the group of healers." Star certainly seemed to be fine moving on like nothing happened, but...There was no ignoring that whatever she did, nothing about it should have played out as it had with the way Ellesandra's resistances were. It defied explanation. Was Star just...Special like that? Or was something else going on? The wounds were healed, that was certain. But...How? Did Star just expend a mountain of energy to do it? She certainly didn't seem fatigued...But maybe she was hiding it, and waiting for Ellesandra to leave before doubling over in exhaustion?

Ellesandra 
She felt the awkwardness, and turned her gaze up so that she wasn't looking down at Star while she was doing her work at all. Her muscled thighs tensed and flexed at the feel of Star's hands on them, even just removing the bandages, and when she felt Star begin to use magic, Ellesandra had actively prepared herself to allow magic in. Naturally, magic seemed to roll off of her if it was directly targeted at her. Generic, area spells didn't exactly roll off of her, but tended to have less severe of an effect. Healing magic was a direct target, and between the magic usually rolling off and Ellesandra's body also wanting to naturally absorb the mana and energy within the spell, she had to actively focus on NOT doing that. She couldn't stop her natural resistance, but she could stop her body from trying to just suck in the mana. It was an important skill she'd learned when she'd first discovered her abilities, found after absorbing too much magic unintentionally and causing a severe mana sickness in herself. The healing didn't go as she expected. Oh, she still had to prevent herself from drawing in some of Star's mana and energy with the healing, but her natural resistance seemed to just...not exist. She looked down, over her shoulder at where the wounds were when Star stood up, frowning at how simple it had been. Star didn't LOOK fatigued or as if she had tried to just power through a strong barrier. The confusion was evident, even as Ellesandra reached down and pulled her breeches back up, re tightening them around her waist. Her eyes never left Star with a frown on her face, turning to her and crossing her arms. "Either you're hiding how much energy you just put into that or there is something you're not telling me, Star." Neither option was good, honestly. The former was bad for her role tomorrow, the latter was bad for her knowing what to expect. "I have never been healed as easily as that, not without a healer expending an enormous amount of energy to do so. I have scars all over my arms and torso for that reason. Why were you different just now?"

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
There was a knowing look on Star's face. There was no doubt she knew that this was wrong somehow for the knight. But for a moment she collected her thoughts, considering how she might make this out such that Ellesandra didn't chide her. Or chide her...As much. Star folded her hands behind her back, looking somewhat like a kid with their hand caught in the cookie jar. "Well. I know regular healing spells, of course. But I felt the resistance on you, and that wouldn't have worked very well. Much as you might not believe me, I do think about how to properly expend my mana so that I can do all that I need to do, as well. I know I'll need my reserves for tomorrow. So brute forcing past your resistance wasn't a smart idea. So instead I used..." She paused, pursing her lips. "...Another method. Something unique to me. My mother called it 'sympathetic healing'. It'll probably be how I have to heal you each time I do. But look!" she said, throwing her arms up in the air with a smile. "I'm fine! No need to fuss!" Her reaction was a little...Forcibly chipper. Trying to keep Ellesandra from asking too many more questions, perhaps? After all, Star did swear not to lie to them, so it was likely if there was more to it, any further questioning would ensure Star spill the beans so as to not be lying by omission. Still. The hope was there that her given, surface explanation was enough. It probably wouldn't be. But she could hope.

Ellesandra 
// I think I might know what you mean by sympathetic healing but Ellesandra isn't going to be smart enough to get that. But if she finds out, Star is in SO MUCH trouble

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Teehee~

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra was suspicious. Star seemed to be too chipper about healing her. Her lips pressed into a thin line and her eyes narrowed, watching Star for a moment. There was definitely something going on there, but Star was obviously avoiding talking about it. She looked her up and down once, checking to see any signs of fatigue as if she had, indeed, brute forced the healing. Seeing nothing, she grumbled. "Well, isn't that convenient?" She muttered to herself. Finding the one person who could apparently heal her without any injuries and being hired by her. Shaking her head, she turned to head for the door. "Get some rest then, Star. Whatever it is you did, I'm sure you need to recover from it." It sounded like an order, though Ellesandra wasn't exactly going to be around for it. She looked back over her shoulder at Star, eyeing her up and down again. The suspicion was there; she knew Star was hiding something, she just didn't know what it was. And like the night before, she was not going to be sleeping here with her but at the Inn. "Do you need anything before I go?"

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star looked a little surprised that Ellesandra left it at that. But it was fine. She smiled, and shook her head. "I'm quite all right. I'll be in meditation for a while, so please pass on my goodnights to Morrun and Lissana and ask them to keep the door closed, as I will need peace for it. It will ensure I am, as promised, in tip top shape for tomorrow. We'll see peace brought back to this region by sundown, Ellesandra." She smiled again. "Sleep well. I'll see you at dawn." And if that was that, she saw fit to set up on the bed and begin her meditation, trusting Ellesandra to close the door behind them before going to the inn. Presumably, Ellesandra had some coin of their own for the inn, as Star had been 'donated' back the large sum given by Morrun.

Ellesandra 
She watched Star for a moment longer. She let the pause extend even after Star reassured her, and wished her a good night. A moment for Star to open up about whatever magic that was. She flexed her thighs, feeling the fully healed skin and that it didn't hurt at all anymore. When nothing came, she just nodded. "Sleep well." The door was shut behind her and she headed off into the main room, smiling to Lissana and Morrun. "She'll be meditating and then heading to sleep to prep for tomorrow, so please don't disturb her unless necessary. Lissana, before I head back to the Inn to do the same myself, would you like any assistance with cleaning dinner up?" They had, after all, just went straight back to Star's room right after dinner. It was only in hindsight that Ellesandra had realized how potentially rude that had been, and was entirely prepared to help clean up or do whatever dish washing would be needed before going to the inn for another night's rest. When she returned bright and early in the morning, she'd be fully armored again and prepared for battle, warrior's ponytail and all.

Ellesandra 
// Gotta step away for a little bit. Will be like 30-45 mins

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The lingering moment on Star eroded her. That something was left unsaid, that Ellesandra knew it...Star could not allow it to go without being said. She had thought she wanted it, because it would keep Ellesandra from being upset. If Ellesandra had just left promptly, it would have happened differently. But Star could not accept feeling like she had lied to Ellesandra. So... "...I took your pain," she said just as Ellesandra turned. She then turned and lifted the skirt of her dress to show the location where the wounds had been on Ellesandra. There was no wound to be seen, but there was a slowly fading mark on her skin, a magical line that copied the shape of Ellesandra's wound. Admiring Star's shapely legs and smooth, feminine thighs would have to wait for another time that she wasn't exposing them for a purpose that would likely anger Ellesandra to some measure. "The wound does pass to me initially. But it heals. I am not damaged by this. My body does not suffer broken skin nor bloodloss. It is taken unto my aura instead." She looked at Ellesandra sternly, then. "I need you to hear me when I tell you I am not harmed by this act. I take on the agony of the wound...And it does take from my magical strength." She lowered her skirt again, turning to face Ellesandra once more. "But the mightiest strength of auramancy, of my magic, is known as purity of self. Disease, afflictions, wounds...So long as my aura remains strong, these melt off of me. I have no scars on my body, despite being wounded many times. Of course I can still suffer mortal blows, hence my ability to harden my aura to an impenetrable armor, as it is better to be exhausted than dead. So before you chide me...It is my purpose and desire to take the burdens of others. I know my limits. I will not use this power recklessly or foolishly. But had I been there to heal you when your arm was damaged, I would have saved you from the lingering injury, and would not have suffered it myself beyond however many hours or days of pain I would endure as my aura cleansed me of its influence." She sighed. "...I might still be able to undo what was done, with time. But for now, I simply...Needed to know that I could heal you, if it came to it. If it comes a time where it is martial prowess we require, and you have been critically wounded...Our best chance will be for me to endure the agony instead, and allow you to fight on. So before you think me foolishly taking a wound of yours that I know you're more than capable of enduring yourself...Understand that my mind thinks days, weeks, months ahead of now in this moment." Clearly, with all that she had to say on the matter, she was very much anticipating that Ellesandra would be none too pleased about this revelation of what Star would need to do to heal them. Not a mortal danger but...If Ellesandra was run through, left with a crippling wound...Star would be left suffering intensely for her efforts to heal them. But the utility of it was clear. Even if it meant Star passed out from the pain, she could surge Ellesandra back into the fight. And while against drunk pirates it was unlikely to be anywhere near necessary, there might come a time where it was needed. At least now, with Star keeping to her promise of honesty, Ellesandra had a chance to draw boundaries for it.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had turned, preparing to walk out before pausing when Star spoke up. She stood, frozen for a moment at that first sentence. There was shock, as that had NOT been something she had been expecting at all. Then, the shock quickly morphed into anger. She turned around, eyes narrowed and glaring at Star with a fury that looked like it could burn the room down. She stepped back inside the room, closing the door behind her again, though from here - she didn't know what to do. She obviously wasn't going to stomp towards Star and intimidate her; that wasn't how she would ever deal with her anger. And this wasn't her room to break anything, which was also unhealthy way to deal with her anger. So she stood, jaw clenched and glaring at her as Star explained what happened, showed her, and then try to make excuses for it. All of these words, so much explanation, just for Ellesandra to feel the anger still there. The thing was, it wasn't anger that Star had caused pain on herself for healing her; though Ellesandra hated the idea of that, it was that Star hadn't seen fit to tell her she was testing this. She wouldn't have been happy with the idea, but Star made very good points in that it would be useful to know how it worked, in case it was ever needed on their journey. She hated the idea of it being needed, and as if she needed another reason not to let herself get injured, she resolved to ensure it wasn't. No, overall, she was upset at the ruse. It was the first breach of trust Star had done, and it coming from someone who seemed as pure hearted and honest as Star, that hurt. Well, Ellesandra's form of hurt was lashing out in anger, so it she didn't really feel the hurt itself, but it was there. And then another thought came to her mind. Could Star take the pain from her emotions, too? There was a fear that Star would try, somehow, to remove that 'nonexistant' mountain and take it upon herself. Would Star even be able to? Surely the woman was better at processing emotions than she was, but it had been three years building, being repressed, building more, and being further repressed. If or when it was ever fully released, it would probably crush whoever felt it. "You." The word came out thickly. She had to force it out in a way that could be understood. "Will never do that without explicit permission again. Ever. Do you understand, Miss Lumina?" Ellesandra would not lash out against Star physically, ever, but verbally? Returning back to title, rather than first name, was the minimal indication of how this conversation was part of their business arrangement; not of their budding friendship.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
A nuance to Star's powers was proven in this moment. Ellesandra didn't need to say a word for their feelings to come across. It was instant, and Star recoiled upon seeing the anger. Rather immediately, tears formed in her eyes. Regret. Sadness. Pain. It was writ across her face as the tears flowed down her cheeks; she repressed the sobs that wished to join it, but she couldn't hide the tumultuous emotion that raged in her. "The times it has its uses are times where acquiring explicit permission may not be a luxury," came her response. She was upset, obviously. Wishing she had handled it another way, perhaps. But there was a fire in her eyes that matched Ellesandra's own. "Saving your life may require a decision that moves my body before I consciously make a decision," she continued, her figure trembling, but standing with the conviction with which she risked her life in Cloverport. "And even though you've sought to fight me at every turn to be of use to you, to help you, I won't let anyone stand in the way of keeping you safe. Not even you." She couldn't know the specific reasons for Ellesandra's anger, but a general sense was enough for the immediate moment. She was obviously scared. Not of Ellesandra hurting her. But that she might have hurt Ellesandra. Her words were soft-spoken, spoken through tears. She wasn't wishing to make an argument out of it, or disturb the elven couple. But there was an...Intense concern in her. A flame that burned behind her eyes directly straight at Ellesandra. "That's all this was. When my regular healing failed, that's all I had left. And whether you want to try and hurt me by using my last name to make distance from me or not won't stop me from caring, either. You saved me, and have shown me how much deep kindness you have inside you. That cannot be undone. I will do whatever it takes to ensure we both get to walk away from whatever tries to impede us in our travels. I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me. So just...S-Stop trying to keep me from doing my part!"

Ellesandra 
The tears should have assuaged some of her anger. They should have warned Ellesandra to back off. Seeing Star react so immediately should have told her to shut up and just leave, before things got worse. Somehow, though, they just made her even more upset. Guilt leaked out of the mountain, and as Star tried to defend her actions, defend that she would do this with or without Ellesandra's permission in the future, Ellesandra was prepared to just leave. Cut the conversation before she did something stupid. And then there was that line. 'I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me.' The mountain broke open and, completely without thought, Ellesandra stepped directly up to Star. "And I've already had one charge give her life for mine, I will NOT have another do the same." She didn't even realize she was saying the words until after they were out. Such was the way anger worked; you spoke subconscious, not even considering the impact or truth of words. The pain as soon as they left her mouth hit hard. She took a step back, hardly holding in the sob that immediately bubbled up from the crack in said mountain. It didn't matter that Star wasn't talking about giving her life for Ellesandra, but just taking her pain and wounds. To her, in this moment, they were one and the same. Star would be taking the punishment that should be Ellesandra's. She couldn't be here with Star, who she knew would be able to see how the guilt and pain completely consumed her. She spun and slammed the door shut behind her before Star could try to follow out, not even looking at Morrun or Lissana as she left the hut. She'd held back the sob just barely, but there were tears on her cheeks. She didn't make her way to her room though, figuring if Star followed she'd assume that's where Ellesandra went. No, she went straight for the meadow, hoping it would be mostly empty that evening.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Quite a lot of things fell into place in that moment for Star. Her eyes widened. Shock filled her. She was in no state to stop Ellesandra. No state to say anything. To realize that...For Ellesandra, Star's staunch conviction, the desire to do whatever was necessary to care for the knight...It played right into their guilt, into the pain that the knight felt. That every time Star should valiance in the face of danger, it was undoubtedly making Ellesandra fear that history would repeat itself. Star didn't want to die, but...As Ellesandra slammed the door and stormed out, Star had to sit with her own thoughts and decide...If it came to it, would she give her life for Ellesandra? Would that answer change, knowing they already had someone sacrifice themselves for them? A lot was revealed about the knight's actions without it being directly revealed. And Star would remain in her room for a short while. An hour or so. But the empath was, by some estimations...Incorrigible. Time was needed, yes. But so were apologies. And try as Ellesandra might to elude Star, it remained the unfortunate truth that...A strong emotion was felt by Ellesandra. Very strong. And the stronger an emotion, the more it could guide Star. So she followed them. It was just past sundown. The early beginnings of night, with an orange haze still bleeding over the horizon as it crest over the pond of the meadow. No others were there. All had returned to their homes. And Ellesandra was free to have it to themselves. But after about an hour, Star found her way there. And if Ellesandra was still present, Star stayed out of sight initially. Somewhere close, but not intruding, as if needing to make a final decision on her plan to either walk over and speak, or do something else.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// showed* valiance, not should.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra had been thankful it was empty when she arrived. She was laying down in the meadow, not far from where they had been laying just earlier that day. It was a good thing that Star could see emotion, as far away it might be hard to see her, and she was keeping quiet in her sobs. Still, they were sobs. She was curled up on her side, knees pulled up to her chest and her face buried in them. She was trying her best to put the lid back on, to take the guilt and the grief and shove them back down, back into the mountain and just pretend they didn't exist. She couldn't, though. Not entirely. The memory of Marigold looking up into her captors faces. A mix of fear and determination before the blade fell. Ellesandra was wracked with the guilt, and the pain wasn't like one who had lost a charge they weren't close to. It was heartbreak, the feeling that one who had loved another felt at their death. With Stars abilities to see emotions, it was like a major beacon pointing her to where Ellesandra was. And by the time Star found her, she had made little progress in shoring up the hole that had formed. The physical pain that encompassed the emotional, the feeling that her chest was being literally ripped open. Old wounds, the same ones experienced that day, throbbed. Her right arm, her left side, and her left shoulder. But the physical pain was nothing compared to the turmoil that three years of repressing the grief and guilt brought. Ellesandra had never properly processed her death; she hadn't let herself. On the best of days, she pretended it didn't happen. That she was out on a mission, that was it. On the worst, she distracted herself from the guilt. Whatever would do, however she could. She didn't let herself feel it, and when she suddenly admitted to that to Star. That Marigold had died to save her, she just couldn't anymore. It was the first time she'd admitted it in more than her dreams or her thoughts, and putting words to it had made it real.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
It killed Star to see the knight in such a state. To be so stricken, so alone...Star would not stand for it. Ellesandra did not know it, but their anger, their sorrow, their grief, it all left a long, wispy trail of emotion and memory on the aether that Star followed. One she could read. One she could cradle against her and feel the emotion, take unto herself the memory that brought such pain into existence. But she recalled her promise to Ellesandra. She did not dive into the memory, even if it was right in front of her. It was a breach of their trust to do so. She moved out from her place out of sight. Her own tears were plentiful, though she held her sobs in. Her pain was for Ellesandra; this moment was not about her or how she hurt, it was entirely about them. She moved to where they were laying. She laid before them. Close, but not too close. She laid on her side, though not hugging her legs to her chest to hide. She didn't need Ellesandra to notice her or react. Even if it was just that she was here with them, in this moment, so they wouldn't have to be alone as they faced such pain...That was enough. Though of course, if they did notice her, she was sure to raise the arm not pinned under her side to leave open the same comfort to Ellesandra that they offered her, even if she knew the knight was far less likely to accept such physical comforts, least of all from Star herself given what happened with that contact.

Ellesandra 
The emotions rolled from Ellesandra in waves. Guilt, pain, sorrow, guilt again. The guilt was the strongest thing, influencing more pain and grief than just having had someone close to her die. That she felt fully responsible for the death was what truly hit Ellesandra hard; that she had been tasked to protect someone, and had failed so miserably at her job it had gotten her killed. Well, that wasn't entirely fair, objectively, but Ellesandra was anything but objective in regards to this. The sobs had slowed, but she still lay there, curled up on herself and silent tears running down her cheeks. Her eyes were closed and she was much too distracted to notice Star's approach, so there was no immediate reaction when Star lay down next to her. Ellesandra's face was mostly hidden, with her head down where her forehead pressed against the top of her knees. Through bangs of hair falling around the top of her head Star would be able to see the streaks of tears, and her knuckles were white with how hard she had been holding onto her own legs. With the lack of anyone she trusted or felt comfortable with holding her, Ellesandra held herself. Eventually, she shifted, a discomfort with how she was laying, and that is when she saw Star laying in front of her. Seeing Star obviously surprised Ellesandra and she jumped, her body all but leaving the ground for a moment in the intensity of her surprise, and her eyes gone wide. And then the shame and embarrassment hit, at how she'd reacted to Star, and that Star was now seeing her like this. No one saw her like this. She'd never broken down like this in a situation where anyone had access to her before. Seeing Star's arm raise, she looked at the arm, then Star for a moment, hand moving up to wipe at her face as if to try to make herself presentable. It was a moment of indecision. She wanted the physical comfort, but did she want that from Star? Not just because of the whole touching and emotions thing Star did, but she'd known star for...not even two days, at this point. And Star had already devolved Ellesandra into a sobbing mess. Her eyes moved down to her own body again and then without a word she turned so that her back was to Star, not wanting her to see Ellesandra this way. Not wanting her to see how broken she was inside, and didn't let anyone else see. The guilt was still there, even as it was now successfully being buried again. The start of another mountain; though this one would be significantly smaller.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star did expect a rejection. She didn't take it personally. She knew she was the exception rather than the rule to how quickly people became accustomed to hugging, to touching. It was very different for her, for an empath. It was an expression of her openness and trust in others, for Star had advantages others did not. A nigh flawless insight into someone's heart, into their motivations. A moment's study was all she needed to know if someone wished her harm, either directly or subtly. Ellesandra had no such guarantees. They were their own, only source of comfort. She was okay with this for now. She wanted more, of course. But she wouldn't demand it. She could only show it with her tears, with her sorrow, with the depths of sympathy in her eyes. "I am so...So...So sorry, Ellesandra," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She kept her sobs subdued, still. "For...So many things."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra didn't respond, not at first. She wasn't able to, opening her mouth and feeling just a tight throat and air whistling out. It took her a few moments of trying to calm her emotions to be able to force her throat to loosen up enough to speak. "Don't...apologize for something that is not your fault, Star, or you had no way of knowing." Ellesandra pulled her knees up to her chest again, arms wrapping around them. She was the one who hadn't told anyone anything. Star couldn't be held accountable for saying something that triggered Ellesandra when she had no way of knowing it would. And Star didn't actually do anything wrong, either. She was just trying to do what she thought was right, even if Ellesandra still had a smoldering flame of anger at her taking her pain without discussion. She placed her forehead on her knees, adopting the same position Star had seen her in when she approached, just with her back to Star now.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star was reassured slightly by Ellesandra speaking at all. Not so much by their words; she cared little for absolution, she knew Ellesandra was hurt, and her actions, knowing or not, were at least partly to blame. Star had her stubborn moments, certainly. But she was quicker than most to step back and accept guilt unto herself under most circumstance. Hardly perfect, but...A reminder of what was important, a reminder of the humanity of the moment, was all it took to center herself again here. To remember what mattered. "I will apologize," she said, her voice still soft, yet carrying that selfsame emotional conviction. "...Because someone has to. Your tears have no business falling alone." She paused. She had to choose her words carefully, with Ellesandra so obviously vulnerable. "I was so caught up in my own fears that it blinded me to yours. And I've far less excuse than most for that. I...Was so worried that you would keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing yourself to the point that you would break, to the point that I wouldn't be able to save you...It made me feel...Desperate. It's...No excuse. Just an explanation. So you know that though every action I've taken, I've kept you in my mind. I know the things I do can seem...Reckless. Thoughtless, even. And I can promise you it's nowhere near the truth, but...I know that can't stop that deep fear in you. Just like it can't stop it in me. So...I promise all the things I've said, still. I promise I won't pry. I promise, however, that I'll still be here, every step of the way. And that I want to know...I want to be here for you. But that I'll let you decide what to share with me." A pause for breath. "...And most of all I promise that I'll never stop fighting to stay alive. I won't let death claim me. I can't. And as much as you'll let me...I'll rely on you to make that a reality." Another brief pause. "I...Didn't come here to make you talk, though. I didn't come here to make you do anything. So you don't...Have to say anything. I just hope you'll let me stay with you, so you don't have to have to cry alone. Because my heart can't bear that."

// If Ellesandra doesn't respond, would Star do anything else? Deciding if I should push forward to Ellesandra getting up or leave it open still for you

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// She wouldn't do anything unless Ellesandra reacted. Genuinely just wanting to be with them, though she would react if Ellesandra tried to leave.

Ellesandra 
She waited, listening to Star but not really knowing what to respond to. And was there even an expectation of a response? Probably not. She appreciated that Star promised not to pry, but that still didn't make her feel comfortable with touching Star. Ellesandra didn't let anyone touch her, really; she didn't let herself be vulnerable like that, and that wasn't even considering Star's ability which immediately made it so that the walls Ellesandra did have up meant absolutely nothing. It didn't matter how good she was at hiding her emotions from everyday people; Star could literally see right through her when it came to that. So touching Star made her feel even more vulnerable than just a normal hug. The previous embrace as Star broke down earlier had been more than Ellesandra was comfortable with, but something she felt like she should do, was expected and appropriate for the situation. Now? As much as she might internally want Star to reach out and touch her back, or even cuddle up against her and hold her, she also hated the idea. And so, she laid there as she worked to finish calming herself back down. To push her emotions down enough that she could breath and exist normally again. Her chest still ached from it; the pain was still there, she couldn't get rid of it entirely. She could, however, get rid of the worst of it. Her throat was sore with the intensity of the crying at first, and her eyes puffy and red. Her nose was runny and she sniffed, irritated at it. Finally, she moved to stand up. She didn't look at Star, keeping her face turned away, back to her while she looked up at the sky. "We did say we'd come see the stars tonight." She murmured, as if that had been the reason they'd been out there - not because Ellesandra had broken down, but because they were keeping up on their promise to star watch in the meadow.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star had waited with Ellesandra without another word. Without pushing herself onto them. She just watched their emotions, the turmoil, and the repression. She disagreed with that repression. It made her want to do something drastic again. To pin Ellesandra down and scream at them to stop it, to let themselves feel their emotions instead of ignoring them. But there was only so much she could push the knight before she started pushing them away with what she thought to be caring actions. It meant nothing if it evoked a defensive response that could not be overcome with sincerity and concern. "We did," she said softly to Ellesandra, then moved onto her back, looking up at the stars. "...So won't you lay with me a short while and look at them?"

Ellesandra 
Hadn't she been laying here enough, crying? The thought passed her mind, and how much she just wanted to go back to her room at the inn and curl up on her bed. Maybe cry a little more, though she doubted she had anything left in her. How could one have so many tears? She glanced at Star out of the corner of her eye and took a deep breath, before moving to sit down in the meadow nearby. It wasn't laying down next to Star, but she was still keeping her company, and her eyes turned upwards towards the sky nonetheless. She sat with most of her weight on her rump, knees brought up but spread open this time, with her arms wrapped around them widely and hands held together in front of her. Her head was tilted back, eyes tracing some of the constellations she knew - which weren't many. "Any constellations or stars or anything of particular importance to your family? With your naming theme being all celestial objects like that, that is." There. Conversation that was completely neutral to the pain Ellesandra felt. Trying to be normal.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star smiled quietly. "...The night sky is different in my homeland. I was young enough at the time that the memories aren't as clear as they could be but...The constellations here aren't the same. I'll show you the constellation named after the hero of my realm when we get there. It's called 'Purity'. It's a symbol of hope. The stars align to spread out, curling slightly upward, with pockets of stars in vaguely straight lines extending out from the other stars. It looks like a pair of angel wings. It's a beautiful sight." She smiled, though her eyes were still misty. "I don't know the constellations here, despite my time here. It's not my home. Though being away from where I was born so long, and with the place I was born doubtlessly left as nothing but overgrown ruins now...I don't know if I can rightly call that place home, either. I haven't had a place to call home since I was cast away." She paused, then shook her head. "Gods...Sorry. You just asked about the stars, didn't you?" She sighed. "...They're beautiful, here. Just like you said they would be."

Ellesandra 
She glanced sideways at Star as she talked about home, briefly, before returning her eyes up to the stars. "A constellation of angelic wings, huh?" A symbol of hope. She had to fight back the urge to scoff at the idea. She lowered her gaze back down to the meadow, looking out over it in what light was provided by the stars and the moon that evening. "Stop apologizing when it's not necessary, Star. Stand up for yourself and take up the space you need, or want." She would slowly break that habit of Star, apologizing for unnecessary things, if she stayed with Star very long. Or at least, that was her goal. "Home can be anywhere, or someone. Right now, it sounds like your mom is your home, and you're looking to return to her. If you get there and find that home has been destroyed, you'll grieve, and then you'll find a new home. It's transitory, isn't it?"

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star pouted a little when Ellesandra chided her for apologizing. It was hardly a big deal, so it was taken with a light heart rather than some serious admonishment of her character. "You should probably think twice before you encourage me to be even more stubborn against you, you know," she said with a glance over at the knight in turn. "I don't know if you realize how much I already hold back around you. I know I'm not exactly normal in that regard, but I've never been one to be shy about emotion." She let her gaze linger on Ellesandra for a while with those words. Not an overly heavy tone, but...That selfsame conviction appeared again here. That was her domain. The thing she stood for, even as it balanced against respecting Ellesandra's boundaries. "If I gave all that my heart desired to assert myself with you, well...You'd probably go running for the hills. I can be awfully scary when it comes to emotional matters," she said, offering a playful smile. Star? Scary? Hard to imagine. But she did listen to the words about home, bringing her eyes back to the stars above. "...It is, you're right. We're just guests in the lives of so many people that we meet. We might never see this place again. And there might not be a home waiting for me where we're going." She didn't go anywhere with those words. Just an echo of what they said, perhaps to affirm it all in her heart as she stared at the night sky. A pensive air came over her. It'd be easy to tell, as it generally was with Star, what she was feeling. Longing, perhaps. Depth of thought. A pain bubbling in her, one she was well familiar with. It hurt, still, clearly. Her desire to return home. To close this chapter of her life, so she could grieve if she must, and move forward again.

Ellesandra 
She pursed her lips at the stubborn comment. Did she want Star to be more stubborn? Ellesandra was silent as Star went on about her emotions, and home. There was a sudden defensiveness to her and she had to fight the urge to slide a little further away from Star. Leaning forward, she repositioned so she could place her chin atop her knees, gazing out over the meadow. "Assert your own emotions as much as you want." She said, eventually. "But I've drawn a firm boundary around my own. And I expect you to respect that boundary, as much as your powers allow you to." They would certainly make Star respecting her boundary hard, and Ellesandra recognized that. Normally, her boundary involved not prying into her emotions at all, but it seemed that was all but impossible for Star. Still, there was restraint Star had seemed to show. Ellesandra wasn't going to force her to hold herself back, but she would encourage said restraint in regards to herself. "We should get back, though. Long day tomorrow and I'm sure we both need the rest to prepare. Especially you with needing to meditate to ensure you are fully prepared for what you might be asked to do tomorrow."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star just bore a grin at Ellesandra's words. She refrained from comment, despite mentally imagining Ellesandra saying 'assert yourself! Claim what you want!' followed immediately by 'no wait not like that'. A terribly oversimplified thought made just for amusement, and just for her to hold onto. Something that might have Ellesandra wondering what she found so amusing, but beyond that she rose up to a seated position. She nodded. "I know. But it was important to me that I be with you in this moment. You're important to me, and I'll always do all I can to make sure you know that." She said that, then rose up to her feet, moving immediately towards where she would be sleeping, though she did look over her shoulder and smile. "Good night, Ellesandra. I'll see you at dawn. Sleep well."

Ellesandra 
Her eyes narrowed at Star as she walked away. Ellesandra was important to her, after just two days? "Foolish." She muttered to herself, quiet enough to ensure Star didn't hear her. There was disbelief there, then irritation at Star putting herself at risk like that. To care for someone so quickly was an easy way to get yourself hurt, even if Star could see someone's intentions. People might not intend to hurt others, but they did it all the time anyways. She started her walk back to the Inn, trailing Star long enough to see that she made it back to Morrun's place safely, and then taking the path Morrun had shown her the night before to the Inn to settle in for the night. She did exactly as she'd wanted to before, locking her door then curling up in her bed, covers thrown over her head, and let herself cry more. The remaining pain and guilt that she hadn't been able to repress released, and she finally cried herself to sleep. In the morning, her head ached. Her sinuses were clogged from the crying last night and her eyes were still puffy and red. She slipped out of the covers and began getting ready for the day, doing what she could with water provided to clear up her face so she didn't look like she'd spent the whole night crying despite having done so. She had woken at the first rays of the sun shining through the window, but that meant she hadn't had much time to get ready and put her armor on before they would be leaving most likely. She'd planned to wake earlier, but exhausted eyes from last night had prevented that. So it was about last minute that Ellesandra arrived to Morrun's with her pack on her back, armor on, hair up in a high ponytail, and rapier strapped to her right hip like normal, knocking at the front door if they weren't already outside.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// Just confirming, Ellesandra did sleep, right? There'll be more than a few dream scenes, though not one that requires interaction on this night.

Ellesandra 
// Oh! Yes, she did

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Ellesandra's restlessness was helped little by their dream. It was not one where the woman had lucidity, so it was easier to chalk up to simply tumults of the mind. But in this dream, Ellesandra wandered through a forest that was possessed by endless darkness. No passage out. No certainty of the way forward. And lurking in the edge of Ellesandra's periphery every few minutes was that same inky shadow. That black mass of darkness that stood with the reaper's scythe. A foreboding presence. One that watched, silently. One that did not impede, but its displeasure was clear. It never attacked. It simply watched, then vanished if observed. It was unmistakably the same entity that had tormented Ellesandra on the previous night. But was the demon just a manifestation of Ellesandra's repressed fears, or something else? It would be impossible to know. Ellesandra could only know that even when pushing forward, retreating, attacking, or calling out to this black monster, it did not respond. It vanished before the knight could do anything, always out of reach, yet always watching. Ellesandra would wake in time, granting reprieve from the endless black forest. Their sleep was not the most restful with less time than they might need, but it wasn't particularly disturbed. Perhaps even a break from recurring nightmares; likely less scary than seeing Marigold in their dreams. The result was an almost fully refreshing slumber, but with lingering fatigue to shake off. Some time walking would do the trick. Ellesandra's knock was met with a swift answer. It was breakfast time again, and some notice had been taken of the knight's desires. Ellesandra's plate was given an extra helping of breakfast meats in the way of sausage and bacon, while Star's had a smaller helping of these while piling it more full of fruit and vegetable. Lissana was clearly paying attention. Morrun had syrup-soaked pancakes again, which he ate with glee. Smalltalk was the air for the morning, unless the knight had specific questions or subjects to raise. If not, the group was destined to part ways here, and Morrun and Lissana were sure to send the two off with some prepared bundles of rations. Fruit preserves, nuts, berries, cured meats, even two portions of salted cuts of meat that would last a day or so on the road without spoiling to serve as a good night's meal over a campfire if nothing else could be secured. There was an obvious priority to what would need to be eaten first, but it certainly beat roasted squirrel in terms of quality. It would be the last chance the two had to say goodbye unless they chose to return to this grove another day, or some time in the future.

Ellesandra 
// gonna be afk for a bit, will respond once I'm back

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// No rush!

Ellesandra 
// I'm back, sorry

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
// No apologies needed!

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra definitely hadn't slept well, with the paranoia of that shadow lurking everywhere. And now in the waking world, Ellesandra's paranoia continued. The shadow was too coincidental, to be in both dreams, for Ellesandra to shrug it off. Now, she was looking around, keeping an eye out and watching the shadows as she'd gone to Morrun's, and even while eating. Ellesandra stared at the extra meat on her plate for a moment, blinking a few times and looking over to Lissana in confusion, before eating it anyways. She was quiet throughout the breakfast, introspective and obviously tired, and when they were given all of the supplies for the road, she smiled at Lissana and Morrun politely in thanks. Her dreams had been bothering her, leading her to be even more quiet than normal that morning. As they prepared to go, Ellesandra was looking around, then looking to Star. "Are we supposed to be meeting up with anyone this morning?" As compared to last night, Ellesandra's emotions looked much better controlled and repressed. The mountain was now significantly smaller, and there was a small hole in it that Ellesandra didn't even notice, but the emotions were still held down under it. The main emotions today were a combination of embarrassment, at how she'd acted the night before and how Star had seen her, combined with that paranoia, and concern for Star if something went wrong here.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star had noticed, obviously, that something was different. Ellesandra wasn't themselves, but to some degree that was to be expected given the night prior. Star kept up some smalltalk during breakfast. The provisions were taken with humble thanks, and hugs were given to both of the elves before departing. They didn't seem to react to the touch. Perhaps they already knew what it was like to touch Star? Either way, she smiled at her companion, concern in her eyes but one that was passive. There were other things to focus on at the moment, and time to talk on the road. She nodded. "The guard is gathering at the gate. We should head there. The departure will begin in an hour or so, so we're in no rush to be among the group, but there might be an address to hear before that." Star then began to lead the way to the gate, with Ellesandra in tow. But along the way, well, she couldn't help but ask: "...Is...Everything all right, Ellesandra? I mean, aside from the obvious from last night. You seem...On edge." More than seem, she could see it. "Is it just worries about the fight ahead of us?"

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra watched the hugs with eyebrows raised. So many people were okay just randomly touching someone they hardly knew; Ellesandra couldn't understand it. Even before the incident, only a rare few were allowed to get close and hug Ellesandra like that. She shook her head, following Star towards the gate and keeping her eye out, when Star asked about her being on edge. "I -" To say she had dreams of something in the shadows? Biting her lip, she glanced sideways at Star, then back to the road ahead of them. "I have a gut feeling something bad might happen, so I'm on guard." It wasn't a lie, persay. It wasn't the whole truth either, though, and Ellesandra knew that Star would be able to tell that. Even without the ability to see emotions, Ellesandra was being too paranoid and guarded to just have a 'bad gut feeling'. Specifically, Ellesandra was watching the shadows, not specific people. She had a bad gut feeling that the shadow wasn't just a dream, considering it had been in two different dreams now. She had a bad feeling it meant more, though Ellesandra didn't know what exactly. Maybe the threat wouldn't be today at all, maybe it would be later, but she wasn't going to let her guard down and have it appear from the shadows without her knowing.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star could very easily tell that the answer was deflective. She frowned. She could see that there was more to the answer, though it did seem to be at least hinting at the truth. The unease she could see in the knight was a solid indication of that much. "I don't suppose you'd care to elaborate? If you have something in mind, it might be prudent to share. Something that I might be able to keep an eye out for as well. I don't expect much to go wrong today but...If I can know of any potential dangers, even if it's just a feeling...Two pairs of eyes are better than one. I take...Your worries seriously, you know. Not that I need any more reason to look out for my own self-preservation, but you being distracted could cause its own problems. If I know what you're worried about, I'll be able to watch and call out to you." A specific decision to frame it as her looking to Ellesandra for help, rather than facing the danger herself. She certainly seemed to have taken Ellesandra's fears seriously.

Ellesandra 
She pursed her lips together. Damnit, Star was making sense. Sighing, she looked around again to ensure no one could just overhear. It felt a little childish, admitting she was on edge because of dreams. "I've had...bad dreams the past two nights. It's not unusual; I do have recurring nightmares, but they both involved something completely new this time. A shadow that seemed to imply you were in danger. The first night it did, anyways. Last night, it was just...following me. Everywhere I went, it was there, somewhere in the shadows, watching. The first night I thought was just a strange nightmare, but that the same shadow was there for a second night in an entirely different dream, not recurring, has me concerned it might be something magical and not just imaginative." There was concern that Star would just laugh at her for being scared of her dreams, but it was minor. If she was then - who gave a damn, right? Ellesandra was taking her job seriously, and right now that seemed to be a potential, real threat. She was going to treat it as such and if she were more paranoid than normal on a day they were potentially marching into a battle, well, that wasn't really a bad thing was it?

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star frowned at the revelation. "...Hm. I recall Nina telling me she had similar experiences in the past. I had thought it was related to her trauma, however, as neither of us ever encountered such a thing in our travels. But for you to experience it too...It can't be a coincidence. Tell me, did the shadow wield a scythe? That was the only other detail that Nina conveyed to me as significant." Hardly one to laugh at the news, Star was clearly taking it very seriously, and would have even if not for the past correlation. "I don't want to make you feel I'm dismissing your concerns, and I'll certainly be on the lookout too...But I hope it's reassuring to hear that we were traveling for years and didn't encounter such a being, whatever it was. It might be an entity that is contained within dreams, but...I'd rather not speculate with so little information."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra came up to a halt when Star mentioned the scythe. She turned concerned eyes onto Star, reaching out to stop Star from walking as well with a brief touch to her arm and ensure they faced eachother. "The scythe didn't make an appearance last night, but the night before it did. It was going to cut you clean in two. And said that you were in danger and would die on your journey." Had her and Nina, Star's previous guardian, had encounters with the same creature? Why was the creature warning Star's guardians but not her? She crossed her arms, eyes narrowing at Star herself. For a brief moment, there had been suspicion that it was Star's doing, but she quickly waved that away. While technically possible, she couldn't imagine Star manipulating someone like that. And Star didn't know Marigold, so how would she have been able to see that in order to play on those emotions in the dream? Unless Star could see more than she'd let on...suspicion rose again, but was shoved down. "It might be reassuring that in years you two didn't encounter it, but the fact it reached out to both your previous guardian and myself is more than coincidence, Star."

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
Star nodded. "I'm certainly not delighted by that news either," she said, showing a flash of...Concern? Fear? A bit of both. "Like I said. I will be vigilant. I'd dismissed the danger before, but I can see that whatever it is has some interest in those around me, if not specifically me myself. I'll be on guard." She did seem a bit shaken, but it had been clear many times over that Star wasn't one to let fear grip her. She sought to master her own emotions, after all, and serenity and calm were literally exuded from her very aura, so any actual show of fear was rare from her thus far. She stayed in place as long as Ellesandra did, not wanting to rush them if they wanted to discuss further. "I won't let any pirates have my head, neither will I a dark spectre. If it is a threat...We will face it together, and I will support you. I won't face it alone, if it is something to be faced. I hope you'll take the same stance."

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra felt even more disturbed, now that she knew this wasn't limited to just her own dreams. The image of of the shadow's scythe cutting towards marigold, then star, then marigold, then star - the pain from last night seeped out of that hole, just a little and Ellesandra winced at the imagery that came into her mind. No, she wasn't going to let the reminder cause her to focus on those emotions again. A deep breath was taken, before she nodded and began walking again. "Well, my job is your protection, so I expect you to run and trust me not to martyr myself if I tell you to run." She didn't actually expect Star to do that. She hoped Star would, but did she trust Star to put her own life over potentially Ellesandra's? No. She fully expected Star would disobey a request like that and knock her over the head for even making it, but Ellesandra would at the very least try, in a situation like that. They hadn't really fought together enough, or at all minus that initial interaction when Ellesandra first stumbled upon Star, for Ellesandra to feel comfortable and like they were a team in battle. It would be a while, before that happened most likely. "Just try not to exhaust yourself so much I need to carry you out of danger though." A teasing note, to lighten the mood.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
"I do trust you. And I trust you not to tell me to leave unless it's an absolute last resort. You're not allowed to die on me, either," she said, meeting their demand with her own. Obviously neither one could help it if death came for them with overwhelming force. But the understanding the two were trying to find with one another was to do all they could to live. Both had seen too much death of the ones filling the opposite role, even if that amount was a single, irreplaceable person. She then smiled at the teasing note. "Emergencies only, promise, even if you do give a good piggy-back ride," she said, raising a hand up as if swearing an oath on the matter as her smile grew. With that settled, and the mood a tiny bit lighter, she moved along with Ellesandra to the gate. It was time to make their move. And move they would; the gathering at the gate was an impressive number of soldiers. Enough to vaguely match the numbers of the pirates, based on estimations. Walking around the city and seeing what sort of ship the pirates had, there were in the ballpark of fifty pirates, not counting the five dead ones. Looking around, there were just about thirty five elves gathered, most of which had both a longbow and a shortsword for armaments. Three of these elves were wearing green robes instead of leather armor, identifying them as the healers. Star moved to stand with them; around them was Ellesandra's company, seven elves with simple spears and iron kite shields, as well as longbows. The rear guard seemed more specifically focused on close combat, with the remaining elves looking specifically geared for longer range combat. A few at the front were donning half-plate with two sheathed shortswords. Not a siege army by any measure, but certainly a force to be reckoned with. The directions were delivered by an older, though gracefully aged elven man who spoke of sanctity of the grove, and many of the points that Star had touched on, with callout specifically to how they had harmed a respected member of the grove in Lissana. The knowledge that one of their own had been harmed did seem to ignite a fire in the standing men and women, which was unlikely to surprise given the communal nature of this settlement. There was discussion that the elite guard would remain at the grove to keep the civilians secure, delivered with a line about not fretting for home while purging the lawless threats of their neighbors. Of course, the entire speech was delivered in elvish, so there was a chance Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it! Star certainly did, keeping a smile about her as she listened. But before long, the speech was over, and the group was on the move. Orders were relayed, the group split into smaller teams and moved together, with a few select individuals lugging large packs, presumably of supplies and/or food. One of the elven men standing at the front stayed back to join with the others of the rear guard, presumably the team commander. He specifically nodded to Ellesandra, acknowledging them as part of the fighting force, but didn't give any specific instruction other than motioning for the rear guard and the healers to follow. The guardsman naturally took up position both in front and behind the healers, ensuring they were the most heavily protected; the bulk of the forward force was the general forces, so most of the rear guard stayed behind to keep the squishy healers surrounded. As standard as things came, if it wasn't for the threat of the shadow that had Ellesandra so paranoid, it might even border on boring.

Ellesandra 
Ellesandra nodded, accepting what Star said. She had no plan to just off and die for no reason, if she could avoid the death. She quickly identified which group was the healers, and followed Star over to them. Her eyes roamed the rear guard, sizing up all of the elves there while the speech was being made. Not knowing elven, Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it. Well, okay she might have caught one or two words just from hearing them multiple times in travel, but nothing to actually understand what was being said. The nod from the team commander caused a nod to be given in return, and Ellesandra moved to walk off to the side. Staying with Star directly would look like a lack of trust in the guards and would likely impede on her ability to interact with the other healers and make any plans necessary there; they needed to meet and trust one another and such for what might be coming up. The same could be said for Ellesandra and the rest of the rear guard, but she didn't try to integrate with them. A well formed company didn't need a stray mercenary stepping in and ruining any of their organization. Ellesandra instead walked off to the side, where she could easily see Star and get to her if something were to happen, but also keep an eye out around them. With the threat of the shadow, Ellesandra kept her guard up despite the number of soldiers around. None of them were looking for something in the shadows, but Ellesandra - and maybe Star - were. So for the entire trip, Ellesandra lightly rested her hand on her rapier and watched, used to long treks like this.

Ellesandra 
// I'm sorry, but I'm getting a really bad headache and think I need to step away for a bit. Please feel free to go ahead and send a post, but I might need to call it on my end for any responses today.

<h1>Star Lumina</h1>
The trip took until dusk. There were multiple organized stops for the soldiers to take half an hour to tend to personal business in the woods, rest their feet, and take some time to eat. There was no point arriving exhausted and dying. Everyone had to be alert on arrival, and the instructions given ensured they would be. Star seemed content to chat with the other elves, though she did so in elvish, as seemed to be the preferred language for obvious reasons. A confirmation that Star did indeed speed more than just common. She was ever the social butterfly, though even in elvish it would easy to pick up on the shy mannerisms of the mystic. Eager to be close to others and be merry, but with that selfsame demure attitude. Star did look around at times, and was sure to check in with Ellesandra during the rest stops. Just to confirm they hadn't seen anything, and to assess their emotional state. Nothing unusual there, or during the entire trip. So it came. The moment of assault. The town was cloaked in the fading light of the nearly set sun, people were returning to their homes. A small contingent of elves moved from the main force and into the city, bows at the ready and arrows nocked. They clung to the walls, moved through the shadows. An initial force that capitalized on the element of surprise, seeking to find locations and take out targets of opportunity in the city. The healers, including Star, set up off the main road in a medium sized clearing with easy access from the road, but the elvish spellcasters cast some magic upon the other edges of the clearing which raised thorny vines up through the gaps in the trees, sealing the clearing to a single entry while allowing in an emergency for the spell to be undone and retreat into the forest. Naturally, the rear guard commander calmly issued orders to his force to station around the entrance to the clearing, but out of sight. Vigilant, but not telegraphing the location. Two of them ascended up into trees to conceal themselves and act as scouts, some others took up posts amidst the trees. The captain instructed Ellesandra and two other elves to act as ones who would receive, guard, and direct wounded back to the guarded clearing. This also ensured that Ellesandra would have view over the city, as the port city was on mildly lower elevation by the water than its surrounding landscape. Just as when approaching from the south, Ellesandra would have a view over a good portion of the city, its port, and the ships in port. Decently far away, to be certain. But that distance didn't stop the knight from feeling...Something. Something sinister lurked. Something dark. The creeping dread of the shadow was theirs to feel, despite the shadow being nowhere to be seen around them. Focusing on the feeling, it certainly did seem to be coming from the city. More specifically, somewhere amidst the pier, on one of the boats. Far enough away that it could not pose a true threat. But the sensation was the same. Was Ellesandra just being paranoid? Was it some trick? Some spell cast on them? It could be a million different things. But that distant, foreboding feeling was not coming from within. Something else was making the knight's spine tingle, making their skin rise with goosebumps..
