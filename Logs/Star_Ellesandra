<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Through Ellesandra's travels they had doubtlessly encountered many faces good and bad; for them to hear the commotion of banditry in progress might be as familiar as the pleasant birdsong of a morning in these forested lands. "Oi! Get back here, girly! We ain't done wit'cha yet!" came the gruff voice of one man, dulled through the trees. Another voice cackled alongside the first. "Kekekeh, what'ssamatter? We ain't gonna hurt'cha, s'long as ya giz all your coin!" Then, a third voice. A womanly yelp. It was close by, but difficult to see through the tree-line. The main road did not have a clear path, so dashing through the underbrush was the most direct route. No other people could be seen along the road as it stretched north-south; the yelp of a woman in peril came from the east. Another voice then echoed. Male, like the other gruff ones: "A-ta-ta-ta, easy, girlie, ain't getting away that easy! We got'cha now, so why dun'ya give up nice and easy. We'll also be takin' that pretty silk dress o' yours, o'course.."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was aimless. She was wandering, following road to town then another road to another town. Usually she picked up a job on the way, but no one in particular was travelling this way so this time, she was alone. Armor plated feet made that particular metallic noise upon each step down the dirt path, her eyes ahead and taking in the sights of the roads. Might as well enjoy the environment on her trip, right? That was, until she heard voices off in the distance, in the trees to the side of the road. Ellesandra came up to a stop, head tilting and listening. The voice of a few men, seeming to be trying to encourage someone to give them coin filtered through the trees. Despite this, Ellesandra didn't start moving, not into the sound of a womanly yelp came out. Ellesandra's left hand moved to rest on the rapier hilt on her right hip, taking a few steps forwards towards the trees and the underbrush. A glance was given down both directions of the road, and the other side of the road behind her; a cursory scan to ensure that this wasn't some ploy to trap her or get her surrounded or distracted. Not that anyone had reason to target her, but it wasn't unheard of for bandits to use the idea of a damsel in distress to trap someone else, too. Confirming that there was no immediate danger behind her, she eyed the right places to step and quickly moved through the underbrush, taking long strides that skipped as much ground as possible with intentionally placed steps to ensure that she didn't step on any traps that may have been left and hidden within the obscured brush. She ignored the pricks of foliage that brushed against her, stepping through into the small clearing that the bandits, and the woman, was. At least three men, and then the apparent damsel. Ellesandra didn't look particularly imposing, height wise. She was short at 5'1, though wearing an ornate looking white breastplate with carvings and designs on it, abnormal for someone to wear if they ever expected to get hit in it. A plate skirt, matched this, going down to mid thigh where it met long, gauntleted boots to protect the remainder of her legs. Black tights were worn beneath, both to cover the skin open to the air and prevent the metal from resting against it directly. Long, white hair was currently hanging down to her mid back, natural waves and curls in it. Typically if she were expecting a fight it would be worn up in a ponytail, though she hadn't been about to stop to put it up before stepping in. Blue eyes stood out from a pale skinned face, quickly taking in the situation. She did not immediately draw her blade, but would take a few steps to circle the situation, steps that would take her closer to the woman, but not quite in-between them yet. "Gentlemen, any chance I can persuade you to depart with your lives?" Words were spoken coldly, and straight to the point, with a stoic face that took years of practice to master. She looked almost bored, as if she didn't truly care about the outcome of this encounter. Her eyes reflected the dead feelings inside of her, but there were so many feelings that weren't being shown. Guilt was overwhelming, one that almost encompassed the rest of them and made them hard to feel. The guilt alone was pressing down the sadness, grief, depression. The only feeling that competed with the guilt was anger, though this was partially directed at herself so the anger and guilt blended together in many aspects. Rising up to the surface, the caution and suspicion at her current predicament, paranoia that this was a trap, and also irritation at these bandits for even making this an issue if it were a real situation. Preying on a lone traveler was weak and cowardly, and the irritation was making itself known.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Checking their surroundings, Ellesandra found nothing but empty road and a midday horizon greeting them in both directions. Unless the stray squirrel they spied on the tree behind them was secretly an evil-doer posing as a woodland critter, there was no trap to be found. Indeed, as they stepped through the underbrush, they came to find the situation exactly as it would be expected as they stepped into a clearing amidst the trees that sported trodden earth and patchy grass. Three bandits, each sporting red bandanas, scruffy beards, and less-than-pristine scimitars that had bitten the wood of ship decks as much as they had their pray. Pirates, it seemed, standing at various heights hovering around six feet, and all looking decently conditioned by their pirate lifestyle. Striped white and red sea-fairing shirts with suspender-bearing pants that were tattered and torn from the life at sea. A nearby port town to the north-east explained their presence here, though that remained a town yet to be visited by the knight. The three of them turned to look at the knightly woman when they arrived. They stood in a triangular formation, surrounding another woman. This woman looked entirely out of place among these ruffians, which was likely what led to this situation in the first place. A bit taller than Ellesandra at five-five. Long, flowing white hair pure as an untrodden snowfall. Bright, vibrant blue eyes that were as if the sky and the sea brought to bear their vastness to express the gentle soul of the woman they belonged to. Almost mesmerizing in their striking beauty, or they might be if not for the distracting red wound on the woman's cheek. A gash, likely from one of the pirate blades. It looks to have clotted, but the red streaks down her cheek were fresh and slowly drying. Further evidence of this wound could be seen on Star's dress. A bright, beautiful white and light-blue garment with exuberant frills and feathery adornments along the rim of its brassiere, with sheer fabric visible below the flowy skirt. A dress fit for a princess, even if Star was anything but. Star, despite being surrounded by these evil-doers, did not look exceptionally fearful. Adrenaline was clearly working through her. But it was not the face of an entirely helpless damsel. Just a woman who, even if they did know how to fight, was still very much in danger. The three pirates turned to the knight, the two that were facing Star turned their backs to her to face Ellesandra. The other was already facing them. "Ey? What's this, little lady? C'mon, now, no need for you t' get mixed up in all 'is, then, is there? Move along, we's just seeing to escortin' this 'ere lass to our, ah, protective custody, yeah?" said the first pirate, wearing a grin that showcased some dreadfully rotten and cavitated teeth. "Yeah," chimed in the second. "We'd uh, 'ate to have ta', you know...Get'cha all mixed up in this 'ere...Perfectly legal and legitimate transaction, eh?" he said, wearing a shit-eating grin for his attempt at deception. Star met eyes with Ellesandra when they observed her; she could see the crushing, overwhelming guilt upon them, as well as the anger boiling just under their calm exterior. Star dare not escalate the situation by striking, but...There was a calm readiness in her eyes. A silent signal that she would follow their lead. Star very obviously also did not have a weapon, so one might wonder just what she might have up her sleeve. If she had sleeves, at least. She did not.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra eyed the men who seemed to have ignored that she was well armored and dressed. She carried herself with a practiced, cautious ease. If these men were smart, they would have recognized that she was no mere traveler who just happened to be armed. She'd seen combat; plenty of it. When Ellesandra's eyes met that of the woman, and saw the blood there and along a gown, the irritation turned quickly into anger. It was too similar, seeing this woman on her knees, injured and surrounded by enemies. Her eyes had widened slightly when she looked at the woman, and saw her previous charge, instead. Not literally, of course, but the similarities were enough that her guilt ridden mind easily made a connection, and it took a moment of blinking her image away to reinstate the reality of their current situation. This woman wasn't her Princess, but it did not matter. She had been injured, and Ellesandra was not going to listen to these men's flimsy explanations. With a glance back at the nearest man, her left hand drew her rapier quickly. Her right raised and a light yellow light poured out of it, quickly covering her own body in an enchantment. There were no words spoken for the magic, though it became obvious why she didn't utilize a shield or anything with her rapier, as her right hand had drawn an invisible sigil in the air as the spell took form. Haste, a low powered one currently as these pirates didn't seem like they needed the full extent of the spell and the stronger it was, the bigger the toll it would take on Ellesandra's body. Just enough of a boost to ensure that as she struck, the pirates wouldn't be able to get to their captive. The captive woman looked plenty ready to fight back herself, but Ellesandra wasn't going to risk her own attack causing them to decide to kill the woman instead. With the speed that seemed supernatural to any normal warrior or bandit, her rapier shot out straight for the first man's throat. Ellesandra didn't hold back the killing blow, but whether or not it struck home the rest of her body was moving - grabbing his shirt and hauling him to the side as she stepped in to stand closer to the woman. Close enough that she could defend her if any of the men decided to step in towards her, but wanting to give her enough space to do whatever she had in mind; Ellesandra knew better than to step in between someone about to cast magic or make their own attack and accidentally ruin it or cause them to injure themselves.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirates shifted their stances when the other's weapon was drawn. A fight was inevitable, it seemed. And it was the arrogance of the outlaws that made them all too ill-prepared for what, or rather who, was about to strike them. The magic gave them pause, striking a mild fear into them. But one pirate saw fit to close the distance to try and stop the spell before Ellesandra could weave it. His reaction too slow, the distance too great, and his lifetime of fighting other unskilled pirates did not prepare him for the lethal precision Ellesandra employed. His sword was high, neck exposed as he charged with a battlecry at the knight. His life ended nigh instantly as Ellesandra's rapier pierced his neck, bulging his eyes as his hands grasped with futility at the wound and choked gurgles served as his final words before his lifeless body was discarded, leaving Ellesandra's rapier dripping with his crimson essence. The other two pirates remained too slow to react as Ellesandra took position near Star. Star, then, took the initiative to secure this fight for her knightly protector; she had been swelling magic within her chest while the conversation went on. Time enough for her to be ready upon a hair trigger to do what she planned. Her plan? She shot up to her feet beside Ellesandra, arms thrusting out to either side. A bright blue aura enveloped her as, in that split second of her shooting up, mana exploded outwards from her in the form of a blinding, brilliant light. As bright as the sun, yet Ellesandra would not find the light painful to their eyes. Instead, it was soft. Soothing. A residual white mist lingered around Star and spread out a handful of meters from her to make a swiftly dissipating fog in the aftermath of the spell; breathing deep within this mist would bring with it an emboldening, restorative sensation within Ellesandra, firmly suggesting Star to be the sort of magic user that focused on support and healing as the empowering mist filled Ellesandra's lungs. And, of course, while it empowered Ellesandra? The two remaining pirates were sent reeling back, free hands clutching palms over their eyes as they screamed in agony and blood poured out between their fingers over their eyes. Further evidence that the effect of the blinding flash was selective, given that to the knight it was little more strenuous than walking out into a sunny afternoon field. Wild, aimless swings of their scimitars found nothing as they tried to fight off the knight they knew was...Somewhere near them, ready to end them. Their blindness might be temporary, but given it was on the order of days it truly seemed Ellesandra would hardly have needed to use any magic at all to fell these fools. Doubly so with an ally like Star, though it stood to reason that it was only thanks to Ellesandra's distraction that Star could produce such magic, else she likely would not have ended up trapped in the first place.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had guessed the woman would be using magic of some kind, but she had not expected a brilliant light to appear out of nowhere. Our of instinct, Ellesandra turned her head away from the light and readjusted her position so that she was partially facing the woman, unsure if the woman was fully on her side or not. Still, the light wasn't actually painful to her eyes - something she didn't realize until a moment later - and instead it seemed...soothing. Energizing, really. Yet when she looked up to the pirates, it had obviously hit them differently, unpleasantly based on them seeming to be blinded. The caution and surprise almost filled her emotions, until it was roughly pushed down. Ellesandra could take time later to process what just happened and ask the woman about it. Right now, she was going to take advantage of the situation given. With the two men blinded and swinging their scimitars wildly, it was easy for Ellesandra to step up into range of them and avoid their aimless swings, her still enhanced speed being used to provide them both with a quick end. She could have kept them alive, but the risk of them doing something like this to someone else was too high. So, each of them received the same treatment the first one did; her blade straight through the center of their throat, pulled slightly to the side to ensure it cut into the artery. A quick kill, both depriving of oxygen and a quick bleed out. Not immediate, but close enough. Ellesandra waved her right hand and the haste spell ended on herself even as she turned to look at the woman, blade still drawn. The lethargy from the spell didn't hit as hard this time, considering the restorative magic that had surrounded her from the mage. Not to mention, even as the haste spell ended she could feel the energy from the mage's spell flowing into her in a way the mage probably hadn't expected; the mana of it itself replacing that which Ellesandra had used for her own spell. Ellesandra flicked the tip of her rapier to the side to get rid of most of the blood on it, eyes still on the apparent 'damsel'. She reached back, slipping her hand into a pocket on her bag and pulling out a dirty cloth rag and cleaning the rest of the blood off of the blade, but not speaking. She wanted to see how the woman responded to the men having been killed; she wasn't sure if she would need to defend herself from the mage or not.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The two pirates stood no chance. They had been debilitated. Mercy was an option, but none had shown any degree of remorse in what they were about to do. It was very likely indeed that they would be chasing another to steal from them before long, had they not met their ends. The grass and dirt below was now spattered with sprays and pools of blood. The mana that lingered in the air from Star's spell did very much to soothe and restore the knight before her. With all done, Star's reaction shifted from one of survival, of alert, adrenaline-widened eyes, to...Tears. She slid her arms around her own torso to give herself a self-hug. She bent forward slightly, head slightly hung as she bit her lower lip to try and fight back tears. Small trembles were visible in her frame. Eyes were shut tight. She tried to stifle her sniffles and choked, high-pitched sobs to some degree of success, but whatever was troubling her was still clearly too much for her to bear. Was it just shock? It certainly didn't seem like the first time she'd been in such a situation. So it did beg the question of what could produce such visceral and obvious sorrow in the woman.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra finished cleaning her rapier, eyes still on the woman now...crying. She wasn't quite sure how to approach or make the woman feel better; comforting a stranger was both not something she was comfortable with, or good at. Not to mention, suspicion was still heavily apparent. This could still very well be a trap, a way to ease her into thinking the woman was harmless. After that magic, Ellesandra wasn't going to let her guard down around the woman, at least not entirely. Sliding the rapier back into it's sheath, she stepped back to drag the men to the side and out of sight of the woman at least, since the death of others was likely to be a traumatizing factor if this woman hadn't seen death before. Staring at their dead bodies wouldn't help. It wasn't until after they were moved to the side that Ellesandra stepped back up towards the woman, and spoke. "You're safe now, miss. Did they injure you badly, anywhere?" There had been blood on the woman, though Ellesandra hadn't been able to get a good enough read on how injured she might have been. "I have some medical supplies in my pack, if you need them, but it also seems like you may be able to take care of the injuries via magic if that's easier for you?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had been quietly seeking her center while the knightly woman saw to putting the bodies out of the way in the nearby bushes. The vultures would certainly be along in the days to come if nobody found the corpses to deal with them. Nearby townsfolk would be unlikely to care enough to give these lawless bandits any proper rites. As Star cried, a soft blue aura slowly came over her. It was difficult to discern what the aura signified, but it was similar to the one she had when she attacked prior. Except...It swiftly shifted from its usual azure colour to a tumultuous mix of darker blues, reds, and purples. The colours certainly seemed to hold some sort of meaning, but...To an untrained eye it was little more than just what it was - a multicoloured aura. But as the bodies were tended to, as Star was given time, the colours slowly returned to a steady, azure blue. This coincided with Star's sobs and tears subsiding quite directly, to the point that when the aura was again one uniform colour, she had returned to steady breaths. She wiped at her eyes, taking measured breaths through her mouth to keep herself steady, then looked at Ellesandra when they spoke to her. She managed a half-smile and a nod at the notion of being safe, then a shake of the head at the question of being injured badly. "Just caught my cheek with their blade," she said, finally speaking. She had a gentle voice. Feminine and sweet, though still very subtly shaken. "That's very kind of you to offer. I can handle this small wound myself, though, you're right," she said, then moved one hand up to her own cheek. The tips of her fingers touched the wound, briefly glowing with soft white light once touching the wound. A few seconds of this passed, and when her fingers then removed again from the wound, it had ceased to be, leaving the skin unblemished and without so much as a mark to speak of. The streaks of red, the reminder of where the wound once was, remained, however. There was little sense wasting mana on what a wet cloth could accomplish, in her mind. She then moved her hands to her dress skirt, in all its feathery frills, and pinched either side with either hand to lift as she bowed in a pleasant curtsy to Ellesandra. "Thank you, as well, for coming to my aide. My name is Star Lumina. I typically travel with someone else who acts as my guardian, but..." She raised from the curtsy, then looked away from the other woman as discomfort overtook her face. "They are, erm...Indisposed...For the foreseeable future. I must admit I may have grown too comfortable with the safety that guardianship had afforded me, and thus complacent about how dangerous the realms can be." She returned her gaze to Ellesandra, a tiny blush coming over her cheeks at her honest admission. Despite having clearly powerful magic, she was, without a doubt, out of her depth.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had eyed the magical aura around Star cautiously, but hadn't made a move to stop whatever it was. When she watched the woman seem to gather herself and heard the sweet, feminine voice there was a momentary gut wrenching flashback. Guilt, pain, and grief hit her once again, hard enough that she actively took a step back from Star. Her jaw clenched and she fought it down, reminded herself that this was not the same. This woman - Star, she'd called herself - was not dying. If anything, she was more just traumatized by the experience, most likely. Taking a deep breath to help center her own emotions, Ellesandra nodded.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star noticed the reaction. She had noticed the distrust initially. She noticed it all. She couldn't understand the cause, only that her voice, something about her words, had caused a reaction. The shift of Elesandra's aura, the sudden pulse of heavy matte greys that bore down on them like a boulder. It evoked a sympathetic expression, though such expression would not give away that she could see more than the knight knew she could. "...I might have been able to, I just..." she blushed again, hands folded before her as she looked at the ground before her in...Shame? "I hesitated. Even though those men would have hurt me, I had hoped to get away without causing them harm." She gently shook her head with a sad chuckle. "I must sound pathetic," she said, looking back up to Ellesandra. "I could never ask to burden you with my protection, Miss Rhinelander. But I must...Also concede that it would be a great boon to me." She then pointed past Ellesandra, to the north-east. "...I was heading to Cloverport, just an hour's walk north-east from here, when these pirates intercepted me on the road. The main road just west of here will lead there. Though, erm...That is just a single stop in my journey." She lowered her arm, then took a deep breath and looked at Ellesandra more directly again. "...Perhaps it is foolhardy of me, but...The journey I am undertaking is one that I cannot abandon, no matter the perils I may face. So...Whatever aide you offer to me, I will only be able to selfishly accept." Some guilt, an emotion Ellesandra clearly knew well, overtook Star at that admission. A bold, assertive claim; for better or worse, she would not give up on whatever this quest of hers was.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The woman seemed to blush a lot. Was that attraction, or embarrassment? Ellesandra would assume the latter. Crossing her arms, she stood with her feet wide and looking up slightly at the woman, head tilted to the side. Her eyes were narrowed in what looked like a suspicious gaze, though the suspicion was much lower than it had been when she first encountered the pirates and Star. "I am not sorry for killing them, though I am sorry if my doing so caused you distress, Miss Lumina." The fact Star had hesitated because she hadn't wanted to kill the men was foolish, but Ellesandra fully understood that some people just didn't have it in them - especially some soft mages, like this woman seemed to be. Ellesandra had never seen magic like Star's, but that wasn't surprising; there were many kinds of magic in the world. After Star had commented on her current destination, and implied that it was only one stop on the journey, Ellesandra frowned. "First of all, it is not pathetic to require or admit you need help." A lesson that Ellesandra herself could learn from, but it was easier to give advice than follow it. "Foolish to try not to harm them. Even should you have succeeded in escaping, you would have simply left their next victim to it instead, but that would not have been your fault; only theirs." They turned to look in the direction Star had pointed, north-east, then back to her. "I will accompany you to Cloverport should you have my company, Miss Lumina. From there, I am open to be hired, or you may find another guard to hire on your journey should you prefer it. I would not recommend continuing whatever journey you are on alone."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently shook her head at the notion that the killing distressed her. "You have nothing to apologize for, truly," she said, then lowered her head as the brief lecture took place. Her face was that of a woman who understood all that Ellesandra said, but held a heart that stubbornly resisted the wisdom on offer. "You speak the truth. I know that fools who speak only in violence and refuse to hear reason must be spoken to with equal violence." She sighed, moving one hand to rub at her cheek. Understanding the truth was clearly no problem for her. Acting on it? Well, the intuition that some didn't have it in them was surely only reinforced by her reaction. She reset her posture and nodded to Ellesandra. "I...Am not exactly flush with coin. Hardly able to afford a brilliant knight as yourself, but...I appreciate your kindness in escorting me at least that far." She smiled. A quiet fear lingered behind her smile for what the future would bring, but her thankfulness was clear. Indeed, it was...Remarkably easy to discern Star's feelings at just a glance. To say she wore her heart on her sleeve didn't cut it - she held her heart out in both hands for all to see clearly, plainly, without needing to read deeper. Be it happiness, embarrassment, anger, sadness...Her face, her body language, was all unusually animated to the point that this woman had zero hope of ever hiding her true feelings from anyone who paid attention. A grinning, silver-tongued rogue she most certainly was not; such an image was her absolute antithesis.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra huffed softly, closing her eyes and then letting out a resigned sigh. She wouldn't say it, or offer it yet, but the idea of continuing with Star had already come into her head. Could she let this woman go off on her own for whatever misadventure and stubborn ideas she had in mind? It'd be all but letting her die, and it wasn't as if Ellesandra had anywhere else in specific to be. Still, she wasn't going to make that offer now; perhaps after seeing Star to the next town, and getting a better understanding of her and potentially her goal. Wiping her hands off in front of her, a physical attempt to wipe off the thought of killing those men and shrug it off, Ellesandra nodded towards the road. "Well, unless you need anything else here, we might as well get onto the road, Miss Lumina." Ellesandra would motion with a hand for Star to take the lead. "I will be right behind you and will ensure no one else might be around waiting for these three to return." It was possible; if these weren't their own small band of bandits they might have come from some local group that would be looking if they didn't return quickly. Ellesandra still had a stoic, cold look on their face, having not smiled once during their interaction. If anything, she looked tired - though that certainly wasn't a physical exhaustion.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently nodded to the notion that they should leave. She moved back the way she was being chased. Not a fully trodden road, but a wilderness path that had seen some foot traffic regularly enough to stomp down the underbrush to easily passed terrain existed. Nature-walkers likely made frequent passage. The walk along it wasn't terribly long, some ten minutes before they were back on the road properly. No other pirates could be seen passing or coming up behind them, though given the proximity to Cloverport, Ellesandra's vigilance wasn't unwarranted. Star allowed Ellesandra to take either the lead, the side, or behind her, whichever they felt most appropriate for escort. The town of Cloverport was vaguely visible on the horizon; a port-side town connected to a horseshoe-shaped lake that connected outward into the greater ocean. The rounded cove had natural defenses, and smaller encampments with ballistae defenses and guard towers could be seen dotting the edge of the lake. A mercantile hub, one that clearly had the potential to send pirate ships to the bottom of the ocean. So it begged the question of why these pirates had been ignored, to any astute onlooker. That all aside, they had a bit of walking to do, and no company but each other and the nearby woodland critters. Star stole occasional glances at Ellesandra, as if...Studying them. Then, set eyes forward with some pensive look upon her, only to look back at the knight again, once again studying them with curiosity, even if that meant rather obviously looking over her shoulder at them.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had followed along behind while in the woods so as to keep a better eye on Lumina, a duty that she took seriously now that she had agreed to take it on. When they got out to the road, she waited until Lumina began walking in the direction of the town to confirm it was the right direction before moving to fall into step beside Lumina. Ellesandra's caution was still up, especially considering what they'd just encountered; she kept her eye out and glanced around to the surrounding woods, behind them towards where they'd come from, and then down to the port city. If pirates had come from there, either they'd gone under the radar - which would be hard with how they were dressed - or the port city supported them in some way, which would make it quite dangerous as well. She looked over to Star, catching the woman studying her again, and let out a soft sigh. "If you have questions Miss Lumina, ask. There is no reason to to walk in silence if you have things to discuss." While Ellesandra herself was not much of a conversationalist, she also knew that after a situation like what just happened, having a conversation could help distract the woman from the trauma. Not only that, but get to know Ellesandra well enough to trust her with her protection. Ellesandra had just killed three men in front of her; it was entirely possible Star was thinking she was some cold blooded killer. She couldn't do her job well if Star didn't let her in or trust her with accurate information about their goals and destination.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was hardly surprised that she got caught staring. She wasn't being very subtle, after all. She scratched at her cheek, showing another flush of embarrassment for being called out on it. "S-Sorry," she began. "I don't mean to make you uncomfortable or anything, just..." She paused here, focusing on Ellesandra for a short while. Eyes that seemed to peer into Ellesandra's very soul. Indeed, she very well might be. She then shook her head. "I don't wish to pry into your personal matters. So please...Feel free to pretend I've said nothing at all...But I simply cannot ignore the weight I see bearing down on your shoulders. As if a mountain rests upon each of your pauldrons. I know it isn't my place, but...I cannot help that my heart tugs in my chest upon seeing it." She offered a smile at the conclusion of her words. A sympathetic smile. "I'm sure there are a thousand lighter topics to fill the air with as we walk...But the least I can do after being saved by you is offer you my ear, if talking might at all ease the weight. I know things are hardly so simple...But I can't help but extend the offer regardless."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't know what she had expected, but being asked about the 'weight on her shoulders' was not one of them. She'd thought Star was shy and wanted to get to know her, not that she could see through to Ellesandra's soul. Could she? Ellesandra frowned, the defensiveness and caution rising again. She also seemed to pull within herself, walls raising to protect herself from the question. "There is no mountain." Her voice came out in a snap, harsh and discordant. It was unintentional, not having intentionally set out to be rude to Star, but the fact that they had JUST met and she was prying into something she very much did not earn information to? Ellesandra closed herself up, jaw clenching and eyes focused straight forward rather than looking over to Star and seeing how her harsh words might have effected her. "And nothing to lend an ear for. I am here to ensure you get to Cloverport, not to share my life story." She wanted to clench her fists, to cross her arms, to distance herself more from Star, but she restrained that. She didn't want to intimidate the woman into not feeling comfortable with her, and distancing herself didn't make sense when it was her job to ensure she was safe. It was best to stay close for that purpose. She opened her mouth to ask Star a question of her own, just to redirect the topic, but then closed it. She didn't know what to ask, and didn't feel like it was appropriate to do so if she herself had just denied truly answering a question asked of her.

Perhaps surprisingly, Star didn't react poorly to Ellesandra closing off. Her smile remained, and her expression quietly spoke of how the response was expected. Her eyes also showed knowledge that refuted Ellesandra's lies. No mountain, they insisted, as Star saw it plain as day crumbling down upon their shoulders in crashing waves of grey and black, like tar clinging to them and making every movement twice as weighted. "I did say I aimed not to pry, and you were welcome to pretend I'd said nothing," she said, keeping her smile. Her eyes returned forward, then, as she continued. "Allow me, then, to give a bit more context to my journey, so you might have something to listen to as we walk." She kept her eyes forward. Her expression showed a smile, a force of strength. But there was a pain that lingered under that smile, shown with a plain openness that stood a firm foil to Ellesandra's closed off stance. "Humour me for a moment, if you will, and consider what you might know to be the rarest magic you've ever known. Even if you aren't exposed to much of the world of magic, I'm sure a knight like yourself has come to see some things more common than others. A fireball is perhaps the most ubiquitous magic there is. That would fall under the school of 'Evocation'. Evoking the forces of nature, of the elements. Controlling flames, winds, lightning, all things of that sort. Next you might consider more esoteric magics like...Teleportation, revival, necromancy. Still common enough, their power and nature notwithstanding, to be known on the common tongue. Take a step further, and you might get into magic that is known only to a select group of people, like druidic magic. Step further, and you enter the world of mystics. People whose magic starts to become as unique as the individual themselves. And when we arrive into that circle, that's, well...About where you might find me. Where other magic users might have dozens, hundreds of other magi, and thousands of books to reference about others like them that have come before that wielded the same magic as them..." She paused again, taking in a slow breath. "...There's only one other person in the whole world who I've ever known that has the same magic as me. And it is imperative that I find them again, not only to hope to preserve this magic of ours, but also, to a smaller extent, for my own sake. For closure, and for the potential betterment of my own understanding of myself, and my magic. If they are still alive, they are the only person who can guide me on using my magic to its fullest. And if they are dead...Then..." She struggled to form the words that encapsulated her feelings on this matter. "...Then I need to know. Because I cannot move on until I do."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't know what to say as Star pointed out that she could have just ignored the question. It was true, she could have, but her instinct had been to snap back. Push the woman away to make her think asking about that wasn't acceptable. The right thing to do probably would have just been ignoring her, but she was never quite so good at ignoring her emotions in instinct. In time she could repress them, surely, but that just made her angry overall. A deep breath was taken, not looking over at Star or seeing the pain in her eyes at all. In fact, Ellesandra looked everywhere EXCEPT at Star, knowing she'd probably gone too far with the harsh words. Yet, the mage had continued on to explain things as if they hadn't been harsh at all. "I certainly haven't seen magic like yours before." Ellesandra admitted, taking the bone Star had thrown her in regards to the topic change. There being only one other person in the world who had the same type of magic was probably frustrating when it came to learning it, and perhaps they were even family? Didn't unique magic lines tend to run through family blood? It sounded like a lonely journey, if Star was taking this search on her own. "Is this person you are looking for the guardian you mentioned?" She had mentioned having a guardian who was no longer available. The way it had been phrased was suspicious at the time, though if Star didn't know what happened to them and was searching for them that would explain it. She likely wouldn't want to admit the person might be dead, but also didn't want to hope otherwise. That's how Ellesandra would feel, anyways. The tension had reduced a little, listening to Star speak and asking questions in return. She was still more guarded than even when she first saw Star and the pirates, the question having certainly put her guard up, but it was quickly relaxing back to normal again. The soft clunk of her metal boots hitting the dirt beneath them, along with where her breastplate met her skirt, was a familiar accompanying sound to her walking and pacing.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"No, not that guardian I mentioned. That guardian's name is Nina. She's an old friend. And half the reason my first instinct to talk about common magics is fireballs," she said with a giggle. "Nina is a kind soul. And a fiery one. Quite literally. She possesses a soul touched by a powerful phoenix, so when I say she is indisposed, well...I mean to say she was killed. I didn't want to start with that because it sounds grim, but that phoenix within her means that she returned to life from her own ashes. A taxing process, but one she will recover from in due time. Alas, that is time I cannot remain idle, hence you finding me on my lonesome," she said, keeping her tone spirited through her words. Truly, as much as it did mean Star did very much need help for the foreseeable future, it was surely heartening to know that her dear friend wasn't truly gone. "In a year or so, she may be able to serve as my guardian again. But in truth? Part of me wishes to allow her to pursue her own life. I don't wish to shackle her with my woes, much as I'm certain she wouldn't characterize it like that," she said, giggling again. A fondness for this friend was obvious. But the two were far, far apart now. "No, the person I'm looking for is, erm...My mother." Star's tone dropped to a more sorrowful one with those words. She couldn't know how close Ellesandra was to guessing the truth before she said it. But it did certainly explain the struggles Star had with the topic. "Her name is Aurora Lumina, not that I expect anyone here to know that name. We are...Not in the right realm for anyone to know her. In fact, the first step of my journey, before I can even begin to try and find her again is...Finding a way to return home, to where I was born. To where my mother most likely is, whether she still lives or not. A far more difficult task than simply finding the path on a map and walking it, I'm afraid."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra finally glanced back at Star when she mentioned her friend, Nina, had died. Even if she was a phoenix and apparently returning to life, in some form or fashion, losing a friend couldn't be great. "Sorry to hear." Ellesandra's words were soft, spoken with a pain and sympathy of one who has known loss. And unfortunately for Ellesandra, this loss wasn't one that returned to life after a time. Looking back forwards, Ellesandra rested her right hand on the top of her rapier hilt while they walked, thumb and finger lightly tapping into the metal in a tick that she didn't even realize she had, but one that provided comfort for her all the same. "I've not heard of this Mrs. Lumina." Ellesandra confirmed in regards to not knowing the name. The right realm comment made Ellesandra glance sideways to her again before she continued. "So do you have a specific destination in which you will be able to return to your own realm? Also, if I may ask, you mentioned needing to find your mother in order to ensure your magic doesn't die out. Would you not be able to sustain your magic by having kids of your own, or is your magic not passed down via blood?" She paused, then quickly added. "If you don't mind sharing. I understand many mages, especially those of particularly unique blood lines, are sensitive to the secrets their magic may carry. I have no desire to pry into it." Ellesandra herself was a simple spellsword; she was capable of other magics, but not talented at it. The only unique magic she had was that of being able to reutilize the mana, energy within a spell; to absorb it, though she had never known where that particular ability came from.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star sputtered at the notion of her having children. Her face was now emulating the ripest of tomatoes. "W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Well...A-Ah, uhm, you see, I...Uhm...That is...Aaah...Uhm..." This stammering continued for a short while. She tapped her index fingers together, idly spun some of her snow-white hair around one index, and idly fidgeted with her hands in general while trying to answer that question. "...I-It is, well, passed through lineage, s-so, that much is true! B-But the ideal would s-still be that I, erm...H-Have a little guidance on the matter before I go...Thinking about...T-That..." Her words quieted to a whisper by the end of that. There was other matters to discuss, but the notion of children had thrown Star for such a loop that the rest got lost in translation, and now she was just...Silently steaming in her own head while waiting for the knight's reply, still as bright red in the cheeks as could be.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected the notion of kids to fluster the mage so. She looked over and for the briefest of seconds, amusement passed through them. There was even a very small uptick to the corner of their mouth at the sight of Star stammering and going red enough that she looked like steam would come out of her ears. Looking forward, Ellesandra spoke again. "My apologies, Miss Lumina. I did not intend to embarrass you or imply kids were your only option. Many people eschew such things, or are incapable of creating such, and there would be no shame in such." Ellesandra wasn't sure if Star was simply inexperienced and thus flustered at the concept, or if it was embarrassment for a reason such as being unable to. It didn't matter; apparently the topic had been quite intense for Star, so Ellesandra felt the need to apologize. The amusement had faded quickly, only showing briefly, but it did lighten Ellesandra's mood a little. Her guard was still up, but it wasn't being held up firmly; it was more that Ellesandra's natural state was to have it up as she went about her daily life.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star needed a bit of time to recoup from that, but her blush was going to be sustained for a little while as she tried to move those thoughts out of her mind to refocus on other topics. She gently shook her head. "N-No, it's okay. It's not your fault. I-I suppose I just, well, had never really focused on that quite as much. N-Not even so much romantic prospects, l-let alone.." She shook her head again, more vigorously this time. A soft huff followed as she sought composure once more. She wasn't about to go on to say how she was perfectly capable, or so she assumed, or other embarrassing subjects about herself with this woman she'd just met, mostly because it would be a little too much information, so she sought to pivot. "A-Anyway...U-Uhm." Deep breath. "I, er...I want to understand myself, first and foremost, is I suppose the point I'm getting at. Not that I'm...Going to turn away from any romantic prospects that might arise, but for the moment I have a clear direction that has made maintaining long-standing friendships...Difficult. There are many who are not cut out for a vagrant life rife with dangers, and there's no shame in that. I just...Hope to brighten the lives of those I encounter, when I do encounter them, you know?" She asked with a smile. The two were getting closer to the city. The sun was still high in the sky, so there were plenty of hours of daylight left for them to make use of. Another ten or so minutes of walking and they would hit the outskirts.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had to bite back her initial response of calling Star on her...inexperience. Not calling so much, but commenting on it and calling her flustered attitude cute. It wasn't appropriate, or needed from a stranger. Instead, she looked off towards the outskirts of the town, keeping an eye out even as they approached. If those pirates had come from here, it was entirely possible there were more. "It is entirely valid to want to find yourself before finding a partner or considering children. And admirable that you recognize it may not be the best time to actively search, Miss Lumina." Her words had gone back to the formal way of speaking, which for her was a more relaxed situation compared to when she'd snapped at the mage. Still, Ellesandra would change the topic - both for Star to not get too embarrassed, and also to redirect their thoughts to the path ahead. "We are near the city and have daylight to burn. Did you have a plan upon arriving, a ship you were intending to get on? If not, I would recommend finding a place to stay for the night before travelling on to the next location, we're far enough along in the day that starting off now wouldn't be entirely wise, especially considering the attack that already happened on this road."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star showed the appreciation in her face at the change of topic. Some time for her to cool off. She nodded to the question about a plan. "Mmn. There's someone in town I'm meeting. I was told they might have information about how to get to the next leg of my journey. I...Somehow doubt it will be a straight forward affair, and may not be without its cost, but...I will figure something out once I meet them. I was referred to someone named Morrun Dayflower. A high elven scholar who had some information about a lead I was chasing. All sounds very vague, I'm sure, but when we sit down with him I'm sure it'll make more sense. I don't intend on getting on a ship, though, no. Unless the next destination requires it. And I do have enough money for a night at an inn, assuming they are keeping reasonable prices, if we need to stay around. That being said, if the pirates are making this place a home, I might sooner find camp among the trees if there are no storm clouds this night. Not that I don't feel infinitely safer around someone like you, but, I would not shackle you to a night if you have somewhere else to be," she said, offering a genuine smile at Ellesandra. "I'm not one for needless conflict, regardless. The sight of death disturbs me greatly, even if I know in my mind it was righteously done."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was surprised, and considered commenting, on Star's use of 'we'. Was she taking for granted that Ellesandra would accompany her for such? She had only technically agreed to see her to the city safely, though Star had a good point that if the city was overtaken by pirates it might be safer to sleep outside of the city. After listening to the rest, she decided not to call Star out on her assumption that Ellesandra would join her. For now, she would. Instead she ran the name Morrun Dayflower through her mind to figure out if she had heard of them. She hadn't, but she'd met many a mage in one of her last jobs and sometimes had to focus on trying to think of them and who all she met. "What exactly was your plan, if you were to run out of money? Surely you didn't expect to be able to find your mother so quickly on limited funds, if you're at the point of commenting about having enough money to stay the night at an inn." Typically, that was a given for travelers. If Star were so hard up on coin to make that an active consideration, Ellesandra couldn't imagine how she was planning to finish her journey entirely on her own. "And you mentioned a cost from this Morrun for getting you to the right realm as well." They added in consideration for that. Was Star just going on a whim and hoping things fell into place? Ellesandra felt both an irritation at such foolishness, and a protectiveness of the naivety of it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gently shook her head. "I've always been able to find work healing. It's just been a long road since I was in a major settlement. I admit there are times I will pass up compensation for what I do when I'm in a squalid town. There's little joy in taking from those who live in houses with roofs in disrepair that catch the rainwater in pots, and have to grovel to the local lords come time for tax collection, even if I myself am hard off. A place like Cloverport is sure to have more work for me; I simply meant to say that extortionist prices aren't worth the comfort when I am well-enough accustomed to life among nature," she said, hoping her correction put things in better perspective. She had coin, she just had to ration it. A mindset for the long term, rather than the immediate. Suffering now for comfort later. "I've been searching for my mother for several years now. Since I was nineteen, in fact. I'm twenty-three now. Before that, I did what I could to find any information about my magics. I'm sure you can imagine with my previous comments how well that went," she said, giving a soft grin at the notion. "As for the cost, well. I don't suspect it will be coin. Often, magi trade in lore, artifacts, or services. I do not know what Morrun will want. Speculation helps me little. The best I can do is step forward, be open and honest, and see where that path will take me. Of course...The years traveling have made me better able to know when that approach is best substituted for a more...Evasive one. But I guess you'll just have to trust me when I tell you I have a pretty infallible eye for when someone has less than pure intentions. I knew from the moment I saw you that I could trust you, after all, even before you challenged the pirates. And I could tell you didn't exactly trust me right away." She kept a smile about her as she spoke so plainly about this. "I don't blame you, of course. I'm a strange woman with strange magic, and these roads can be dangerous to everyone, even someone as stalwart as yourself."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt surprise, and a little bit of shame at how quickly she'd jumped to assumptions about Star. Apparently, she'd thought this out more than she'd thought originally. Nodding along to the explanation Star gave, and the apparent soft heart she had, Ellesandra felt herself thankful that she'd happened upon the bandits ambush in time. Someone like Star seemed to be the type of person this world needed more of, and it would have been quite a shame if those men had decided to kill her. "I apologize, Miss Lumina, for my assumption then. You seem to have prepared and planned for this more than I initially expected." She listened as Star explained how she had a good eye for someone's intentions, and that she could tell Ellesandra had not trusted her. She still didn't trust Star, not entirely anyways. She trusted Star not to randomly attack her, or maybe not to try to steal her purse, but she didn't really trust the mage yet. It would take more than a single conversation on an hour's long walk to get to that. "I mean no offense to you, of course Miss Lumina, for my lack of trust. It's entirely focused on experience, not that you seem untrustworthy." A nod was given to the idea of the strange magic. "And not understanding your magic doesn't help with that. But then again, magic isn't the best way to take me out, considering my own abilities around it." She was vague on purpose, not wanting to make it so that Star would understand enough to be able to work around such abilities.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I did say I don't blame you, didn't I?" she said, smiling at Ellesandra. She clearly took no offense. "You wouldn't be the first person to assume me some naiive, innocent woman. And while I do indeed hold good intentions for any who share those towards me, I am also aware that it has the duality of both...Inviting evil-doers to take advantage, as well as...Lulling those same evil-doers into consistently underestimating me. I do...Very much detest having to use my powers for harm. But I must, at times, as a last resort. Being outnumbered, however is...Still a major disadvantage." She gave another smile. Would she have come out of that okay? Maybe. But the likely scenario was that she took far more grievous wounds in the process. Her minimal injury remained possible thanks to the knight at her side. She took note of how Ellesandra was...Not a prime target for magic, and took note of this in the back of her mind, but did not press the issue. The two had arrived at the city outskirts at this point. The port city was busy, but not overly bustling. Guards at the gate stood in towers with crossbows; a stone perimeter wall surrounded the whole of the city. Things looked to be business as usual. Once inside the gates, the port to the east was the primary attraction, but the north and western faces of the city had plenty of businesses. A tavern, an inn, a smith, a breadmaker, several clothiers that sported sail-related signage that were doubtlessly adept at mending torn ship sails, among several other more niche businesses. But as the two moved through the city, one thing would be clear: The red and white striped shirts of the pirates featured on many others within the city. No ship in the port was flying the Jolly Roger flag, but...These pirates had gotten into the city, and were pervasive through it. They appeared to be keeping lawful, though some less than subtle cat-calls were made at Ellesandra and Star from the periphery. Star chose to ignore them and step onwards, aiming to head towards The Salty Salmon tavern, which appeared to be quite the main attraction at the center of the city. But if the knight saw fit to cause a scene, Star would stick by their side through it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra knew Star had said she didn't blame her, but that didn't mean she shouldn't be polite and apologize for such an expectation. She continued walking while listening to Star's explanation, feeling their gut tighten at the thought. "If only everyone had expectations of said duality." The words were mumbled to herself, not necessarily intended for Star to hear. The guilt intensified, fully wrapping around a core of sorrow that settled deep in her gut. She took a deep breath, and the emotions bundled up and were pushed down, being well and truly ignored once again. She'd gotten quite good at that. As they made their way into the city, Ellesandra became more on guard. They made sure to walk a bit closer to Star, ensuring any onlookers knew they were together and not just walking side by side, and that Star was under Ellesandra's protection. She had to resist the temptation to reach out and touch the small of Star's back, a habit in a similar situation in her past. It was interesting how people who looked similar to the pirates, and how multiple of them seemed to be roaming the city. This realization made Ellesandra walk with her right hand resting on the top of the rapier hilt, though she continued walking forward as if there weren't a problem at all. If there was anything she was good at, it was being on guard without looking like she was paranoid or activley watching everything. "You know the way to this contact of yours, Miss Lumina?" She asked, looking straight forward while keeping an eye on both of their purses as they entered the city with more people here and there. Cat calls were entirely ignored; it would only bring attention to them if they did anything about it prior to the callers getting more aggressive.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I was told to meet them here," she said, gesturing to The Salty Salmon tavern that was soon before them. The bustle of the core of the city could be heard from here, mostly as a dull roar in the background. Closer to the ports sat an open-air market that held most of the congestion of the city. Things of all nature being traded, possibly even less legal things in the darker corners. If the two should have to travel through that space, coin-purses would need near constant supervision, surely. Ignoring that, Star had kept an eye on Ellesandra as much as they kept an eye on everyone else. Star did have a habit of staring, it seemed. Whatever she might be looking at would remain a mystery for the time being, but she certainly seemed to be looking for, or at...Something. That attention stopped when they reached the tavern and pushed inside. The interior was decently busy. Not too many free tables, and the happy jaunt of a bard strumming a lute somewhere on the left side of the interior could be heard. A sea shanty, it seemed, as the lyrics waxed on about woes of a life at sea, hungry bellies and wet clothes in chasing a golden payday. Star took a rather direct route through the tavern to the right and towards the back. Seemed she had been given a precise meeting place. She joined a lone elven man at his table that had room for four. The man eyed Ellesandra, however, with a look that suggested they were an unexpected addition to the meeting. "Morrun?" asked Star. The elven man nodded. In the dull light of the tavern, Morrun's darker, moonlight-toned complexion made the shadows cling tightly to him. He was quite tall, clearly, but quite thin as well. Spectacles made his dull brown eyes larger than they were while looking at him. His brown hair was in a tight ponytail, though his hair wasn't terribly long. "Star, I take it?" asked the man in return. Star nodded. "And this is Ellesandra. She has graciously been my escort to the city," she said, notably keeping the introduction in line with their agreement. To the city, and nothing more. Morrun gave a small hum of acknowledgement. "Right. Well. I heard you were looking for magic that could help you divine a location, and then presumably get there," asked the elven man, his expression rather neutral as the two discussed business. He didn't give away much of anything in the way of what he might be thinking or feeling beyond the initial surprise of Ellesandra's presence, but he quickly accepted that as well. Star nodded to the man's summation. "That's about right. I was told you had information on the matter," Star replied. Morrun nodded. "Aye. I've got a lead for you. Not directly the magic you're looking for, but...A nugget. A trail you can follow that will get you closer to it," he said, then drew in a swift sniff. He eased back in his chair, crossing his arms. His arms, like the rest of him, were thin. The frame of a scholar, not a fighter. He had a pack by his feet which presumably contained some of his materials; the wooden ends of a scroll were visible poking out of the top if one leaned to look under the table to spy it. "...But I've got two conditions." He struck a stern expression as he said this. Preparing for pushback on the notion, perhaps, and ready to meet it firmly. Star didn't respond immediately, instead...Eyeing the man in a way that was vaguely similar to the way she studied Ellesandra along the way to the city. Just looking at him, as if she saw something. Whatever the case, it gave a pause in the conversation, if Ellesandra had anything to add.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt relieved when they reached their destination. Being inside a tavern might not be entirely safe either, but at the very least she wouldn't have to keep an eye on all the crowd. Normally this wasn't as bit of an issue, but with the pirates and the encounter Star had previously had with them already Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable with any of them. She did notice Star watching her, but didn't think anything of it, assuming this was simply Star being cautious about her as well, or finding something interesting. Perhaps her armor, or her demeanor or something? There were even some people who were interested in the color of her hair at a young age, though based on Star's own hair that was unlikely. She nodded, and let Star lead them into the tavern with a glance at the sign and name hanging before them. Salty Salmon seemed like a perfect name for a tavern in a port city, playing up to the fisherman or pirate customers. She followed Star in and did a quick sweep of the room, eyes scanning different doors and potential exits other than the front door just in case anything went down that required a quick escape. The fact they walked to the back corner of the room made Ellesandra uncomfortable, as it was likely going to put their backs to the rest of the room. She made no attempt to hide her perusal of the man sitting, also eyeing her. A quick assessment of any weapons that were obvious on his form, and then only giving him a brief nod when Star introduced her. As the two began to discuss business, Ellesandra stepped around the table, to the side. This put her a bit further from Star, but it allowed her the ability to keep an eye both on the room and on this man, Morrun, without having to constantly turn her head or look behind her. It also placed her back to one of the walls, which was ideal. Her arms crossed, listening into the conversation while taking up a practiced bodyguard's unseeing stare past Star. An illusion of privacy, as if Ellesandra wasn't there listening even if she was. Her lips were pressed into a thin line at the conditions comment, though no response given. This was Star's business to deal with.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pause in conversation lasted a few moments, Star and the elven man eyeing one another closely. Star eventually nodded. "Very well, what are they?" she asked, her voice more or less unchanged. She had mentioned expecting this, so it was likely little surprise how calmly she received it. Morrun gave a terse nod, then laid out his conditions: "First, five thousand gold pieces. Upfront. Non-negotiable," he said, his voice firm. Considering that a skilled bodyguard like Ellesandra could expect between one and at most five gold pieces per day for their services as a very well accomplished knight, and that a night's stay at the local inn was only eight silver - with ten silver to one gold - a price of five thousand gold was laughable. Absurd. A small fortune, and for what? Vague information? Despite the absurdity, Star said nothing, allowing the man to continue. "...And the other is that if your exploration of my valuable information bears fruit, I require a full report of your findings for my own study." By contrast, a far more reasonable request, though still arguably pompous on the man's part. Star gave another pause. She then tilted her head slightly. "What do you need the gold for?" she inquired simply. The man's brows knit and he leaned forward on the table, supported on his elbows. "The information I have is worth as much! It's none of your business what I use it for," he scoffed back, indignant. Star remained calm and composed in the face of this. She then lowered her voice to a volume that would make it so only the man and Ellesandra would be able to overhear: "...Why are you lying?" she asked, causing the man to grit his teeth and leer at Star. "Wh...What are you talking about? I've said no word of a lie!" he insisted, his tone hushing to match hers. His eyes then began to dart around, looking at some of the other patrons in the bar. Those patrons in question didn't seem to take notice of the discussion, though with Ellesandra's watch, it would be easy to pick up on some...Wandering eyes. Certain folk in the tavern were carrying on about their business with their tablemates, but also occasionally did look over at the table with Star and Morrun. Not directly spying, but...Seemed their meeting had some interest to certain folk present, who were trying - and failing - to be subtle about it. At least failing under the scrutiny of the experienced knight, that is. Nobody was standing up. Nobody was encroaching. But people were watching. Possibly listening. But there'd be no listening in on the current hushed voices. "You are lying," said Star, still hushed. "You grew nervous talking about the condition of gold. You were calm talking about the second condition, however. And when I asked you what the gold was for, you had a very large rise in anxiety. And now as I'm explaining to you how I know you're lying, your anxieties are getting stronger. You're...Scared about something. Guilty, as well," she went on to explain, her voice still kind as ever, even as she dissected the man's heart like it was laying on the table. If Ellesandra had been observing the man, they would not have been able to notice any clear tells about anything Star was saying. Perhaps Star was just bluffing? Morrun looked visibly shaken by this, however. "W-What are you doing? Reading my mind or something?!" he asked, keeping his voice low despite his clear anxiety. Star smiled and shook her head. "No. But that does say rather plainly that I am right, doesn't it?" she replied, still smiling. "If you'd just be honest, then perhaps I can help you. Because I certainly don't have five thousand gold to my name." Another pause in the conversation appeared, as the man was sent reeling and deliberating. His nervous demeanor, however, had earned the scrutiny of a pirate-looking fellow at another table. A suspicious eye trained on Morrun, suggesting some manner of...Investment in the elven man's dealings.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Was Star able to read people? not minds, Ellesandra didn't expect that was possible if she'd gotten into the position she'd been in before. She could have used that against the pirates if so, or maybe not even have gotten caught. But some people were just empaths, able to easily read someone's body language and tell how they were feeling. Was that why Star had kept looking at her during their walk? Could she tell that Ellesandra was working through her guilt at the memories Star brought up? Her jaw clenched at the thought, glancing towards Morrun for a moment to ensure that he didn't respond poorly at being called out, then back out into the tavern room. The pirate looking fellow keeping a suspicious eye on Morrun had her guard up, and though she obviously looked at him once when she first noticed him, she didn't keep an eye directly on him. Doing so would only alert him that she'd caught him staring with too much interest. Instead, she began looking at other tables, both to keep him in peripheral vision and also to see if there were any others that were looking towards the pirate man, or also looking towards their table. She did lean down briefly to whisper to Star, completely ignoring Morrun. "Heads up, Miss Lumina, your contact here has the active interest of at least one pirate in the tavern." It was a validation of what Lumina was saying, as well as encouraging Morrun to put his cards on the table. He couldn't exactly deny it at this point, not with how well Star had read him and that Ellesandra had called out he was being actively watched. Whether or not he actually did so would be up to him, but most would understand that sharing that information would be beneficial to getting any actual business done.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A brief time passed as Morrun weighed his options. Star leaned into the whisper that Morrun was certainly intended to hear as well, and nodded. She looked at him, once more studying him. Eventually, his conviction broke, and he sighed. "...Look," he began, quiet as he could be while still being audible. "The pirates. They took my wife. They tried to extort me, and when I said I didn't have the gold, they took her as...Collateral," he said, nearly spitting the final word. "They want five thousand gold as ransom, or who knows what they'll do. Who knows what they've already done," he said, moving his left hand up to push through his hair. A golden wedding band with green etching depicting an elvish phrase was on his ring finger. Not immediately obvious in the dim light, but visible if one was looking for it. Star's expression softened dramatically, not that it was ever particularly hard in the first place. Star moved to touch the thin lines of dried blood that were on her cheek, briefly closing her eyes as she did. "Mmn. I'm no stranger to their barbarity. I'm very sorry to hear that has happened to you, Morrun. I will get her free again for you and get her out of the city. So you'll do well to find a way to slip out without attracting attention." Just like that, Star was jumping head-first into what was obviously a dangerous situation. Not counting the deck-hands on the ship itself, the city had plenty more of a pirate presence. Enough to suggest theirs was one of the larger vessels in port. Did Star have a plan? It would be hard to assume she did, given the whole two minutes she had to come up with one. But she'd already proven in the past to be a thoughtful woman...So it would be difficult to know. Naturally, this had Morrun...More than a little skeptical. "Wh- You can't be serious," he said with a chuckle. A chuckle that was asking to be laughed along with. "This is...This is a joke, right?" he continued, looking at Star, then Ellesandra. "L-Look, I obviously want her back, more than anything. But, like...Are ye' blind, woman? Have you not seen how many of them there are? And no offence to either of you, but they've each got as much muscle in their arms as you do in your whole body. And much as your uh, escort there, looks plenty mean...I think you'll be needing about five of her at least to hold your own." Through all of Morrun's doubts, Star never buckled. She maintained an air of serenity and calm about her, as if the danger before her was trivial. It wasn't. She already showed how just three pirates were a danger for her. Was Star truly insane? So determined to do the right thing that she'd carelessly lay down her life just to try? One look at her said very clearly that she wasn't scared, if nothing else..

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced quickly back at Morrun when he mentioned they had taken his wife. A frown creased her face, but that was the only emotion that she displayed for people to see. Displeasure on her face, which could easily have been taken for him making an unreasonable demand. Her eyes narrowed at him for a moment, then looked back out onto the room to keep up guard. It would not, however, be hard for Star to see the anger that burned bright in Ellesandra. There was a desire, briefly, to walk over to the pirate who was keeping an eye on Morrun and just slam his head into the table. She would never do this, of course. She was too well trained and restrained to start something like this, but the desire to do so was there. She hadn't considered how she was going to respond to the situation when Star apparently volunteered to help save the woman. Ellesandra looked back at Star with alarm. "Miss Lumina" She said in protest, placing a hand on the table and partially leaning over it to mask her mouth movements as she spoke. "While I can empathize with wishing to help rescue this man's wife, that is a very dangerous activity to take on." For once, she actually agreed with this Morrun fellow; this had to be a joke. Ellesandra could take on a handful of pirates without magic surely, but a whole ship of them, potentially more? "If they are trained like the ones in the woods I can take on four or five together without magic I think, but a whole ship is pushing it even with magic, Miss Lumina." Nowhere in this had Star volunteered Ellesandra to help with this, but there was an unspoken expectation that Ellesandra was not letting Star do that alone.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had looked at Ellesandra briefly when the flash of anger rose up within them. Something that might be a little too coincidental. But it was brief and subtle enough to be overshadowed by other things. The tag-team of the elven man and the knight trying to talk her out of this had Star smiling even wider. To the point of giggling under her breath. Her bright, positive outlook was immune in that moment. "Well, there you both go assuming I had planned to fight. I did tell you I'm not so much a fan of doing that, didn't I, Miss. Rhinelander?" she said, mysterious as she was chipper about it all. "I know you're just as angry inside about this situation as I am," she continued, speaking to Ellesandra. "So you can rest just as easy as Morrun here. I'll take care of it. You've already saved me from danger once, so I'll do my absolute utmost to ensure it needn't be twice in one day, all right?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't notice the coincidental glance in time with their anger, but they did notice how Star seemed to call her anger out. Her eyebrows knitted in confusion for a moment, wondering if her anger had really been that noticeable on her face. She was usually better at keeping her anger in check on jobs, since it was a pretty important thing to make your client happy with you and if you were expressing anger at them they would feel uncomfortable. Taking a deep breath to work the anger down and mentally scold themselves for being so readable, they looked over to Morrun, then back out into the tavern. "Well, what exactly is your plan then, Miss Lumina? We've had but a few minutes of learning this, don't know what ship they're on or if she's even on the ship." Maybe Ellesandra was jumping to conclusions right now. Perhaps Star only really planned to do some information gathering, not actually go on a rescue mission. That would make more sense. Still, Star was giggling - did she not understand the danger she'd be in if the pirates caught her, based on how many they seem to have seen in town? Sure if so many were in town there might be a chance fewer were on the ship, but they had no idea what numbers they might be looking at.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star took note of the breath. The internal revision. The self-scolding. While Star couldn't know what precisely was going on in the woman's head, she knew enough about emotional patterns to take a solid guess. So it was, Star was left with a knowing, sympathetic smile on her lips. She didn't say a word about it, but looking at her, she certainly seemed to know...Something. But how could she? Had Ellesandra been so plain? Morrun similarly had been quite stalwart in hiding any emotion, and yet Star sniffed it out with only a few moments of that...Curious, studious gaze. How strange, indeed. With all said, Star looked at Morrun. "Can you point out which ship is theirs?" she asked. Morrun hastily nodded. "They've a few in port, but the primary galleon of their fleet is where she's being held," he said, keeping a hush about him to prevent unwanted listeners. "I saw them take her aboard. Couldn't tell you where inside, but...The captain's probably on the ship, too, an' he's a mean fucker. Are you...Sure you know what you're doing? He's not really one to be persuaded by anything but gold," Morrun went on to say. Star gently shook her head. "I wouldn't try to reason with them. Or rather...I already did try to do that, and it didn't work out so well," she said, offering a nervous giggle as she once more called reference back to Ellesandra's intervention. "So? What are you going to do?" he asked, looking at Ellesandra briefly as he echoed their request to know what Star was planning. Star took a moment to collect her thoughts, then nodded to herself. "I'm going to board the ship, find your wife, and take her to the outskirts of the city. The only part I still need to figure out is...How to get you, Morrun, out of the city without raising suspicion. All the pirates in the tavern here are on edge, likely expecting a big payday. They're undoubtedly going to have questions about how our meeting went. So we'll need to have something convincing that keeps them from thinking something is amiss. It might help if we make a louder announcement of agreement, to make it seem like I'm going to abide by the initial terms of payment." While it seemed Star had put a good deal of thought into this, the arguably most important part - the rescue - was something she seemed quite content to just leave at her just...Walking aboard and taking a prisoner away, as if she expected the pirates to be perfectly content with this plan of hers. Once more, Morrun was looking with exceptional uncertainty at Ellesandra, as if seeking confirmation from the knight as to whether Star was sane or not.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was similarly disappointed with Star's current plan of just walking on board this pirate ship and getting the prisoner. She crossed her arms, her face all but in a permanent frown during this conversation. Ellesandra was also concerned about this supposed captain on board. It took every ounce of her willpower not to ask Star if she had lost her mind, but she had to assume the woman had some sort of plan, right? She didn't seem to be suicidal, considering her mission and determination to find her mother. A glance was given to Morrun, all but meeting his eye and agreeing with him in regards to Star being crazy. Ellesandra considered whether or not she should just walk away. A glance towards the door was given and the thought crossed her mind, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Not only would that likely be condemning the man's wife, but even Star for whatever foolish plan she was going with. "I strongly disagree with this course of action, Miss Lumina. It isn't worth this." Her voice was loud enough to be heard this time. Her words were true, but she also knew that saying such out loud would make the listening in pirates think that Star was planning to actually pay the 5000 gold to Morrun, not that Star was planning to rescue his wife.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
And without missing a beat, Star was right alongside Ellesandra's lead, speaking aloud. "You might disagree with the price of a life, Miss. Rhinelander. But it's obvious. They have all the power, all the control. We'll have to find a way to gather up the money and pay the ransom," she said, smiling a knowing smile at Ellesandra. She then spoke quietly. Quietly enough for just Ellesandra to hear: "Please...Trust me. I won't be dying today," she said, then drew in a slow breath. "Hopefully, nobody else has to die today. I know I have already asked much of you, but...You're much more likely able to defend Morrun if it comes to that. Would I...Be able to rely on you to escort him beyond the city limits, into the northern forests?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well, Ellesandra wouldn't have gone so far as to talk about the ransom out loud. Maybe just agreeing to the terms about paying the 5,000 for this service. Still, Ellesandra didn't SHOW the surprise on her face, even if she felt it. And a little bit of irritation and worry directed at Star for being so upfront about it. The pirates might not be happy that Morrun had spoken to them of the ransom, rather than just requesting the money from them. A glance was given his way, then back to Star. "I will not let you go face whatever you are doing alone. Not without hearing your plan." And honestly, not likely with that. She wasn't going to let a charge walk into a trap or a dangerous situation, and lose her. Not again. The guilt and sorrow started to bubble up, but it was pushed down again. She couldn't let past mistakes effect her focus now, but she also couldn't help but learn from them. She wouldn't let Star go be reckless on her own.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The word 'ransom' did very much perk up the attention of a few pirates. But where any civil city would hear a crime in the midst and call to the guards...It only seemed to embolden the pirates in the Salty Salmon. Chuckles resounded from a few of them. Beer steins clinked together. Hearing 'all the power, all the control' had the pirates donning wide smirks, and even managed to identify a few patrons who broke into grins over the words who were not wearing the same colours. Sympathizers? Undercover agents? It was hard to say. But one thing was certain: The bartender was horrified. Scared for his life as he shakily wiped clean a beer stein. A few clues that one might be able to use to discern that threats and violence had beaten this city into submission. It was, once again, another of Star's appeal to emotion. An attempt to make the pirates feel more secure. The way they had appealed to Ellesandra in the forest, the cocky, arrogant way with which they described their obviously illegal actions, making a mockery of Ellesandra's integrity by exerting force of their presence over those who dared to stand up to them was likely far more effective against those not clad in Ellesandra's knightly attire. Star listened to Ellesandra's request, and it caused Star to don a briefly...Complicated expression. She was studying them again. A bit of wetness then appeared in Star's eyes. Too hard for any but Ellesandra to see given the dim light. But it was there. The start of tears. But Star blinked them away, steadying herself. "Not here," she said, keeping a whisper. "Announce that you have to take me some place to secure the money. Make up something believable, and lucrative. Just something that can buy us time to get somewhere private. I can explain everything there where other ears aren't listening."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She took a deep breath, pushing down again on the irritation and concern. She shouldn't be letting those be so visible, even though to anyone but Star they didn't seem to be. Still, Star could seemingly read her face well enough to recognize that Ellesandra was getting more emotional about this than she should. At least, based on the expression Star had given her, Ellesandra assumed that. "Fine." The word came out harshly, as if she were angry at a young child being petulant. That emotion was actually behind it, but Ellesandra wasn't a half-bad actor. "If you insist on throwing your money away for this project, lets at least go and secure the coin so we can ensure it gets into the right hands and isn't pickpocketed on the street. It may not be MY gold, but I'll be damned if I let some two-bit pickpocket make off with it instead of securing our transaction. I know you don't like blood, so I'll warn you now any scoundrel who tries will have my sword through their palm and pinning it to their eye." Okay, that was grotesque, and Ellesandra would not do that. She was not quite so gruesome or ruthless, but pirates respected such threats, didn't they? While Ellesandra was okay with killing someone if she deemed it necessary in a situation, she would never go out of her way to make a scene of it or make it any more painful than it had to be. Well - with one scenario's exception, but she was NOT thinking about that. Stepping back, she looked through the tavern and motioned for Star to get up and lead the way out, keeping up her angry persona with a set jaw and furious eyes that dared anyone in the tavern to reach for either of them.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star lightly winced at the harsh, admonishing words. Her intent was never to upset Ellesandra, and seeing that she did so had clearly affected her. Ellesandra might hide all their pain and emotion as well as they could, but Star continued to do anything but, and took the insight of a five-year-old to determine what she was feeling in most moments. Was she capable of hiding her emotion? Perhaps. She had showed some subtlety when under duress when Ellesandra first happened upon her. And she clearly knew how to tie together a ruse. Was Ellesandra right to hold sincere doubts about Star? To hold back trust? She was hardly a simple woman to figure out. "Keep comfy here, Morrun. We'll come back to find you," she said to the elf. As she stood to join Ellesandra, the effects of the knight's words was clear on the tavern. Pirates specifically avoided making eye contact, chuckling to themselves as the threat hunger over the room. "Oooh, tough girl and her princess, eh?" came one muttering as the two passed by. "Ey, should let cap'n know to double the price. Girlie's got such nice clothes, she obviously can afford it," said another to his comrades. Laughs and chuckling was had at the expense of the two. Star ignored it all, as she presumed Ellesandra would, too. She kept an eye on them, however. Just watching them. Studying them, as she continued to be. Nobody dared reach for or try to stop the two, content to hide behind petty comments. If the two broke away, a some ten minute walk would see them able to reach the north edge of the city, and another five to rise up a lazy hill path to a forested edge, making it look for any onlookers that the two were well and truly departing to some other place to secure the coin. If all went well, she sought out a secure space concealed by the trees, an offshoot from the main path that led to a small pond that gave good concealment among the trees, then turned to Ellesandra to hear their concerns and answer their questions. Of course, if the knight's emotions got the better of them before then and a fight broke out, then Star would have some improvising to do.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had been acting in her anger for the most part, at least for the last bit there. She had been irritated at, and concerned for Star for putting herself in this situation, and there was anxiety in regards to whether this would turn out similarly to past situations like this. However, that anger ignited for real as soon as she'd begun to follow Star out and someone commented on them being a Knight and her Princess. It took every ounce of Ellesandra's willpower not to lash out. The anger and pain that comment had brought up wasn't something most people would be able to tell, of course. It flared in them, the ball of pain fueling the anger at such a comment, at how it cut much, much deeper than Ellesandra would ever admit out loud. Her left hand moved to rest on the rapier upon her right hip, casually threatening to draw it if needed, and squeezing tightly to the hilt in an attempt to keep it busy from just striking one of them on their way to the door. Getting out of the tavern was a breath of fresh air, even if they were still surrounded by potential enemies. Ellesandra didn't let her guard down even as they crested the hill, glancing down below them for a good view of if they had been followed at all. She scanned the area for a moment, taking that time to collect herself and bottle emotions tighter. Star was too similar to Ellesandra's past; as soon as this job was done she needed to move on or this would just keep coming up. Turning, she nodded to Star to begin her explanation.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Indeed, they had not been followed. Star hat noticed very swiftly the correlation between the comment and Ellesandra's anger. She saw it flare up around them like an inferno engulfing them. She held trust in them to keep it under wraps, but the final moments walking out of the tavern were...Tense. It showed on Star once they were in the clear. She was visibly concerned as she looked at Ellesandra. But, an explanation had to come first. She drew in a slow, steadying breath. She then closed her eyes. She extended an arm. A blue aura possessed her arm, slowly shifting around it with wispy lines of mana. Then, she slowly closed her hand into a fist. The aura, once a soft, sky blue, became a shimmering beacon of scintillating colours. A rainbow, kaleidoscopically shimmering with a trillion different colours. It covered from her fingertips to her shoulder. She was clearly concentrating on this. Her eyes opened, looking at Ellesandra. "...Strike my arm, Miss. Rhinelander. Hard as you can." She paused, smiling. "...Trust me."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
On the way, Ellesandra was too distracted with her emotions and keeping an eye out for any trouble to notice how Star was looking at her. On top of that, she had used the time spent getting to their location to help filter out her anger. It was still there when they stopped, but deep conscientious breathing had helped to reduce the intensity of it. When Star began summoning some sort of blue light, then a rainbow around her arm brought curiosity to the front. Was Star displaying some form of her ability to Ellesandra, as explanation for the plan? However, when she was asked to strike Star as hard as she can, she snorted. She didn't respond verbally, but she also had no plan to actually strike Star as hard as she could. She'd known this mage for what, three hours at this point, maybe less? She didn't trust Star yet; trust was not something Ellesandra gave easily. Reaching out, Ellesandra did strike Star's arm with an open palm, about as hard as a sibling might punch one another in a friendly jesting way. Not intended to really damage, but if whatever she was doing didn't block any of the impact it would be sore. That would be enough for her to identify what exactly was happening and how sturdy Star's magic might be. She did have to make an active effort not to draw Star's magic into herself when making contact with it, however. If this was supposed to be a test to how Star would hold up against the pirates, it would not do to use her own unique abilities on it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star remained still as Ellesandra struck her arm. Or rather, attempted to. Ellesandra instead struck something that felt solid as adamantine. Star's arm did not move in the slightest. If either of them would be sore, it would be the knight, but as much was unlikely given their less than enthusiastic strike. Star just smiled. "If that's as hard as you can hit, I will have to wonder who it was aided me against the pirates a few short hours ago," she said with a giggle. "...Your blade, much less those of the pirates, cannot harm me if I have time, mana, and focus enough to employ this strength of my gift. I encourage you to truly strike my arm, so you can hold confidence in more than my words that I will be safe." She kept her smile. "...I do keep asking you to trust me, but...I understand that that doubts I see in you will remain. I hope only that I can prove in time that I have aimed to be trustworthy at every step. You did save me, after all. I'd not wish to return to that initial scenario in which you found to me to test fate and see if my magic would have guided me from harm. I owe you at least my honesty for that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shouldn't have been surprised. She'd made the attack expecting magic to have somehow strengthened Star's arm, but it being as completely solid as it felt still made her raise an eyebrow. "To be fair, Miss Lumina." She said, frowning at the comment about the pirates. "I hardly struck the pirates with any strength. Three quick stabs was all that was needed, none of which required strength behind them." It was true; between them having been blinded and her own haste spell, which in hindsight wasn't necessary but Ellesandra hadn't known how inexperienced the pirates were at first, it had been simple to get past their guard and simply shove a sharp blade into fleshy skin. When invited to truly strike Lumina's arm though, she had shaken her head in refusal. "If I were to not hold back, Miss Lumina, I would absorb the magic effecting your arm, and strike through it. Or enchant my rapier to strike through." Why was she saying this? Because it got her away from the topic of Star risking herself for this woman. Not that Ellesandra thought the woman's life wasn't worth risking for, but STAR being the one to risk it wasn't what she wanted. "So, what is your plan then? To coat yourself in magic and simply walk in there, take her, and walk out?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a difficult smile at Ellesandra's words. On one hand, knowing they hardly even had to try made her feel a bit better that they hadn't been in danger. On the other, it made her wish the pirates would have seen sense all the more. Either way, she undid the magic on her arm, letting it disperse, then moved to the pond to cup some water her in her hand that she used to wipe the blood of her face, finally, before turning to her companion again. "I somehow doubt that is true, but I won't tempt fate by trying it if that is how it is," she said, clearly confident in her own abilities, but also wise enough to not let her desire to reassure Ellesandra take things to an extreme that might see her hurt. Apparently Star was capable of assessing risk after all. "Well, a little more than that. That part is just to ensure they can't hurt me. But if everything does go to plan, then I won't have to worry about anyone taking a swing at me in the first place." She realized she would need to justify those statements more, something she couldn't do in the meeting. She drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. "My magic is something called Auramancy. There have been some other magics by similar or identical names I've found in my travels, which I'm sure you can understand is frustrating. But mine, specifically, is concerned with the manipulation of auras, insofar as that applies to the energies that surround and permeate all living things. It's...Very difficult to make it all make sense in words. But with a little subtlety on my side, the hope is to sneak onto the ship with some discretion and use my powers to influence anyone on board into passivity. It's not very easy to do that if someone is already hostile, but...I am confident I can take a subtle approach that can avoid suspicion long enough to get to where Morrun's wife is being held. I know an arcane spell called Knock that will allow me to get her out of her cell, and once I have her, another spell called Dimension Door will carry us from the ship to the edge of the forest in an instant. That's why I was hoping you could be here, to ensure the landing space was safe. To ensure that we could have an expeditious getaway if there was an alarm. To...Deal with any pirates who swiftly ascended to challenge Morrun." Again, she seemed to have difficulty talking about the notion of killing, necessary as it might be. "A frontal assault is suicide, I know. But I can maintain my chromatic aura long enough to keep me safe if things go south, long enough to get me to his wife and out. It...does mean I imagine that sleeping at the inn no longer being an option is a foregone conclusion. But I am fine to sleep among the trees if it means saving an innocent woman. And I will know where she is held simply because I will be able to...See her distress." Well, that certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense at face value, now would it?

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned deeply at the explanation being provided. Even should Star be able to influence others that way, it was dangerous. And on that topic, was Star influencing her? Was that why her emotions were so reactive around Star? No, no Star had no idea about how her appearance and mannerisms effected her. Or how the Princess and Knight comment had effected her. At least, not WHY it had effected her. Ellesandra crossed her arms, eyeing Star for a moment. "That would explain your apparent empathy, I guess." If she could sense someone's aura, she could probably tell if someone was lying, couldn't she? It would probably make it particularly easy for her to be insightful, too. No wonder she'd been able to read Morrun like a book. Was that why she had kept looking at Ellesandra before? With a short nod, Ellesandra took a deep breath and let out a sigh. "Okay, I'll go meet up with Morrun and tell him we are going to get his gold, but want him to come meet us rather than carrying it into the city. I'm sure we'll have one or two people follow but the pirates probably won't assume he's ditching his wife. If any follow I'll take care of them." She glanced around at the woods, planning out where would be a good place to wait in trap, but continued talking while she did so. "Now, what is the plan if for some reason you can't get out? They have an anti-magic field or something?" She had to ask. Things happened, and she really didn't want to have to storm a ship to save Star due to lack of planning.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a soft smile. "I have been described as an empath before, yes. It's not a simple as just being able to know intrinsically if someone is lying to me, or if someone is holding out, or...Well, anything really. An aura is a complex thing. It's taken me a lifetime to be able to make as much sense of it as I can. My mother was leagues beyond my current capabilities, and is undoubtedly ever more so...If she still lives." Another sad smile. "As for the pirate ship, well...I would be able to tell rather swiftly if it was made of sussar bark, or if anti-magic was being used." A nuance to her power that Ellesandra might not yet understand, she surmised, so chose this moment to explain. She did say she owed them her honestly, after all. "You see I...The typical medium for my magic is sight. I see auras. I see emotion. Sometimes, that emotion carries memories. Sometimes, flickers of emotion linger like clouds that I can follow. Intense moments of the heart make the auras of those who experience them spike, and can leave remnants. I looked upon all the ships in port when we entered. I could see the auras of all the individuals on each of the ships, and lingering clouds on those which were abandoned. I would be able to feel the void of anti-magic if it was upon the ship as I approached and give me time and warning to leave earlier than expected. I will say I...don't expect them to have such things, but I admire your forward thinking." Another smile. "It...Means a lot to me that you are willing to support me in this. I already am the one who owes you, and yet you selflessly offer your aide yet again. I...Do not know how I will begin to repay you, but...Should you think of anything, I pledge to do all I can for all you've done and continue to do for me. Thank you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She SAW emotions? Was that why she kept looking at Ellesandra oddly? She hadn't been sure why, chocking it up to gratefulness, curiosity, or maybe even attraction, but seeing her emotions? Ellesandra was a very guarded individual with her emotions, she shared them with no one. The fact that Star could just slip past that guard and see them disturbed her. Not only that, but she thought about the strength of the emotions she'd been feeling in the past couple of hours. How Star reminded her of her Princess, and how that had thrown all of her guarded emotions everywhere. Typically she'd go weeks without letting herself feel them, but it seemed every other conversation with Star they were coming up based on the similarities. Had Star seen the memories associated with those emotions? Distrust sprung up in her and her jaw clenched, physically taking a step back from Star and clenching her fists. Ellesandra looked coiled, ready to spring into a fight or to escape at a moment's notice. She took every emotion she could currently feel and bundled it up, locking it in a box firmly and securely. She reined in every ounce of control she had to repress everything she was feeling, at least everything related to her past. She didn't answer the thanks at all, seemingly turning entirely business-focused. Reaching back into her pack, she slung it forward enough to pull out a hair tie and began pulling her hair up into a warrior's ponytail - how she typically wore it if she expected any chance at combat. "I'll ensure Morrun gets here." Her words were clipped, edging on harsh. There was anger in her tone, but it was being tightly controlled. "Should anything go wrong and you can't get here, make some sort of sign in the sky. I'll look out for it."

Star Lumina
Star was an insightful enough woman to know that what she was admitting might provoke a poor reaction. She wanted to be open an honest, but she knew honesty came with its pitfalls. It was curious that what flicked the switch was her being able to see them, rather than sense them. That was the admission that saw Ellesandra retreat into themselves, at least; Star had long gone beyond finding such things coincidental in her travels. People could wear masks. People could fight their emotions. But even Ellesandra's attempts to embrace the utmost stoicism would prove futile. Emotions were wild and untamed. Uncontrollable at their core. One could resist them. One needn't be ruled by them. But they still clung to the aura. Focusing one's mind on a task had some effect, but Ellesandra's guilt was so overbearing that force of will could not repress it. Not that it changed anything. Star had been seeing it for hours now. She similarly could see the anger, the distrust. That it wounded Star was obvious. Her bright, open, honest self being rejected by this woman who saved her did hurt, and the way her eyes grew heavy and drift to the ground between them made it clear. Ellesandra might fight to keep themselves stoic, but...Star was as easy and plain to read as ever. She said nothing in response. She simply nodded twice to the order, then silently walked past Ellesandra and began back towards the city, leaving the knight to take care of Morrun.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the distance grow between them. Saw the disappointment in Star's eyes and how she'd looked down to the ground. The hurt at Ellesandra's distrust and anger was evident. Why the fuck did she feel guilty over that? She reminded herself that Star had invaded her privacy, it was like reading a mind. Sure maybe Star didn't exactly have an option; Ellesandra didn't know if she could turn the sight off. But it still felt like she'd been betrayed, somehow. That Star had seen past things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone; that her defenses had failed her. Hell, it her defenses were probably all but useless in front of Star's magic. She needed to finish this job - even if she wasn't getting paid, it was a job - and then get away from Star. It was dangerous having someone who could see her emotions like that, emotions Ellesandra hadn't let herself process and had no desire to talk about. There was a moment where Ellesandra watched Star walk off, eyes scanning either side of the road to ensure that there wasn't any danger down Star's path. She waited until she could no longer see Star, to ensure she'd made it that far safely at least, before heading back towards the town herself. She made for a direct path with the tavern again, her real anger being used to glare down anyone who so much as looked her way with interest. Passing those who had catcalled them before, she gave them an icy stare that all but challenged them to try something or say something again. She wanted an outlet for her anger, even if she knew that was stupid, unnecessary, and wouldn't help. She wasn't some reckless boy who got angry and stormed through the town making it everyone else's problem. She was a disciplined, well trained knight and bodyguard. It didn't mean that temptation wasn't there, though. When she made it to the tavern, she did a quick sweep of the patrons again, making note of those who had obviously been part of the pirate group before and where they were located, and then searching for Morrun. Hopefully he hadn't gotten himself in trouble while they'd walked out to make plans.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The two had not been gone long at all. That, in itself, had a few raised eyebrows. Some...Expectant ones. From the catcallers to the tavern-dwellers, they weren't quite smart enough to pick up that something was wrong, but they sure did find it a tiny bit odd. Odd enough to think on it for a few seconds, then return to their steins of ale. It was surely someone else's problem to sort out. Morrun, meanwhile, had collected his things and looked like there was a spring sitting under his seat. The company this tavern provided gave him no delights, and he was eager to be rid of them. Star, meanwhile, moved through the city towards the docks. No signs of distress or alarm could be heard on the air, so, so far everything was going to plan. Morrun looked at Ellesandra with hope, eagerly awaiting instruction.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced once more at the pirates around the tavern, to ensure they weren't about to get up and make any moves or anything foolish. Once she was confident that they were staying out of the way, at least for now, she looked back to Morrun, who seemed over excited. "Come. I'm not foolish enough to carry that type of money into what could have been an elaborate ploy to rob us. You'll meet us and provide the service we are paying exorbitant fees for, and then you can take that money back for this ransom." She dropped her voice, still loud enough for most in the tavern to hear but playing it off as if she were grumbling to herself and it wasn't intended for others to hear. "My Lady apparently has deeper pockets than she does sense." Ellesandra was trying to play up that she knew this was a stupid thing to pay for, and more money than appropriate. That would be suspicious to the pirates, certainly. But if she were playing it as if her employer was simply a bleeding heart rich noble who didn't care about the cost. It would potentially place a target on Star's back later, but if things went according to plan Star wouldn't be here long enough for that to matter. She stepped to the side and motioned Morrun towards the door, not letting him follow behind or anything. "I'll lead you up to where we're camped currently. You'll get to see the gold, but you are not to touch it until you've provided her the service. Understood?"


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Y-Yes, understood, understood!" said Morrun, eagerly jumping up. The pirates had a few laughs at his expense, which he scowled at, but rose above and moved forward to walk towards the entrance. One of the pirates then also stood. One wearing a long black coat. Scimitar was in its sheath, but the handle clearly visible. The man bore a scar over one green eye and had a red bandana over his hair, and was clean shaven unlike most of the others. "I think I'll join you," the man brazenly said. "See about where you're camped. Can't risk our ah...Legitimate business transaction going and walking away from us now can we?" Suspicion hadn't been breached yet, but this man, of seemingly higher rank, but discernibly not the captain of this crew, saw fit to throw his weight around a little. They had clearly operated with impunity thus far, and the brazen confidence that made the other pirates sloppy fighters similarly was making this man - presumably a first mate - feel bold enough to invite himself along for the walk. "Come on lads, two of ya get off your plump asses and take a walk, could use it to sober up a little and get back to work when we get back, eh? Captain's gonna want to haul ass outta 'ere once we have ourselves a little spending spree at the conclusion of this transaction." At his remarks, two of the other pirates rose off their stools, cursing under their breath and just slightly unsteady in their gait, to join the first mate. The first mate then motioned to the door for Ellesandra, wearing the most smug grin he possibly could.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked back towards the pirate, obviously someone of more influence than the base crew, and a frown creased her face. Her eyes narrowed and she looked the man up and down. "You expect me to let you come near my Lady, armed, while she has gold prepared for a transaction? Criminals of your level do not respect honor, so don't give me your word or anything." Her left hand moved over to rest on the hilt of her rapier on her hip. It was a subtle threat, but not one that she was actively making. "If you must come, you will wait back from the camp. You may be within eyesight, but I will not tolerate you approaching." Ellesandra was calling upon every bit of her knightly confidence and authority. She wasn't tall by any means; likely most of those in the tavern would stand much taller than her 5'1 height. However, she had the presence of someone much bigger than she actually was, a confidence of a trained soldier and one that would not be afraid to fight her way out of something. She was drawing what would be considered a normally appropriate boundary for the safety of her Lady, without outright refusing the Pirate. Hopefully, the pirate wouldn't let his confidence push past that.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirate placed his hands on his hips and smirked. "Or wha? You gonna prick me with your needle, pipsqueak? Oughta be a wench servin' up ale in 'ere rather than tryin' t' lay down the law," he said, then nudged his pirate mate with his elbow. "Ey, get a load o' 'iss lass, tryna' tell us how it is, eyy?" he said, sharing a chuckle with his mates as they collectively bathed in their misogyny they found so hilarious. "Pff, whatever you say, 'muh lady'," he said in as mocking a tone as he could. "We won't trample on your pretty posies, just make quick of it, yeah? Any funny business and I'm sure the captain won't have any qualms tripling the er, ah...Protection fee we're charging." His arms crossed over his chest here, sporting a smug stance as he towered over the shorter knight by an entire foot. He wasn't nice about it, but it seemed Ellesandra's demands were being heeded. A need to enforce his pride and power in front of his mates balanced by...Perhaps a desire to not upset the captain by screwing things up, and thus, the concession was given. "Lead on, proud knight, to your little fairy garden with all its shiny little coins, yeah?"


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra ignored the misogyny. All that mattered to her was that he'd agreed to it. The threat about tripling the protection fee was ignored, since they weren't actually going to be paying it anyways. Ellesandra considered encouraging him to go first, rather than turning her back to him and walking through. She didn't want to, but she didn't think he'd go along with that if she demanded it. "As you wish. Unfortunately, my Lady has gold, but not the necessary remove curse spells to fix whatever is going on with your face, if that's what you're hoping to find." With a smirk, she stood to the side as she opened the door, then closed it behind her as she stepped through. He might stop the door from closing, but by then she'd have stepped out, to the side and where she could keep an eye on him while walking forward. There was no attempt to stop him, or the others he'd brought with him, from following. Instead, she motioned for Morrun to continue forward and eyeing the pirates and, as long as they didn't start a fight, would begin leading them out towards the forest where she'd chatted with Star.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The man didn't find the joke funny. It was risky. Getting the jab in nearly had the man luging in response. One of his mates was stepping forward, only to have the first mate plant his hand on the lesser pirate's chest. "Easy lad. We get the money first, then we can show the lil' pipsqueak here what a cursed face looks like. See how inspiring she is in that armor with that ugly mug cut to ribbons, yeah?" he said, quietly to his mate, but loud enough to ensure Ellesandra heard him. Assuming that didn't set the knight off in turn, the men followed. When exiting, Ellesandra would be able to see Star - her dress didn't exactly make her subtle - as she was boarding the ship. Seemed she got past anyone on the docks without a hitch. Some pirates approached Star when she boarded. It was too far to hear anything or make out details, but whatever it was that was said seemed good enough for the deck hands who let her pass. She then disappeared to the bowels of the ship while one of the deck hands made their way to what could be presumed to be the captain's quarters. The first mate and his merry band of drunkards were right behind Ellesandra and Morrun, who at this point looked stressed enough to have a heart attack right in front of the knight. His pack was on his back, and he walked with rigidity to his gait. The group would be able to make it to wherever Ellesandra led them, however there would be some expectation of results once the group arrived from the three pirates.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond to the threat. She shouldn't have made the jab, in all honesty, but there was something about how he'd insulted Star that was still bothering her. When Ellesandra noticed Star getting aboard the pirate ship, she made sure not to watch the ship directly. No, she kept an eye out of her peripheral vision to ensure Star got on without difficulty, but otherwise pointed up towards where they were going to ensure the pirate's attention was on her and their destination, no straying eyes back to potentially see what Star was doing. "We've made camp just over the ridge up there, into the forest. That's our destination." She made her way, not looking at the pirates at all other than keeping them within sight to ensure they didn't try to backstab her or anything. When the crested the ridge and looked into the woods, Ellesandra touched Morrun's arm and motioned to a copse of trees. "We're camped just past those trees. Why don't you go speak with her and start whatever magical detection you're doing while I have a chat with our friends here?" She wanted to ensure morrun was at least a few steps away before any fighting began. She had also been sure to place herself between Morrun and the men when she said this. If they tried to reach for him, they'd have to reach past her first - which even if they thought she was a weak woman would be stupid to do. Her gaze cut to the pirates with a firm look. "As I said before, i don't trust them near my Lady."


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The pirates seemed more or less indifferent to the goings-on, eager only to get their payday, and not do anything that would mess it up. So, despite some mocking smirks from the first mate, he was content to stuff his hands in his pockets and whistle to himself, rising up to his tip toes and falling back down again. Morrun of course heeded Ellesandra's words and moved away into the forest. Obviously, not finding Star, he understood what was happening and made sure to stay out of sight somewhere nearby. He was ready to start chanting magical nonsense to fool the pirates if needed, but he hoped to simply remain out of sight. Then it was just...A waiting game. The pirates were passive, but expectant. They wouldn't wait forever. And they certainly would know something was up the moment Star showed up, since Star was apparently over with Morrun doing weird magic stuff while Ellesandra stood guard. Star was certainly hard at work...And no signal in the sky just yet. So it was Ellesandra's moment to either bide their time, or make a move.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had no intention of waiting for Star. She wanted these pirates dealt with both in case Star did signal that Ellesandra was needed, and before Star returned so that she wouldn't be in danger during the fight. Ellesandra waited, back to the brushes and facing the pirates passively for a few moments, giving Morrun plenty of time to head in and find somewhere to hide, away from danger. She gave herself to a silent count of thirty before she withdrew her rapier. "You have the option of returning to town now and keeping your lives, or fighting and dying. Your choice." She was sure her drawing her rapier had put them on edge, but she hadn't attacked; not at first. She held the rapier in front of her, right foot going back and sinking down into a proper fighting stance. She didn't use magic, based on how unskilled the previous pirates had been. The two drunk ones she wasn't worried about at all; the more authoritative one might possess some skill, but she wasn't dropping her guard. She could always add magic if needed later.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The moment Ellesandra reached for her rapier, the first mate drew his sword. He had clearly been just as ready for a fight, though that message didn't make it to his two lightly inebriated comrades. They had a few seconds before they joined in the fight as well. The two circled around either of Ellesandra's flanks, leaving them surrounded. A familiar fighting position. "...Way I sees it, there's three of us and one of you," began the first mate. "So I thank 'ye, for giving me the chance I was itchin' for to pay you back for all that holier-than-thou bullshit you carried in on your boots the moment you set foot in our turf," he said, venom dripping from his words. Not that it was any surprise, but they weren't going to pull punches now that they had been given reason to fight. And if Ellesandra hadn't already started the fight, the three of them rushed in all at once, coordinating their attack to all strike from different angles at, more or less, the same time, aiming to chop at any part of Ellesandra not covered by armor.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"I guess I'll do to you what I did to your friends out on the road, then." She had timed the comment specifically to potentially throw them off when they planned to attack, but whether or not it worked she didn't wait to see. As they all began to attack, she quickly pivoted towards one of the drunkards the movement itself dodged two blades, and her own moved up to knock the other away. She went for the same killing blow she'd had on the others, a slice into the throat and pull out. Ellesandras movements were fluid, not stopping whether or not she'd hit. She'd used the movement to create distance between herself and the others, ducking from where she'd been surrounded into where she could face them all, and quickly stepping into the other drunkard with an attempt to do the same to him. They were the easy targets, and she could use fancy footwork to avoid the only sober one of them until his two companions were taken care of. That was her plan, anyways.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The footwork of the knight was far and above the three pirates. The two lackeys had no chance. Their swings were filled with arrogance and confidence, even in the wake of the comment about Ellesandra felling two others. The first ate Ellesandra's rapier in the neck, paralyzed by the attack as he was left to bleed out once the rapier was withdrawn. The distance was too short, however, for the action to keep Ellesandra out of harm's way. The other lackey's sword went wide, but the first mate had clearly seen his share of sorties. Enough that the strike to his underling presented him an opportunity to swing horizontal across Ellesandra's thighs. The metal bit into flesh. Shallow wounds, not enough to impede Ellesandra, but torn fabric and the first droplets of crimson from the knight at the hands of these criminals was spilled. His follow up was to backhand his own other, living lackey, which saved the man's neck from the thrust of the rapier by inches as he reeled back just before Ellesandra could thrust. He might be a criminal, but he clearly had some sense, even if it came with callousness towards his men. He didn't seem fazed that the other died. With the initial engagement sorted, Ellesandra then found the remaining two pirates staring her down. Hesitation, and fear rose in the first mate, as if surprised the knight was...Exactly who they claimed to be. But rather than charge in head on again, the first mate produced a glass bottle of some sort filled with crackling energy and swiftly hurled it at Ellesandra's feet. The bottle shattered on impact, exploding into a cloud of thick smoke that obscured the battlefield. The smoke stung at Ellesandra's eyes and throat, but a knight like her would find the crude trick was not up to the staunch fortitude she possessed. Some coughing and watering eyes aside, it wouldn't be able to daze her as the pirates expected it might; however, it did still obscure vision, and thus needed reliance on sound. The charges were staggered; the lackey first, with the first mate a few steps behind. Given his previous attack, it seemed he might be counting on Ellesandra to attack the first available target, then use the chance to run them through, which is precisely what they would attempt to do if Ellesandra played their game. Of course, the obscuring smoke went both ways. So there was no guarantee Ellesandra was even where they expected her to be in the seconds between the smoke engulfing the battlefield and the charge starting.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had let out a silent curse at feeling the blade slice at her thighs. Perhaps she should have gone ahead and used magic to ensure easy victory. Still, they didn't really enjoy the idea of the lethargy that hit them after using their haste spell, and their other magic was more focused against magic users. Ellesandra was frowning as she faced the remaining two pirates, a little impressed with the first mate slapping his companion out of the way of her strike. Well, that just meant she wouldn't be able to go for the quick, easy death for them then. As the man slammed the bottle onto the ground and smoke pillowed out, Ellesandra quickly backpeddled. No use standing in smoke that was stinging at her eyes and throat, though she did her best to remain silent while doing so and to take careful steps back so she didn't fall backwards. As such, she was not where they believed her to be when attacking. In fact, she had begun circling around, looking for movement as she did so, making her way around where the smoke was billowing. It would start spreading out soon, allowing visibility again, but when it did Ellesandra was standing on the other side of where she had been before. Her free hand was up, partially covering her mouth and nose to filter any of the smoke a little more, and as soon as she could see one of them well enough to strike, she did. The goal was to strike before they got their whereabouts back, whichever one she struck, and this time she was aiming straight at the person's chest.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a calm that fell over the battlefield as Ellesandra retreated and circled the smoke plume. Their attempts to be stealthy were hampered by the heavy armor they wore; the clacking of the metal even when moving slowly made enough noise against the dead quiet of the forest to keep a vague location in mind. From within the smoke, there was nothing at first. Then... "Wh-- Hey! What are you doing ya maddie-- WHOAAAA!" From within the smoke cloud, the lower ranking pirate sailed through the air at Ellesandra, having been thrown at her with quite an impressive toss that had the lackey sailing like a cannonball at the knight. As unconventional as strategies came, and an absolute epitome of pirate tactics. No honour among thieves, and no care for each other's lives either it seemed. But the opening provided was slim, so whether Ellesandra took the bait and killed the man in flight, only to be braced or toppled by the impact, or rolled out of the way, the first mate was right behind, ready to stab clear through his ally to get at the knight, or take advantage of her lowered guard to thrust at whatever space he could see that wasn't armored.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't forgotten the noise she made, but when there was movement and confusion in the smoke, she had been hoping the noise wasn't easy to follow. Still, she had NOT expected one of the pirates to be THROWN at her. She did not take the easy stab it provided, instead dodging to the side, which allowed her to see the first mate coming in behind his companion who had been thrown at her. She stepped up towards him while his companion sailed past to her right, feinting a stab towards his neck like he would expect her to take. She kept her guard up, planning to either reach forward and grab him if he tried to move out of the way, or to quickly stab lower if he moved his blade up to block it.

Star Lumina
Indeed, the lackey sailed past, rolling around as he hit the ground. The first mate reacted, seeing the knight rolled out of the way. Arrogance once more proved to be the man's downfall, however, as he expected to still have the upper hand. By the time Ellesandra had readied their attack, the first mate had already jumped into the air and was ready to descend upon her with a stab at her neck. But in the contest of knight vs first mate, his attack would prove the more easily dodged. A swift adjustment to the side is all Ellesandra would need to do to avoid his thrust, and all she had to do otherwise was hold her rapier out for the man to skewer himself upon.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked up upon the first mate swinging towards her. His attack was extremely choreographed, easily read. She slid beneath his attack, right hand out to catch him and rapier tilted up so that as he fell, he would fall upon her blade. She caught him as he skewered himself, hand gripping onto his chest and shoving him backwards just as soon as he landed upon her sword to avoid him trying to go for any suicidal attacks either. Ellesandra stayed mobile, quickly hopping backwards after shoving him off of her blade, and glancing between him and the pirate he had thrown for any signs of movement or hostility remaining. The sting of the cuts on her thighs increased a little at this movement, but in the adrenaline of a fight it was at the very back of her mind.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra would find the other pirate had worked his way up to his feet, stumbling. The first mate wheezed and coughed up blood as one lung filled with blood where he had been punctured. He would die in the next minute or so. The other pirate, realizing he had been all but sacrificed by his crew, and seeing two of said crew laying dead on the floor, saw no reason to swear fealty to this band of pirates any longer. He kept his weapon on him, but as Ellesandra was throwing the first mate to the ground, he was hurriedly running away into the forest, away from Cloverport, through the trees to the west. She could run after him, and likely catch him with ease. But there was no immediate threat to the plan as he ran. All his allies were back to the south, and if he intended on circling around, it would likely be too little, too late. It was about this time, as well, that a surge of mana appeared in the form of a bright blue archway that opened with crackling energy. Through it, Star and an elven woman shot forward, with a flash of light streaking from the port city to the magical doorway that saw the two of them briefly encased in bright white light before they landed, sure on their feet. Star was fully surrounded by that brilliant, rainbow energy. The sort she said would only be needed if she was in danger, as it would stop any blades from hurting her. So it seemed, not everything went perfectly to plan, and there was cause enough to defend herself. She was, thankfully, in one piece. But she also looked out of breath; doubtlessly, she was pushing herself to the limits of her mana. The radiant, rainbow energy dissipated off her, returning her to her natural state, and she then doubled over, braced on her knees, to catch her breath.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched as the other pirate ran off. She only watched for a few moments, keeping an eye on the direction he was going as well as if he was making any motion to come back and surprise her. Meanwhile she turned her gaze down to the first mate, reaching forward and pushing her rapier through his throat to make his death quicker and easier. No need to have him sputtering on the ground from gut wound; those were never fun. When the magical portal appeared Ellesandra's head snapped up, going into another fighting stance with a brief wince at the cut the pirate had gotten on the back of her thighs. It was apparent that the people coming through it were not pirates though, and after watching to ensure they hadn't been followed or anything, she straightened and leaned down, cleaning the blood off her blade with the pirates shirt. "Your Husband is back in the woods there." She pointed in the direction for the woman that Ellesandra assumed was his wife, sheathing her sword while straightening and looking back to the ladies. There was concern that shot up when seeing Star doubled over breathing heavily, but she didn't approach. There was also a little bit of shame at having let one of the pirates wound her, even if it had been a minor wound, and distrust was still apparent in regards to Star's ability to simply see past her emotional guards. Ellesandra reached for her pack, pulling out the necessary bandages and clothes to begin treating her own wounds. "Were either of you hurt?"


</p>

The elven woman was wearing a matching wedding band to her husband, along with an emerald engagement ring to pair with it. She had similar complexion to him and soft black hair that made her bright green eyes stand out against her freckled face. "T-Thank you! Thank you!" she said, on the edge of tears. Red markings adorned the elven woman's wrists in the shape of manacles, and similar red marks from what was likely rope or cloth were on her cheeks in line with her mouth. That she attempted to break free from her captivity was as obvious as the mistreatment she endured. The woman ran in the direction noted, and the two could be heard speaking after a few moments as they came together, inaudible from the distance. Star looked at Ellesandra with concern upon noticing their wounds. Her arms were trembling as she strained to keep herself stable, with sweat visible on her brow. Quite a bit of strain she endured, it seemed. "N-No, the...Captain...Came after me. Definitely tried to kill me, but I was ready for it," she said, offering as reassuring a smile as she could given her fatigue. "I can only assume he will be riling up the pirates left in the city, so we should be...Anywhere that isn't here right now. I'm sorry." She willed herself up to her feet and began to walk, still clearly short of breath. If Star's intuition was correct, the group would have a limited time frame to escape before the wide search party began to track them down. Long enough that they needn't set off sprinting...But not long enough for anyone to truly relax and prepare for the road ahead.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond to the elven woman, letting her go off and reconnect with her husband for a moment. She took that moment to pull out a small flask of alcohol and pour on the cuts she gained, clenching her teeth at the burning feeling, and then quickly beginning to wrap them up and bandage them. They weren't deep or bad enough to need more than that, a simple disinfect and wrap up to help them clot and stop bleeding. When she was done, she straightened up entirely again from the awkward position she'd been leaning to reach her own thighs, looking Star up and down to confirm she was telling the truth in regards to being fine. Nodding to confirm she at least didn't seem injured, just fatigued, Ellesandra walked up and offered her arm, in case Star was so fatigued she needed the support. "You're right. Plus, one of the pirates who followed us here ran off. I don't know that he'll go back and tell his men, but there's a possibility, which means we'll have less time than we thought. Should get your contact and his wife ready to go." Ellesandra wasn't unused to needing to move quickly, especially after a skirmish. She did glance behind her briefly at the town to see if anyone had seen them or were moving directly towards them, but beyond keeping an eye out she was just focused on getting them moving away. Pirates likely didn't have much experience tracking over land, at least she hoped they didn't, and she had plenty of experience disguising tracks. She just needed to get further away from the city to make it worth it.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked at Ellesandra's arm. There was an unexpected moment of...Decision in that. As if there was more to grabbing the offered arm than precisely just that. A flash of pain, or perhaps guilt, came over Star's face. She gave the most polite declining gesture she could, offering a smile along with the raised palm to try and assure them that she was okay. She was unsteady as she began moving to do as asked, so it might seem a peculiar decision to decline the help. Regardless, she moved to the husband and wife. "I'm sorry, both of you, but we had best be clear of this place. We should be going now, and we can talk when we're safe." Her words were not alarmist, just stating the matter at hand. The two nodded. "R-Right," began Morrun. "The elvish settlement I'm from isn't terribly far. A day's walk north-west along the main roads, we could arrive by midnight if we take the forest path," he explained, looking to Star and Ellesandra for a decision on the matter. It seemed simple, but Star still looked at Ellesandra. Obviously the knight couldn't stay here, and finding their way to a new place with a warm bed and armed guards to deter any pirates would be safest. But she also couldn't rule out the fact that Ellesandra might be feeling pushed at this point. First it was saving Star, then just to the city, then roped into helping these two...Star didn't hold judgement in her eyes, and could hardly blame them if they wanted to take this chance to walk their own path.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned when Star refused her help, but then proceeded to walk unsteadily towards the couple. She considered reaching out and taking her arm forcefully to help, but held back from doing so. Star was a grown ass woman and if she decided she didn't want help, Ellesandra was not going to push it on her. She followed behind, glancing towards the Morrun when he confirmed there was an elvish settlement not far from here. The look from Star was ignored; while Ellesandra technically had a choice, she really didn't. She wasn't going to leave these three to go find their own way. "Do the pirates know about this settlement? If they do, they may be expecting you to go that way and already be looking or tracking in that area. We may want to take a roundabout path to avoid such, but if you don't think they know, straight path there is likely the quickest and safest. I can follow a bit behind and throw the trail off." She'd learned in her training how to create false tracks and hide real ones. It was important, knowing how to throw a pursuer or kidnapper off the trail. She'd be a bit behind them so they were more exposed if they did get attacked while she was doing it, but if they waited until they were a safe enough distance away from the town they could cut down on the risk of that happening pretty substantially.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"It's not on any maps, and it is guiled in illusory magic. I doubt they know. It's not...Impossible, but I'd never assume a meat-headed pirate would be capable of finding such a place. But even if they did, the hunters of Lea'taas would see arrows in their eyes long before they reached the walls. It will be safe there, I promise," he said, a look of genuine appreciation on his face. There were few in the world who would be so kind as to do what Star and Ellesandra did, fewer still who would do so after discovering that Morrun's initial intent was to deceive the pair of them into paying an extortionary amount of money for information that was nowhere near worth the amount asked. The gratitude of he and his wife was clear. There was no trace of dishonesty to be found. Star, as well, in all her insight and power, did not signal that she saw anything but honesty in the man. "Besides. We are ahead of them now, and can remain so if we leave immediately. They were all in Cloverport. I heard talk of them sailing out within the week for another city further down the coast. They won't be roaming these wilds; there's nothing of value to thieves like them to be found for miles." Aside from the elven settlement, of course, but as established it was extremely unlikely the pirates even knew that existed unless told about it. With all said, Star nodded to Ellesandra's words. "I'll take the lead with Morrun, then, in case danger comes from the front," said Star, still winded, and taking much longer than one might expect to catch her breath. "I-I...I'll alert you of any danger while y-you...You cover our tracks. But we should...Should move." Still breathing heavily, Star gestured for Morrun to take the lead, following him with his wife keeping close behind the two. Star watched over her shoulder at Ellesandra. Partly just to ensure they were coming, but also just...More of that curious gaze of hers, this time paired with a somewhat worried look in her eyes.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded to what Morrun said. That was enough to convince her heading straight there was the right move. When Star suggested she'd take the lead in case they were attacked from the front, however, Ellesandra frowned. Their gaze raked over Star once again, searching for a wound. Was she simply that winded from keeping her magical armor up and then doing the portal? That would be understandable, especially considering the light magic she'd done just earlier, but that also meant she was probably on her last leg stamina wise. Fighting anyone who came from the front wouldn't be ideal for her. The concern was evident, even without Star being able to see the emotion itself. The concern was directly tethered to the guilt and sorrow, a fear creeping out that the past would be repeated. Ellesandra almost said something, to stop them while she covered tracks, but she held back. She was being ridiculous. She followed behind them for a bit, not immediately parting ways to hide their tracks. The thing was, if the pirates found their initial tracks that would be good; plus they couldn't exactly hide the blood and bodies of the other pirates easily. And if the one who escaped said anything, trying to hide their tracks on that ridge was pointless. No, they needed to start off in their actual direction for a bit, and only after doing so would Ellesandra drop back silently and without comment to begin covering where their tracks actually went, and redirecting them to the road that they had originally come from and where Ellesandra had encountered Star and the pirates originally. She took a branch and swept the dirt and ground to cover where they had walked, then walked in another direction, making multiple sets of tracks using different weight in each step so unless someone really looked closely they wouldn't notice it was the same person.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Whether Ellesandra's methods would be useful at deterring any followers would remain unknown for the immediate future. The only way to know for sure that the deception succeeded was to never hear from the pirates again. A favourable outcome, but there would certainly be that lingering uncertainty that they might harbour a vendetta. It was equally likely they would get drunk, throw up, and forget this ever happened. Time would tell. For now, the forward march began. Star hadn't seemed injured when looking at her. There was blood on her dress, but that was the same blood as what was on her dress from before their rescue mission. The blood from her cheek. Just small dots on the otherwise pristine silks. The concern on Ellesandra's face made Star smile in response. To reassure, or genuinely because she felt happy to know Ellesandra was concerned for her? Difficult to say, but a smile she maintained. "Are you sure you can keep walking? Do you need to stop and rest?" asked Morrun to Star. She shook her head. "Nnh, I can press onward. We can rest when we're safe," came her reply. Despite this, Morrun still offered her his waterskin, which she did accept. Her arms shook slightly when drinking the water, but she clearly needed it from how much she drank from it. Time would pass. Hours of walking, interrupted by short rests now and then. Star did eventually catch her breath in this time, and there was little to do beyond walk the road and the forested path they eventually moved into with an eye for any dangers. Wild animals could be seen, but the prey animals ran and if there were any predator animals? They certainly stayed out of sight. It was a welcome reprieve from the dangers of Cloverport for Star, but despite the rests, despite the water, despite the time...She still had clear exhaustion in her gait. She kept up, but Ellesandra was certainly correct that she was in no shape to fight. She was barely in shape to walk.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The smile did little to reassure Ellesandra that Star was actually okay. She'd seen plenty of people smile through pushing themselves too hard. When Ellesandra rejoined them, her eyes once again scanned Star up and down to see how she was holding up before focusing on their surroundings to look out for a trap or sign anyone had caught up with them. The water was a good thing to be offered to Star, and she had nodded to Morrun in thanks when he had done so. As she stepped up to walk alongside the group, she looked over to the Elven woman, obviously injured. "Will these scouts from the elven encampment have any issue with Miss Lumina or my presence? And Miss-" This time, it was directed at Morrun's wife. "Do you have any injuries they gave you that need treated right now? It would be pointless to get there if you were hiding an infected whip cut or anything that's going to hurt more to wait." She was relatively confident that she'd bought them a little bit of time with her tracks, assuming they were even following them. That wasn't guaranteed, but it was a strong possibility depending on how upset the captain had been. Now, it was just a matter of if they unluckily stumbled across any on the road, like Star had previously.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"A-Ah, I'm Lissana. Lissana Dayflower," said the elven woman, her voice meek but pleasant. "A-And, n-no, just..." she looked at her wrists. "The restraints. Maybe some bruising from when they threw me around," she said, gratitude in her eyes for Ellesandra's concern. "Some of the pirates were making...You know...C-Comments...A-About d-doing..." She cut herself off, one hand grabbing the other arm. A look of fear washed over her; blood drained from her face. "...I-It's good you showed up when you did, let's say," she said, clearly eager to conclude the matter. No tears were visible on her clothing from flogging or similar. Morrun naturally looked plenty disgusted upon hearing his wife recount such things, but he paused in his stride to let her move beside him so he could loop an arm around his beloved. "You're safe now," Morrun said to his wife, earning a nod. Then, another appreciative smile to Ellesandra. It was because of the knight and the mystic that he could say that with confidence, of course. Star didn't interject, but she looked over her shoulder at the exchange. First with sympathetic sorrow at Lissana, obviously holding nothing but dread at what might have been. But then a calm comfort, knowing they were okay. Battered, surely. Scared? Undoubtedly. But the worst was avoided. She could take comfort in having acted without hesitation and preventing tragedy. Though it seemed at this point she was pushing herself too hard; one leg gave out as she stepped, causing her to drop to one knee. She caught herself on her hands planting on the soft earth, then remained in this position for a moment, lightly trembling as she slowly, steadily tried to work back up to her feet.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Anger flashed through Ellesandra at Lissana's words. Her jaw clenched, but she forcibly relaxed it so that she didn't intimidate the elven woman. Rather than saying anything else, she let Morrun move in to comfort her. Best to come from her husband than some strange armored woman, anyways. She heard a shuffle up front and quickly looked back that way to see Star having fallen to one knee. Without a second of hesitation, Ellesandra jaunted forward quickly, ignoring the sting of pain coming from her own wound at the quick and sudden movement. In just a moment she'd found herself leaning over Star, reaching forward and placing a hand on Star's back to ensure she at least had support there. Her other hand was offered to Star to help her back up, a mixture of concern for Star's stamina and irritation at her pushing herself and refusing help coming up. It also pinged some of the grief, a reminder of someone else, but only Star would be able to see that with her ~Special Eyes~. "If you refuse help again, Miss Lumina, you only get one more chance. If you fall again, I will throw you over my shoulder and haul you the rest of the way back." The threat was made with absolute intention. It was a promise more than anything else, an acknowledgment that Star was setting a boundary about not wanting help and that Ellesandra would respect that for now, but if it happened again that boundary wouldn't matter.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The moment Ellesandra placed their hand on Star's back, the reason for her refusal to take Ellesandra's arm prior would come into much greater context. The physical touch evoked a connection. A spark of something that flowed up Ellesandra's arm. Like a wave of serene, beautiful water, it cascaded over Ellesandra's figure, bathing them in calm. In serenity. Inner peace. Of course, this came at odds with Ellesandra's own turmoil. It was not something that controlled or overrode Ellesandra's own emotion. It was simply...Comfort. Like a final exhale after hours-long frustration. Like finally being able to sit after marching for a week straight. It was...Soothing. And with that soothing feeling came an innate understanding. A recognition of the source. It was Star. Her aura touched Ellesandra when they touched her. It was not an unpleasant feeling. Quite the opposite in fact. But whether Ellesandra's hand lingered or removed swiftly would determine what followed. In the instant, at least, Star looked over her shoulder from her lowered position, up at Ellesandra, with worry in her eyes. Worry that she'd see the same closure, the same walls rising, the same...Distance from Ellesandra she saw before, as if Star was ashamed of her powers in the company of the knight.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra seemed to jump at the feeling of calm that poured through the touch. Her jaw clenched and she all but flinched away at first, finally understanding why Star had refused. There was another spike of irritation, but also...acceptance. Ellesandra wasn't going to let Star stumble the rest of the way. There was obvious displeasure, even just on her face, but she reached forward ant took Star's arm, ignoring the calm that came through the touch and working to pull Star into a standing position again. She maintained contact, her arm moving to wrap around Star's back and hold onto her, ensuring that Star could put the majority of her weight on Ellesandra if she needed it. If not, Ellesandra would simply help her balance as she walked. There were no words; she didn't need to say how uncomfortable she was with how Star's power was influencing her emotions. Even with the calming effect, her distrust and displeasure with it seemed to rise at first. Of course, if Star allowed longer contact that would go away, not enough to truly fight against any constant flow of calm, but for now - there was no way Star would miss that Ellesandra wasn't happy, but willing, to maintain contact here.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star didn't, couldn't resist the hold on her arm the helped her up. She desperately needed it. Her weight instinctively leaned upon Ellesandra, clinging to them for support. The sustained hold did bring with it more; the longer the hold remained, the more Ellesandra would be able to feel what Star felt. Star of course was able to see what Ellesandra felt. But the touch seemed to bridge that connection further, to some degree. It wasn't as intense - not that Ellesandra could know - with this passive touch. But Ellesandra would be able to feel Star's exhaustion. Not as their own. But an innate understanding of what Star felt. A knowing that one couldn't put into words. How every step was labourous. How pain shot up her legs with each footfall. Star had pushed herself beyond her limits, as much was obvious. It had physical ramifications. Things she was clearly able to push past...To some degree. That she hadn't been wincing or whining in pain was a miracle; her control over her own emotions was, perhaps unsurprisingly, quite significant. But she could not overcome the limits of her body, try as she might. Gratitude welled in her heart for Ellesandra, and Ellesandra could feel it intrinsically. The feelings did not pass onto the knight from within, nor did they require any effort to keep separated from their own emotion. The knight's guilt, their irritation, all of their own emotions remained as their own. And if the knight truly wanted, they would have no issues resisting the bond. Rejecting the sensations that flowed into them. Denying it all from influencing them would be trivial. It was not an invasive feeling. It was simply a calm, affectionate zephyr blowing through a window into Ellesandra's soul; the window would take no effort to close, even if the sensation was novel. Among the other things Star felt, if Ellesandra chose to open their heart and accept them, was...Guilt. Sadness. Loneliness. Longing. Determination. Some happiness, though it was coiled in a tumultuous storm of nuance and more complex feelings. All of this, without a lifetime of experience to decipher it, would be...Troublesome to make much sense of. To follow the threads of emotion and find their roots. The why for any given emotion was a mystery. But that the emotion was there was plain as day. And deeper, beyond this surface acknowledgement and understanding of emotion, was something more. A bridge that could be crossed. A lingering connection left separated. Ellesandra could reach out to it if they sought deeper understanding...But it begged the question whether that would be a two way street. Regardless of all that happened unseen to the two elven lovers, Star managed a much more steady stride while being supported by Ellesandra. Now that it had been forced upon her, she seemed to take it wholly, and completely. A suggestion that she wanted to take it all along...But the fear that she felt was still there. The worry. The shame. And as clear as it was written on her face, Ellesandra wouldn't even need to look at her to understand these things in the moment, so long as their physical touch remained.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected to feel what Star felt. She almost pushed away, her instinctual reaction to break whatever connection there was between them, but she didn't. She frowned down at Star's legs when feeling just how tired and physically exhausted she was. Sighing, she stopped walking, bringing Star to a halt too. She had, indeed, created a solid emotional wall between them once she'd realized she could, mostly for fear of having her own emotions flow to Star like Star's was to her. Ellesandra didn't try to delve into anything they sense in Star, but feeling that physical exhaustion she moved to stand in front of Star instead, leaning down. "On my back." The words were an order - gruff, and still irritated. Start had pushed herself too far, obviously not knowing her limits. She'd pushed herself hard enough for it to be a danger to her, and thus to their survival in getting to this elven encampment. Ellesandra was leaning forward slightly, having removed her pack and set it on the ground next to them to make it easy for Star to lean into her back and wrap arms around Ellesandra's neck or shoulders. She didn't know if Star would do so without fighting, but Ellesandra was in no mood to argue the point. She was angry at Star for not saying something earlier, and there was guilt at not realizing just how bad off Star was. She'd trusted that Star had the remaining stamina, having not known Star enough to be able to tell the signs and how far she could push herself. That had obviously been a mistake.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Feeling the support leave her side, Star nearly stumbled and fell over. But she didn't. She managed to keep her balance, then looked curiously at Ellesandra. The two elves felt it better they not say anything. It seemed this was business between the knight and the mystic. So they stayed quiet as Star lightly flushed in the cheeks. But she didn't fight. She did as asked, moving to Ellesandra's back to lean over them so she could slide her arms around their neck. Her hold was tender and thankful. Her skin was soft around Ellesandra's neck. She rested her head against the back of theirs, and eased her legs into their hold when the time came for her to be carried. Then, the emotions returned. Shame. Guilt. Gratitude. Admiration, even. Conflicting feelings that made for a difficult to unravel ball of emotion that was tightly coiled in Star's heart. But the relief was there. She was able to rest, and with that, the serenity that surrounded her grew stronger. Ellesandra still would easily be able to refute any actual influence her powers had on the other; they might recall Star had said previously that her powers of actual influence only really worked with those who didn't know her, and with how easily Ellesandra could recognize her powers for what they were, it certainly made sense how only someone unaware of who she was could actually be influenced by her against their will. But for what it was worth, Star's influence hardly was like a psychic. It didn't implant thoughts or override feelings. But it would be hard to feel violent against someone whose presence was so...Reassuring. Soothing. Calm. "I'm sorry.." came a quiet whisper into Ellesandra's ear, just for them to hear. "I didn't want you to think me a monster."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra closed her eyes, letting the feel of Star's weight lean in on her back. She hesitated for a moment, feeling all the emotions flow through again, but gritted her teeth and ensured her own barrier was up against the calming influence. Being calmer might theoretically be helpful right now, but she did not want Star's power influencing her or touching her emotions any more than they had to. She took her sack and glanced over to Morrun, tossing the sack at his feet without a word. The order was obvious; while she carried Star, he was to carry her pack. Only after that did she hoop her hands beneath Star's thighs, lean forward a bit more then pushed into a fully standing position. The cuts on her thighs screamed in irritation at the added weight, but Ellesandra kept her jaw clenched and ignored the pain. They were small enough that she knew this wouldn't do any real damage other than irritate them and cause more pain as she walked, which she could deal with. Her head turned to look at Star's sharply when Star admitted her worries. There was surprise, followed by confusion. Who in the world told Star that she was a monster? Just because Ellesandra didn't want someone peering into her emotions or influencing them did not mean she was a monster. Her power was unfortunate, and was one that Ellesandra would prefer not to interact with, but it wasn't monstrous - at least not in what she'd seen so far. "Don't be ridiculous." The words were scolding. She wanted Star to know that her being a monster was a ridiculous concept to Ellesandra. She didn't say more though, not with the two elves following along while Ellesandra began the walk again. The added weight would tire her out quicker, but the good thing was Ellesandra was used to hauling heavy sacks and equipment for long hikes. It wouldn't be a good or fun time, but she would be able to do it - especially because she wasn't experiencing any particular lethargy from haste spells or anything right now.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A few emotions came in response to Ellesandra's words. More shame. Uncertainty. Confusion. A twisted gut that cried out apology for simply existing as she was. She might be able to see Ellesandra's emotions, feel them the way an empath could, but...That didn't give clarity to the reasons for them all. The emotions of someone who was lying were obvious to her. The emotions of someone with ulterior motives almost always gave them away, even those who were stoic and adept at concealing it all. But Ellesandra's emotions were...Complicated, and forced under a pile of rubble shaped as guilt. It made it tricky to know the first thing about them. It made it difficult to know when anger was inwardly focused, or when it was at Star herself. She said nothing further on the matter, electing only to rest and try to sort through her own feelings. She didn't pry into Ellesandra's. But her presence was there, open for Ellesandra to tap into any time, even if it was the most likely scenario that the walls remained up as much as possible between the two for the remainder of the trip. Morrun did manage the pack well, only occasionally needing to stop and rest his shoulder, which would give Ellesandra some time to set Star down and limber up before the march continued. And if the knight saw no further need to speak, there would be little beyond small talk between the husband and wife to fill the air as they walked through the natural path to their ultimate destination. Eventually, Morrun ran ahead a little. A hand rose up, then weaved a glyph in the air in green arcane energy, which opened up a hole in what was otherwise a rock face, revealing a path that cut into more of the forest. It grew more verdant as they walked deeper in. More green, more alive. A subtle mana clung to the air, reinforcing the natural growth in the area. It was pleasant and refreshing, but not very strong. Still, a welcome feeling after walking for so long; the sun had set on them, and it was well into night when they arrived. Morrun kept to the front, knowing they were in safe territory, and waved to unseen archers in trees to signal them that all was well. Nothing could be seen in those trees. A lethal place for any unwelcome visitors. But their safe passage led them to a sturdy wooden gate that had vines crawling up along the adjoining wall. Their approach was met with a raising of the gate, which allowed them into the settlement proper. Given the late hour and fatigue on everyone's bodies, Morrun turned to Ellesandra and Star with his offer: "I invite you both to my home. It isn't much, but I do have a spare bed." Spare bed, singular. "...Though I won't be offended if you'd prefer an inn. I'd happily pay for your rooms, if so, and can take you to it. We don't get many visitors as you can imagine, so its amenities are sparse, but...I don't know about you, but a rock would be a wonderfully soft pillow for me at this point. Whatever the case, I will have business to discuss in the morning with you both. A matter of my thanks, and honouring the original agreement, of course."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra tried her best not to feel or notice Star's emotions. Even as they came across the apparent link, she was doing her best to not only block out her own emotions from being noticed or felt by Star, but the other way around. Just like she felt as if it was invasive for Star to just be able to SEE the things Ellesandra didn't share with anyone, Ellesandra wasn't about to intentionally or actively do the same thing in the other direction. She'd give Star whatever privacy she could to process the emotions she had. When they stopped for a rest with Morrun placing the pack down, Ellesandra sat Star on a nearby rock for easy perching and moved to replace the bandage on her thighs. The walking with the extra weight wasn't helping it heal closed entirely, so she wanted to ensure it got properly taken care of. She also took some time to drink water and hand the waterskin over to Star, if she didn't have her own to drink - and then they were walking again. Ellesandra was quiet, which was normal for her, as they passed through the apparent illusion protecting the elven encampment. She also didn't say anything when Morrun ran up to greet someone, and as they approached even closer her eyes scanned here and there, watching out for an ambush. As much as she could watch out, anyways - elves were notorious for being able to hide in trees well. She was certain she'd missed some scouts at some point, even with her watchfulness. There was a wary caution about her; trusting Morrun not to intentionally lead them into danger, but also recognizing that there might still be danger either way. When they got to the place that was apparently Morrun's home, she glanced back at Star. "Point me to the bed and I'll put Miss Lumina in it. She needs her rest, I'm afraid her mission to rescue your wife took more out of her than she admitted." There was a gentle scolding to her voice again, but it was only partial. There was no need to beat a dead horse, after all. "If it's okay with her, I'll find the Inn and get some food and sleep there. I don't think she's in any particular danger from the two of you, or other elves here, is she?" Ellesandra's eyebrows narrowed as she asked the question, intentionally making it sound like a threat that if she was in danger, they would have to deal with her.



</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was some measure of guilt on the faces of the two elves upon hearing that Star had pushed herself so hard, but it was also plain and obvious that was the case. The two could do nothing but be grateful for what was done for them. "She'll have everything she needs to recuperate, I promise you," said Morrun, earning a smile and a nod of agreement from Lissana. A bed and a few home cooked meals was the least they could provide, though there was some mild and short-lived surprise when Ellesandra opted to take to the inn. Was there perhaps an...Assumption being made about Star and Ellesandra? They didn't comment. "Neither of you will be in any danger. Even if this settlement is for we elves, we shelter others plenty. Nobody will give it a second thought. If someone got in the gates, they are welcome," he said, then gestured down the residential street. The pathways within the settlement were made of wood which gave solid foundation to support over the otherwise soft earth. Through the main street the group came to a central square that branched off in several directions, including two wooden staircases that moved up and into the trees. Looking up, several buildings and presumably residences were built around the trunks of sturdy, tall trees; many of the trees in this grove extended up into the sky like spires. Mighty redwoods left to grow for ages, the most massive of which stood at what was presumably the heart of the city, wide enough in its circumference that it might take a solid half hour to walk a full revolution around the wooden pathways that were build around it. But for the time being, the group was more focused on their grounded section of the grove. Other elves moved around, not paying much attention to Star or Ellesandra, despite those two being the shortest people around, with everyone else reaching near or above six feet tall. It being so late at night did mean the activity was minimal, with only a few other denizens of the grove showing their faces, many of them just night patrol guards donning leather armor and sheathed blades with longbows over their shoulders. It was peaceful, and it seemed there was enough of a martial presence to keep the grove safe. Eventually, the two came to a humble wooden home. Not very large, but stepping inside did bring with it a cozy feeling. A simple, warm place to live. Morrun led Ellesandra through the main living space to a side room that had a guest bed ready and waiting for Star. It was certainly big enough for two with room to spare, supporting why the elves had been taken slightly off guard by the knight's insistence to take to the inn when there was space right there to sleep for them. But no questions were asked; once Star was set to bed, where she more or less fell asleep instantly, Morrun was waiting to meet Ellesandra by the door to the room after kissing his wife goodnight. "Be along shortly, love," he whispered to his wife, then smiled at Ellesandra. First, he handed the woman their pack with a bit of a grunt as he worked it off his shoulder; he'd needed to wear it on one shoulder while his own pack was on his back, and had swapped many times during the trip. "Dunno how you can bear to carry that thing," he said with a soft laugh. "Let me walk you to the inn, make sure you have your bearings so you can find your way back here in the morning."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed Morrun, eyes scanning the trees and the surrounding elves. At first, she had her guard up high, not entirely sure this wasn't some form of trap, but as they got deeper into the settlement and she saw plenty of signs of civilian elves, not just militia or military or anything like that, she began to relax some. She ignored the look between Morrun and his wife and instead eyed the area around the house before going in for the tour. When finding the guest room, she walked around the bed to take a good look at it before turning and lowering down to lightly place the sleepy Star onto the bed directly, encouraging her to relax her hold and fall back onto the bed. Ellesandra's thighs screamed at this, both from the exertion of carrying Star this whole way as well as their wounds. She gritted her teeth, fighting through the pain of that and her muscles reminding her she didn't do the same military drills she had previously to keep in shape. She wasn't entirely surprised Star fell asleep quickly, but Ellesandra did take a moment to ensure she got tucked in and had a pillow and was comfortable. She'd also been sure to remove Star's own pack or anything extra, though she didn't touch Star's clothing. The pack was set to the side, before she turned and followed Morrun out. She took the pack back, throwing it over her shoulders again, and nodding to him. "Years of practice, you get used to it when you carry your life on your back." She didn't remember the last time she'd settled down in any one place for more than maybe a week at a time, unless on a job. And even then, it wasn't often. Her gaze went around the place again while following Morrun to the Inn, waiting for the other shoe to drop and see why he wanted to guide her or if he had something else he needed to say.


</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The walk to the inn was unremarkable. Morrun looked too tired to hold any sort of conversation. But he did genuinely want the knight to have their bearings in this place. A ways down the road from his home, then a right, then a left after some more walking, and they were closer to the central, massive tree. A few more civilians were about, but most were inside. The inn had clear signage: 'The Sleepy Seldarine'. Knowledge of elvish lore would reveal this to be a nod to an old elven pantheon, but it was little more than a name. Before stepping in, Morrun had but a single piece of business. A coin purse that he held out to Ellesandra. If taken and inspected, Ellesandra would find fifty platinum pieces inside. Each worth ten gold, which meant this was five hundred gold pieces worth of coin. "Please...Take this. For the inn, for food, for provisions, supplies..." Five hundred gold bought all that and a bit more within the first fifty gold, so five hundred was clearly for more than that. "...And as thanks for all you did. I was trying to raise the money myself to pay off the pirates, but as you can tell it was slow going. Too slow. I won't be destitute without this, before you go thinking I'm giving you the shirt off my back. But you deserve that, too. I had taken it on myself to help Star as a favour, a mutually beneficial thing. But in the time it took her to arrive, the pirates rolled in and took over and, well...You know the rest. You both will always be welcome here, but...Since you carry your life on your back, I suspect you'll be on your way before long. You've saved me from having a great tragedy in my life. If parting with a little coin can help spare you the same, then I won't take no for an answer. And something tells me Star isn't the sort to accept the deserved generosity of others." He smiled. "A pure heart like hers is lucky to have a cautious, sensible eye like yours watching over her. The world needs guardians like you. So, please. Lissana and I will be fine, thanks to you both."


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along, only glancing at the sign. She didn't know too much about elves, so the name didn't ring a bell to her. When Morrun turned to hand over a bag of coin, she looked down at it, then up to him. One eyebrow raised, having not expected to be paid for this job at all. When he explained that it had been saved up to save his wife and wouldn't be impacting his livelihood itself, she reached forward and took it without a complaint. A quick glance inside to see the platinum made her tilt her head and look back up at him in surprise. This was way more than she would have charged even if she had hired herself out for the job. "I hardly think I should be considered a world guardian." She considered the cut to her thighs and how she'd let just three lowly pirates injure her. She'd underestimated the first mate it had seemed, and his willingness to harm his own crew in order to get her. "I'll be sure to share this with Miss Lumina before we part ways." Or should she consider this her payment to help Star along in her journey? It would still be more than she'd expect from that, not unless Star was hiring her for a long journey. Still, it was an option. "Was there anything else you needed? Otherwise I would like to change my dressings and then settle in for the night, and I'm sure your wife would like your comfort this evening after everything she has been through."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun looked briefly perplexed by the notion of Ellesandra and Star parting ways. But, assumptions were cast aside and he nodded at the following words. "Of course. I don't mean to keep you. Good night, ma'am. Please come by in the morning so we can see you off." With a smile, he left Ellesandra to check into the inn. A simple process, name asked and recorded in the log book, payment of a single gold piece for a night's stay received, and key and directions given to the room. It was a comfortable room. A nice bed, simple amenities, including a magical shower that sprayed water from a blue crystal affixed to the ceiling of the small restroom that Ellesandra could use to wash away they day's woes if they so desired, either before or after sleeping. The room was theirs for the night, and a well-earned rest awaited them. Whenever they did come to find sleep, however...Their dream would find them in a waking, lucid state within it. Clearly understanding they were dreaming, the world around them took the space of a blank, black void initially. After a minute or so, focus came to the realm. A wilderness path. Not the one they had taken to the grove. Not one Ellesandra had seen before. The knight was in their full armor with their weapon at their hip, despite presumably falling asleep without it. The wounds on their legs didn't exist in this dream state. There was nobody around initially...But after looking around for a while in this dream, Ellesandra would spot someone. Or, what was presumably a person. It had a vaguely human shape, but was but a cloud of darkness. Black, smokey lines wafted up and off the figure. They were five-foot-seven, or thereabout. Not immediately identifiable as masculine or feminine in build. A vague black avatar of a person. Featureless. Unarmed. And despite the lack of eyes or anything resembling the same, Ellesandra would be able to know this figure was...Looking at them. Silent, for now, but...Watching expectantly.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra got her room and went to relax. She took good use of the shower, enjoying the water pouring on her head and letting it both wash away the sweat from the walk and the fight but also spending some time working on dealing with the emotions that had arisen that day. She tried to push them all back down into the box where they should have stayed the whole time, not coming out to hit her again at the sight and thought of Star. When she finally did change her dressings and get into bed, she was wearing just underclothes and had her armor and sword to the side, so it was strange waking up in her dream to...being fully armored. And in the wilderness. She looked around, obviously confused. Was this a dream, or something else? It seemed a bit more real than most of her dreams, but she couldn't really tell well. Typically when she dreamed, it was bad dreams; nightmares and memories she'd repressed and that only came up during her subconscious dreams. Now, she found herself staring at a shadowy black figure that she could tell was looking at her, but couldn't make anything else out about them. Her hand moved to rest on the hilt of her sword, prepared to withdraw it if needed, and she took up a more defensive posture in front of this creature. She didn't speak either, just watching it and waiting to see what it did, or if it made any hostile actions. It might not mean harm, but Ellesandra tended to be cautious and assume the worst.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The vague shadow figure didn't show signs of hostility. It simply spoke to Ellesandra, in a voice that didn't quite sound natural. The voice was as androgynous as the shape of the figure. "...She will die," said the voice. "History will repeat itself, as it does on, and on, and on again. Not tomorrow...But soon. To walk beside her in staunch defiance of fate...Or to turn and allow yourself the comfort of not knowing how, or when...I wonder which you will choose." As the voice spoke, a figure appeared before it. It was, quite obviously, Star. Bruised, beaten, bloody...But as they looked up at Ellesandra, their face changed. Shifted. It wasn't Star anymore, but the princess from Ellesandra's past. Tear-filled eyes, fear filling them as death loomed over them. Then, back to Star. Then the princess. Then Star. Shifting, melding together, interchanging with one another with swift flickers; it was a reflection of Ellesandra's subconscious association of the two women. The smoky figure remained still. But Ellesandra would find their legs chained at the ankles, with the chains taut and affixed to a mountain that was miles behind the knight. The knight could walk no closer to the smoky figure and the desperate woman that was on their knees before them. Ten feet separated them, but it was...A distance that could not be closed. Just barely out of reach. "To face the inevitable...Or to walk away..."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was confused at first, when the shadow figure said she will die. Who would die? And then the figure appeared to be Star and Ellesandra felt her stomach drop. She clenched her teeth, the rapier coming out of it's sheath as if to strike down the illusionary Star. She began to move to do so when the image changed. The rapier fell to the ground, clattering against the dirt as Star's form changed into that of Marigold's. Bright red hair was combed perfectly down her back, a single braid in a decorative circlet around the front of her head like she always used to wear. The freckles on her cheek standing out against pale skin and bright blue eyes looking down at Ellesandra. A wide smile that lit up her face, eyes that held hope and naivety and pure optimism for the world. Though at this moment, it wasn't that expression. Is the one Ellesandra remembered well. The look of surprise, tears in her eyes as she looked up at her captors, the pain and acceptance on her face as the blade was falling. "Mari!" The name, or nickname, escaped her lips without thought, as if saying it now would prevent the past from happening. Fuck, this was a nightmare, wasn't it? The image changed back to Star. From pure looks alone, they weren't very similar. But their dress, how they held themselves, their pure heart and happiness to help anyone and everyone they could, their stubbornness when they had made up their mind on something; it all struck deep. They may have different physical looks, but they were very close to the same beyond that. With the change back to Star, Ellesandra was broken out of the shock and grief that filled her again. "A dream." She said to herself, trying to stumble back away from the figure and tripping over the chains that had appeared. The normally graceful and poised bodyguard fell on her ass, looking down to see herself chained at the ankles in shock, then back up to the shadow creature that kept switching its appearance. "Get away." There was fear, there. Fear, anguish, guilt. She didn't want to be faced with the same guilt she'd been shoving down for years, and seeing Marigold's face had forced that back up so strongly that Ellesandra didn't have the presence of mind to try to mask her emotions or repress them. "Stop it."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
With Ellesandra falling on their backside, the figure changed back to Marigold. "Please don't leave me," said Marigold, her voice exactly as Ellesandra remembered it. But as soon as those words left Marigold's lips, it was Star again. But the pleading look never left her eyes. "I need you," said Star. But then was back to Marigold. One in the same, the two figures were shifting back and forth at random. The shadowy figure then extended one arm outward. In their hand formed a shadowy, deadly scythe. The tool of the reaper. The intent was obvious. "Run away," said the shadowy figure. "Embrace your cowardice," it continued. "Don't leave me!" screamed Marigold through choked sobs. Or was it...Star? Whichever woman it was, they were sobbing, crying out for Ellesandra. "Pathetic fool." The shadow figure's last words came as it swung its scythe down towards Star. But just before the scythe could strike and kill Star before Ellesandra's eyes, adrenaline spiked in their living, conscious body, and thrust them awake. It had been minutes in the dream...But the sun was rising in the waking world. It was morning.

Ellesandra
Ellesandra stayed on her ass, watching with wide eyes and mouth partially open, up until the scythe was heading towards Star. She threw herself forward, as if trying to block it, but she knew it was too late. She'd been on her ass, just watching, for too long - even if she were able to reach Star or the scythe while chained up. She wouldn't make it in time. Just as she was about to see the scythe split Star, her eyes opened and she shot up in bed into a sitting position. Her breathing was heavy and sweat covered her body. It truly had been a nightmare, one that she was sure she'd tossed and turned in. Had she screamed? She might have screamed there at the end, when Star was about to be killed before her eyes. She put her face in her hands and tried to practice deep breaths to calm her racing heart down. The sight of Marigold wasn't one that she was entirely unused to in her dreams; it wasn't the first time she'd had a nightmare of the day Marigold had died, but she usually hardly remembered the dream - just woke up from the nightmare and couldn't sleep longer. The addition of star, and comparison between the two, bothered Ellesandra. She moved out of bed and took another shower that morning; it was necessary with how much she'd sweat through the night, and to help calm her racing body and emotions. If she was going to go visit Star, she needed to get her emotions in check. There was no need for Star to see the panic and increased guilt at the idea of her leaving Star and Star dying because of it. She slammed the side of her fist into the wall and cursed to her breath. As she got out, she quickly dressed, but she left her armor off. There was no way Star was leaving today, and if Star planned to leave she was going to shove the woman back down into bed to rest, so if Ellesandra were to stay in the realms of the settlement there was no need for armor. As such, she found her way to Morrun's early in the morning wearing basic brown breaches and what would be a typical man's white jerkin, hanging loosely around the small curves she did have. Her rapier did still rest on her right hip, the only bit of her normal attire that she was wearing currently. She knocked softly at the door, wondering if this were too early to check on Star. She needed to, after that dream.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The knock was met with some shuffling and footsteps. The door opened, Lissana waiting to greet the knight with a smile. She opened the door and invited them in. "Please, come in! I was just making breakfast, I'll make some more for you. I hope you like hot cakes," she said, the elven woman clearly in higher spirits after a night's rest. Invited in, the kitchen was at the back of the home, with a dining room a bit before that. A simple table and seating for four. Morrun was nowhere to be seen, presumably up the flight of stairs to the right, possibly still in bed. The door on the left wall that led to the guest room was closed. "If you'd like to check in on Star, I'm sure she'll need a good meal as much as the rest of us. She might still be asleep."
 
</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She waited patiently, and when the door opened to Lissana, Ellesandra lowered her head in a polite greeting. "No need to go out of your way, Miss. I simply wanted to confirm Star was doing well, and then I'll be on my way. I believe the Inn has it's own breakfast too." There was a pause and she glanced past Lissana towards where the kitchen was. "Are you sure you should be up and about cooking already? If you need more rest or time with your husband to help recover, I would be happy to cook something for all of you." As much as Ellesandra wanted to rush to Star's room and check on her, she also needed to remember that Lissana had gone through hell the past few days as well. She may not have been on the verge of passing out, like Star was, but there were emotional and mental strains that Ellesandra probably couldn't see. Could Star? Did seeing that type of thing wear Star out more? She pushed the thought to the side. Maybe she'd ask at one point, but not right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana shook her head. "On the contrary! A little normalcy is really helpful. Being at home, cooking for my husband and our esteemed guests is just what I need to...Feel normal again, you know?" she said, offering a smile to Ellesandra. "I...You can bet I'll not be leaving the safety of this grove for a while. But so long as I'm here, I'll be okay. So please, don't assume I'm that bad a cook," she said with a teasing smile. "I've some fresh fruit I fetched at dawn to go with it all. Please, I insist. You and Star are the ones who need rest. If anyone would take my place cooking, I'd say it ought to be Morrun, if my darling wasn't the sort to set fire to the kitchen for trying." Another smile. A kind woman, once she opened up. Long term trauma was more likely; a hesitance to ever leave what is known and comfortable. But the woman could face that in time. For now, it seemed assuming some normalcy was the therapy she needed. She could, however, just be adept at pushing it all down, like Ellesandra did. Only Star would be able to tell, but she was still presumably sleeping in the guest bed.


</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
That made sense. Ellesandra nodded, relenting. "Okay, as you wish. I appreciate your hospitality. Don't let Morrun work you too hard though, he does deserve to do his fair share around here too." Ellesandra was joking, of course. She had no idea what Morrun did around the house and wouldn't actually judge him at all for it, either way. "I'll leave you to it while I check on Miss Lumina, but if you need any assistance don't hesitate to call out." She wanted the woman to feel comfortable around her, at least while she was here. It was entirely possible that she associate Ellesandra with death, since the first time she'd seen Ellesandra she'd been cleaning the blood of pirates off her sword. Or associate her with the whole horrible situation that happened. Walking through to the guest room door, Ellesandra gave it a very light knock. She didn't want to wake Star if Star were sleeping, but she also didn't want to just walk in without knocking in case Star was needing privacy for any reason. If there was no answer to the knock, she would lightly crack the door and peek inside, just to ensure Star was sleeping soundly and didn't look like she'd had a rough night or anything.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana gave a giggle in response. "Worry not, he's around for all the things that need a little muscle or his big brain to figure out," she said back, then moved to the kitchen to resume her cooking. A simple breakfast, really, cooked over the fire of the home's oven. There was no immediate answer to the knock. Cracking the door would reveal Star was just waking, arms stretching up over her head with a big yawn. She then opened one eye as she rubbed the sleep out of the other. She smiled a bright, beautifully happy smile to see Ellesandra peeking through the door. Even if they were mostly obscured behind it, Star clearly recognized them by as little detail as just an eye through the crack. "Good morning, Ellesandra," said Star, sleepy but slowly waking. Seemed she didn't have a rough night. But as long as she could see Ellesandra, there was that...Stare again. Her way of checking on the knight.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let out a soft breath when she saw Star waking, and doing so in a way that seemed like she was okay. In fact, she had a bright smile on her face. The sigh of relief was minimal compared to the flood of relieved feelings washing through Ellesandra. She was fine, it was just a dream. She didn't know why she had dreamt it; likely, she had a subconscious fear of Star meeting the same fate as Marigold if Ellesandra didn't accompany her to protect her. Which meant, what choice did she have? There was a grief and anxiety that accompanied the relief, thinking about the dream and Marigold, but Ellesandra wrangled that into submission like she did with all of her emotions. A bottled up, ready to overflow emotional bomb, just waiting to finally release and explode, but for now it was bottled up. Not that this prevented Star from seeing it, however. Slipping inside and closing the door behind her, Ellesandra crossed her arms and looked Star up and down, checking for any signs of continued fatigue. "Stop that." Her eyes met Star's, at that stare that she was giving her. "I get that you can't control that you can see or maybe even feel what's going on in me, but stop actively trying to understand." A boundary she was at least trying to set. Though despite how abrupt her words were, Ellesandra wasn't angry. Nor was she ashamed of Star or what she could do. No, there was more...fear. Not afraid of Star herself, but afraid of someone seeing into her. Of asking questions. Of pushing her to process things she still wasn't ready to do. "How are you, fatigue wise? Do you need help getting out to the table for breakfast?" And a quick topic change, trying to encourage Star not to go down that route of conversation or ask why Ellesandra was so protective over how she felt.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star could see the emotions. The relief. The concern. It told her something was on Ellesandra's mind. Some guesses popped into her head, but she never assumed such things if she could help it. She was about to ask, but then the knight interrupted her before she began. She blinked, then blushed a little, and maybe even pouted a tiny bit. Understanding people was sort of her...Thing. Core to her being. So to have a wall slam down over it was clearly frustrating. Confusing, even. She heard the questions, the shift in topic. But Star was a bit too stubborn to just let them lead her along like that and pretend they hadn't said anything. "...Yesterday morning I told you what I saw. And you told me that there is no mountain," she said, her voice kind and gentle. Sympathy overtook her features, replacing the pout. "So...As far as I can see, until you point it out to me otherwise...There is no mountain," she said, speaking in words that only really made sense to the two of them. "That won't stop me from seeing the way the winds blow around the shape of what certainly isn't there. There's only so much I can willfully blind myself. And even that...I have no shame admitting that it doesn't sit well with me. But I do now, and always will, respect your privacy on the matter. I won't ask...But if what led us into the whole situation yesterday is any indication, I can't see suffering go unanswered. So at the very least...As long as we're together, I'll be watching. Even if there's nothing I can do...Sometimes it's just nice to know someone cares." She smiled, then swiftly sprung up from the bed, using Ellesandra's own quick diversionary tactics against them as she shot up to her feet. "As for my fatigue? All gone!" she said, beaming bright. "The only reason I was so drained was because I'd sapped almost all my mana for what I was doing. Casting the spells on their own was strenuous enough, but, ahehe...Casting spells in quick succession makes them exceptionally more taxing, and I only had seconds to do what I was doing to ensure we got out safely, so...Point is, I'm recovering! Not back to full strength I admit, but, I'm not sore any longer."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's jaw clenched. Anger spiked at Star's words, though it wasn't really anger at Star. It was the grief of what that mountain was masking itself as anger because that was easier for Ellesandra to process. If she pretended the mountain didn't exist, she didn't have to deal with it. The comment about a mountain reminded her that she'd been chained to one in her dream, and the idea made her blink her eyes and turn her head to the side. Had her eyes teared up, just for a moment, before she blinked it away? No way to tell now, as Ellesandra was quick to turn after Star hopped out of bed to display how well she was doing now. "Good. You need your food then. Come out when you're ready." She could respond to Star's comment about someone caring, about being able to tell there was a lot Ellesandra was not saying to or showing her, but she didn't. Instead she slipped out of the room, leaving the door closed behind to give Star any privacy she needed. Ellesandra didn't go immediately, though. She took a moment in the hallway to ensure she was fully in control again, that her eyes weren't about to tear up once more, before walking down the hallway back towards the kitchen.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star didn't need to see a tear to see the emotions that caused it. Her expression remained sympathetic in the face of the tears, in the face of the anger, all of it. It wasn't like this was the first time someone had responded, well, emotionally to her stance on the matter. She almost expected it at this point. Star did take some time to get ready, namely by making use of the shower the elven couple had attached to the guest room. When she arrived to join for breakfast, her hair was damp and weighted down, but clean and pretty as could be. Her dress seemed to have had the blood removed from it from when Star woke just a handful of minutes earlier and now. Magic, perhaps? Regardless, Star took a seat just as Lissana was coming out with plates. Hot cakes, as promised, with two kinds of berry jam, a refined elven syrup that was sweet and earthy, and a large bowl of fresh fruits and berries to enjoy on their own, or perhaps to garnish the hotcakes with in the case of the berries alongside the jam. Adding to this, some meat sausage was divvied up on each plate to add some protein to the meal. The food was simple, but wholesome, and the elven cuisine had a hallmark elven complexity to the simple dish. Cold milk and orange juice was offered to drink alongside. Overall, an enjoyable meal that would give a good deal of energy for the day head. Lissana called up for Morrun once she laid out the plates, then joined the other two. Morrun shambled down the stairs, having clearly not slept the greatest, and joined the others with a smile after kissing his wife good morning. "So, Star, Ellesandra," began Morrun as he grabbed one set of cutlery to poke at a hotcake and take from the communal pile of them that was placed in the center. There were enough hotcakes for each person to have three of the medium-sized treats, but Lissana didn't look like a big eater. That, plus the huge helping of fruit meant there would certainly be leftovers unless Ellesandra had a bottomless gut. Morrun put some syrup on his hotcake. "What is the plan from here? I owe you the information promised, which will undoubtedly shape the next leg of your journey. I don't mean to rush, but I also don't wish to hold you up, so...If you intend on staying a while, as much can wait until after breakfast I'm sure. But I still am curious, if it's not prying to ask. Just, well...It would be nice to know that bright horizons await heroes like you both."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra would have offered to help set the table, but by the time Star came out she had been sitting in her own spot, having put her hair back up in a ponytail like it had been the latter half of the day yesterday, and staring down at her hands clasped on the table in front of her. Her fingertips were callused, hands rough; the hands of someone who had worked their life. Not just the hands of a warrior, but someone who had done manual labor as well, wielding tools as well as weapons. Her hands tightened as she struggled with her emotions, the bottle seemingly having sprung a leak. When Star sat down, she looked up and met Star's gaze for but a moment, but she couldn't look at Star long. Not while the memory of Star and Marigold's faces replacing one another was so present in her mind, from the dream. She looked away, happy for the distraction when Lissana came in with the breakfast and began placing them down in front of them. Ellesandra had leaned back, being respectful and waiting until Morrun arrived and began eating before she touched her own food. She was ravenous, and wasn't ashamed when her stomach had growled at the prospect of finally eating after the long day they'd had yesterday. She started with the sausage, quiet as Morrun began speaking. She glanced at Star for a moment, then back to Morrun. "For my part, it depends on Miss Lumina here. I'll be accompanying her until her mission is complete, so it's how she would like to proceed." It was a decision she'd come to, an easy one, after that dream. Even if it had been her subconscious bringing that image up, that she'd be running away from Star and dooming her to the same fate Marigold had, which made the decision easier, she knew she wouldn't have been able to just walk away. Not when Star so clearly indicated she needed the help. She didn't meet Star's gaze after saying this, eyes returning to her plate and using the food as a distraction to prevent meeting eyes or being questioned about that decision.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The surprise on Star's face was obvious. She looked at Ellesandra. If they had been alone, Star would have quite a few questions about when all this changed. But now she was facing down two elves where were...Also having trouble understanding. Morrun in particular had been told just last night that they were parting ways. Or did the knight mean in the eventual conclusion of this? It was vague, and very much not something he was about to bring up and possibly cause confusion or hurt feelings on the matter. So eyes went to Star. And at that point, Star just decided to not look a gift horse in the mouth. She had been struggling since she decided to venture on without Nina - a non-violent woman in a violent world, after all - so having Ellesandra was as comforting pragmatically as it was emotionally. It had only been a day, but...Ellesandra was an easy person to admire with the way they faced danger. Star also couldn't help but notice that her knightly companion couldn't look at her. But she didn't draw attention to it. As she said...There was no mountain. "Oh, uhm, well," Star began a little nervously. "I was hoping the information you had would lead me to a way to get to my home plane. I was told you had information about that, so I guess our plans depend on the details of what you have to share, Morrun," she said, specifically using 'our' in her words. Since Ellesandra was in it for the long haul, apparently. Happily joined, if confused about it, Star remained. Morrun nodded, pausing to finish a mouthful of hotcake before answering. "Right. Well. Let's finish breakfast then, and I can tell you all about those details. I don't wish to get your hopes up massively, but I will do all I can to help you along, all the same." Smiles were exchanged, and little more than small talk joined in on breakfast through to its conclusion unless Ellesandra had more to offer. The lion's share of the food was the knight's to have; Morrun and Lissana both turned out to be light eaters. Star enjoyed her share, a bit more than she might normally as she was recovering her strength, but seemed to prefer the fruit. Not that she didn't enjoy the hotcakes and sausage, but even with the hotcake, she smothered it in berries and seemed to delight in specifically the taste of the blueberries, with her face lighting up with delight in each bite. A favourite food, clearly, as unless others were grabbing them, she specifically sought the blueberries out to take for herself, looking a little sheepish and asking if anyone else wanted more before helping herself to the last of them. This left plenty for the knight to enjoy, and the group remained until it was clear all had their fill. Lissana then set about cleaning up, and Morrun and Star moved over to the living space so they could discuss what Star came here to learn in the first place. Star shot a glance at Ellesandra, inviting them to join along and hear what Morrun had to say.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had, at first, just taken one hotcake and otherwise added a lot of the fruit and sausage to her plate. She had eaten the hotcake without any of the jam, though as the meal went on and she saw how Star was reaching for the blueberries, she separated them on her plate and stopped eating them. As the conversation went on and Morrun confirmed they would discuss later, Ellesandra mostly tuned out the small talk. Oh, she was listening, but only for key words, her name, or if anyone addressed her specifically. Instead her eyes were down on her plate, eating in silence and trying her best to keep that 'mountain' bottled back down. The dream last night had really fucked with her sense of emotional stability, and that on top of how they had already been stirred up by Star herself. In all reality, it was probably Star's presence that had caused the dream. When she'd finished with what she was going to eat, and after Star had asked if anyone wanted the last of the blueberries, Ellesandra deftly lifted her own plate and moved to sit it in front of Star. It had what was remaining of the blueberries Ellesandra had gotten, properly saved to the side once she'd realized how happily Star had eaten them. She didn't say anything with the sharing of the food, but instead drank some of the milk that was provided and turning to Morrun, speaking up for the first time since the small talk had started, and simply asking him a couple of questions about the elven settlement - what it was like, the people, and how it defended itself against people like the pirates. Small talk that would distract from the small gesture of kindness, one that Ellesandra did not want to be commented upon. As they were finished and were moving to the living space to discuss the next steps, Ellesandra stood. She helped Lissana collect the plates and all the cutlery at least, but soon left Lissana to doing her normal duties and getting back into the swing of her normal life while moving to stand near the entrance of the living area. A habit of hers gotten from years of being a bodyguard; standing near the entrances and scanning the room, but not sitting to relax as part of the conversation.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was a woman of emotion. That much was obvious. But even firmly knowing that, it might come to surprise Ellesandra that the simple act of thoughtfulness and kindness was enough to bring Star to tears. Actual tears. When she saw what the knight had done, the tears ran down her cheek. She took a moment to herself, dabbing a napkin against her eyes as she collected herself again. Her bright smile and giggles and assurances that she was fine were enough to keep the elven couple from worrying too much, but it was still quite the reaction. She enjoyed those last blueberries on Ellesandra's plate most of all, savoured one at a time. It resolved without incident, and things moved back to business. Morrun sat on the couch, facing Star who sat on an opposing seat, and both of them gave odd looks to Ellesandra who stood by the door, but neither questioned it. Morrun began with a clearing of his throat: "Right. Well. A bit about me, I'm a scholar of the planes. The Material Plane refers to central planes that are surrounded by inner and outer planes, as far as the scholarly understanding goes. But there are quite a few planes that qualify as Material. I understand from the description that you're from another such place, Star," he said, earning a nod from Star. "Right. So, to reach another plane like that requires some strong magic, or a portal. From what I observed, you were capable of using Dimension Door, the telltale door-like creations of that spell are quite obvious. Would you perhaps be capable of making stable portals for yourself?" asked Morrun. Star gave a small nod, though with a rub at her neck. "Yes, though...That's a bit tricky, and can be taxing to do. I'm still learning how to do more advanced things like that," she said, giving a nervous laugh. "No matter, no matter. That you're at least that familiar is enough. Because, well, the main thing that has had my interest as of late is that, about a year ago, there was some commotion a ways north-east of here. Along the coast, but at least another two days on the road on foot. Maybe one if you can go by coach. There were some ruins there, and some very curious individuals showed up to examine them. A band of adventurers, looked like. But notably, they had ears like a fox atop their head. Pointy and fluffy. Not terribly uncommon, but they uniquely did not have tails to accompany those ears. Combining that with their clothing and magic I observed them using, and I have it on good confidence they were from Myst." He paused for effect here. Star just...Blinked. This meant nothing to her. Morrun cleared his throat again. "...Myst is a plane outside the regular cosmology of the array of Material Planes. It's its own pocket of the multiverse, said to have been created a long time ago by someone known only as the Wizard of Myst. This place is host to interdimensional travelers, not unlike the githzerai or githyanki, though far, far less war-like than the githyanki. Myst, by contrast, is a place said to house two things that I think will be of great import in your mission to find your home. First...It is known as the city of gates. It is said if one can get to Myst, they can get anywhere else in the multiverse. Anywhere. From Faerun to Eberron to Ravnica to Dragonlance...Anywhere." His insistence was made clear by repetition. "And if you don't even know where to look? Well. It also houses what it calls the Athenaeum. Said to be the single greatest collection of knowledge in all the multiverse, a library of infinite and impossible proportion, if there is any knowledge that exists on where your home is, Star...It will be there. So. Though it has been quite some time, it may be your best bet to begin looking where these people have been, these travelers from Myst, and by whatever means you see fit, be able to follow them to Myst and, from there, go where you need to go. Of course...If ever that leads you back here, you'll have a bed waiting." A smile. "I'm...Afraid I don't have anything tangible on that regard, however. Myst is said to have a magical cipher that protects it from unwanted travelers, and of course a race of ancient elves that guard it, which is in part, how I learned of it. There is an elder elf here in this grove, Master Ridoru, who spoke of reveries he has had about being part of this legendary band of elves, known as the Arethi, in a past life. Not that I think knowing more on that front will help you find Myst, but...I'm sure if you feel the need to talk to him, I could secure an audience."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had NOT expected that reaction. She'd snapped her head up when she saw tears and there was a mixture between panic, confusion, and guilt. These emotions weren't attached to the normal guilt that Star might sense in Ellesandra, but separate. Had Star not wanted the blueberries? Was there something wrong with giving them to her? Why were there tears? Still, the rest of the meal seemed to go on past that, but the confusion and guilt didn't entirely go away with Ellesandra making a mental note not to randomly share food with Star again. She wasn't good at emotions, certainly not her own and definitely not others, so it wasn't easy for her to tell if those had been good or bad tears. As Morrun began explaining the magic, Ellesandra felt her head hurting a little. She understood some magic, being a spellsword of her own, but others she didn't. And all this interplanar stuff was way beyond her knowledge or experience. She knew some basic things, like there was a plane where you went to when you died, that Kelemvor would guide your soul to it's appropriate afterlife - whatever that might be and whoever you might worship - but anything in depth she didn't. The idea of this Myst place, somewhere that was apparently a gateway to any other plane, was a good start though. If Star knew the specific plane they needed to go to, they'd perhaps find a way to travel there from Myst. Her gaze went to Star, letting the mage lead the conversation for their side not only because this was her mission, but also because she knew more about it. Ellesandra did offer a - "We do have some funds available for travel, should someone in Myst need it, Miss Lumina." This might be news to Star, so she felt like it needed to be shared. She hadn't yet shared the coin Morrun had given her the night before with Star intentionally, but she would once they were out of the city.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star considered the information at length. She was surprised to hear that there were funds available. She of course had a bit herself, but she hoped to get more while in Cloverport. That didn't pan out quite the way she hoped. She was still getting used to the idea that Ellesandra was even coming with her, so that, plus now having money? All variables to consider. "I see," she said, curiously looking at Ellesandra. Not to study their emotions, but just to convey her pensive nature. Her eyes flicked to the floor, just picking another spot to look at that wasn't the knight, to keep them from being uncomfortable. "Hm. Well, it certainly sounds promising, and since I won't be able to do anything with portals at least until I am back to full strength anyway, a day of travel suits me fine. If we have the funds for travel, that helps...But I don't suppose coaches often travel from this grove, Morrun?" she asked, which had him think for a moment. He blinked. "No, the closest place to secure a coach would be..." He went a bit white, then. "...C-Cloverport. R-Right.." A nervous chuckle followed. "Right, well...Uhhh...Surely there's something else," he said, racking his brain. Star giggled, waving a hand. "I'm more than used to life on the road. We can instead use the money for some extra rations for the road to supplement what I can get from the land." A comment from Star that had Lissana poking her head out of the kitchen: "I've already put together some extras we don't need that you're taking with you, and that's final!" she said in a sing-songy voice. So it seemed the money could be saved for when it was later needed, if all that was secure. Star looked at Ellesandra. "Well. Unless you feel like going back to Cloverport to risk running into our lawless friends again, I'd say we have some walking to do, and only so many hours of daylight to get to it. What say you?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head sternly when Star indicated they might go back to Cloverport to hitch a ride. No, that was a horrible idea, and not one that Ellesandra would allow Star to follow without a very good reason. However, when it came to starting off walking, she crossed her arms and looked Star up and down again, assessing her physical condition. "Are you absolutely sure you are in a fit state to start off today, Miss Lumina? You were barely able to walk straight yesterday evening and you crashed as soon as I laid you down on the bed. It may be best to rest for another day at least before we head out." Ellesandra wasn't entirely sure what urgency Star was under. It seemed she didn't know if her mother was alive or dead, but there didn't seem to be an immediate urgency since Star had been willing to go out of her way to save Morrun's wife. Or perhaps that's just who Star was and she would have done that even if it was urgent, but Ellesandra was unsure. She narrowed her eyes at Star, trying to give off an intimidating presence despite her smaller 5'1 form and the threat having no real backing to it, since she wouldn't hurt Star. "I'm not going to let you tire yourself out like that again unless it's absolutely necessary. I understand it was a magical exhaustion yesterday and you're much better after your rest, but with how bad it was I'm not sure you should be travelling on foot today."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star pouted a little, but she still listened to all Ellesandra had to say. Sure, she could use another day of rest. But... "Mmmnh, it's not absolutely necessary, no.." she conceded. "It just...Feels wrong to be idle without just cause. Obviously the cause of rest is important, but.." There was nothing to follow the but. She obviously saw the wisdom in Ellesandra's words. The rest would be good for her. "Your legs should be rested, too, so I guess we'll have to. But will you at least let me tend to your wounds, if I'm agreeing to rest completely? My mana might as well go to some use," she said, trying and failing to put up any sort of attitude. Star was too sweet for any amount of pouting or dispute to be taken as angry. If Star actually got angry, it would be obvious. This was just...Pouty that she was being forced to be idle, forced to listen take the wise choice instead of the ambitious one. Sure, it could be that nothing happened on the road. But something just as easily could, and not being fully rested could be the difference between life and death on the road.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was glad Star relented to not start the journey today, though when she suggested she should heal them, Ellesandra frowned again. The idea was reasonable, but she didn't know that she wanted to risk Star using her magic right now. She tilted her head to the side, considering. "This evening before you go to bed, IF you are absolutely confident your energy has restored and will be fine if you do it, you may tend to my wounds. Otherwise they're fine; I've received much worse than that without being treated for much longer, and I've treated these to ensure the bleeding stopped and they were disinfected. Additionally, they aren't even that deep, so no sewing necessary." While it was true that they weren't bad injuries, it was also true that Ellesandra wouldn't want to have to fight again with them still. It would effect her ease of movement, but only a little. Enough to allow Star to heal them? Maybe, only if Star was confident in her recovery of mana.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun had a bit of a smirk about him as he listened to the two go back and forth, but remained silent about it. Star focused on Ellesandra, not able to see the wayward smirking. "Deal," said Star, then shot a smile at Ellesandra. "...So what do you want to do until then, Ellesandra? I mean as fun as I'm sure guarding the door against all the law abiding civilians out there is, there's no reason we have to just sit on our butts all day, right?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a flicker of amusement in Ellesandra. On her face she didn't show it, not even a curling at the corner of her mouth, but Star would be able to see that the question and poking fun at her guarding the door amused her nonetheless. She sighed, as if very put upon, and said - "Well, I guess we can walk around and explore the settlement. I've been many places but I've not been to an elven settlement like this before, most of my interactions with your kind -" She had begun looking at Morrun as she said this, but paused as she realized how that might have sounded. There was an internal self-kick and a wince. "Er, I mean. I didn't interact with Elves much, and the trees are beautiful." That was a weak recovery, but there had been no malicious intent in the comment. Instead, it was more just an inexperience with elves in their natural culture, versus when they'd already assimilated into other nations or cultures.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star seemed pleased with the idea of walking around among nature. And smiled even brighter when she saw the amusement rise in her companion. So they did have a sense of humour after all. How pleasant.~ Star then watched with second-hand cringe as Ellesandra said 'your kind'. Morrun didn't seem put off by it in the slightest, however, even with the weak recovery. A shrug was all he had to offer. "Elves are not everywhere. Our connection to the Feywilds ensures we always maintain reverence for nature, though it's nothing compared to that of a Druid camp. The magic they can cultivate for natural splendor is unparalleled. But it's true, we do invest our time caring for the nature here. Lissana does much more with that than I do, though, as she learned to speak with animals at a young age," he explained. Star giggled at this, though she didn't explain why. Maybe she just found it cute to imagine Lissana talking about her day to a squirrel. Star then rose from her seat to stretch. "Mmnh, well, we'll leave you for now then," said Star. Morrun nodded. "Dinner will be at sundown, I invite you both to join us, please," he said, smiling again. Star nodded back, then moved to Ellesandra, ready to move out the door and go walk around for a while on their day off following their heroic rescue. Though, once the two did move out of the home and the door was closed, Star abruptly turned to pull Ellesandra into a hug. "...Thank you, Ellesandra." The sharing of physical emotions that came with physical contact of course came along with this, and within Star's heart there was...Overwhelming gratitude, all of it for Ellesandra.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked at Star with confusion when Star giggled in regards to Lissanna speaking with animals. She wasn't quite sure what was funny about that, looking back at Lissana, before shrugging and following Star out the door. She had started to turn to Star to see if there was anywhere in particular the mage wanted to go when she felt Star abruptly pull her into a hug. Ellesandra froze, statue still. Her arms were out to the side like someone who had gotten hugged and been surprised by it, and she was looking at Star with wide eyes. The feeling of Star's appreciation, gratitude flooded her and kept her rooted to the spot, and it took her a moment to realize what was happening and recover from her shock. When she did, the barrier on her emotions that she'd worked at maintaining all day yesterday, while carrying Star, slammed back in place to prevent Star's emotions from piling in and calming her again. She took a deep breath and lightly wrapped one arm around Star, patting her back in the awkward 'there there' motion of anyone who was unused to physical touch like this. "...Come on." She said, motioning with her head down the path for them to begin their exploration of the area. She felt awkward and confused with Star hugging her, and she could feel the way it caused her heart to skip a beat and the guilt and grief that began to stir much further down. She didn't want the hug to continue, but she didn't push Star away, either.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a small worry in Star's heart that she might get pushed away. The worry would pass along, though the reason for it would remain nebulous to the knight. Just another emotion in the chaotic storm of emotion that they were exposed to when touching Star. A storm that would be difficult to unravel for even someone well versed in their own emotions, so for Ellesandra? It all remained a confusing mystery until it was blocked off. Curiously, the act of drawing the division was easier on this day. It appeared to be a skill one could hone as they grew more familiar with Star's magic. A skill that would allow them to either better make sense of the chaos and noise in her emotions, or to block her out more completely. Control, in essence, was afforded with exposure. Marginal for now, but noticeable. Ultimately, Star held the hug for a short while, concluding it with a gentle squeeze, and parted with a smile. Star obviously could tell that it was difficult for Ellesandra. The discomfort, as if a hug was alien to them, had Star wearing sympathy and understanding upon her features as hands daintily folded behind her back. "...For staying," she began. "For walking beside me, instead of continuing on your own path." She then wore a brighter, happier, slightly playful smile. "...And for the blueberries." A giggle followed. "I guess it's pretty obvious how they are my favourite, isn't it? You probably felt like it was nothing. But in both the small and big moments, I have seen nothing but kindness in you. And it makes me really happy to know you." She let those words linger for a moment, hanging in the air. She debated speaking in terms Ellesandra understood, in saying her piece and then abruptly changing the subject to deter the other person from saying anything about it. On one hand, she considered that a kindness for the knight, to not force them to face the genuine emotion in Star's words. But on the other, she feared that saying what she had, and then immediately setting off to wander around like nothing happened would stifle Ellesandra further and reinforce the notion that emotions weren't a conversation, but just a series of random statements said at will and not to be discussed further. So, she elected to leave the silence to linger, so Ellesandra could decide how they wished to respond. She expected them to just clear their throat and pick a direction to start walking, and if that is what happened, she would be fine with it. But on the small chance Ellesandra had a response, Star didn't want to take away their chance to say it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pursed her lips together, eyeing Star when she finally pulled back with that gentle squeeze. There was part of her that immediately missed the contact. The part of her that had been touch starved for years now, having little to no real physical contact with people. Even when she'd taken lovers the past few years, it had been her touching them - not much of the other way around. The thought was pushed out of their mind and Ellesandra turned to look down the path, not meeting Star's eyes at all the thanks, and the comment about her kindness. She took the desire to be touched again and shoved it down, letting that discomfort with the whole situation be the main emotion Star would see - or at least, that's what she tried to do. She had no idea how much Star could see, or if other large emotions blocked sight to the smaller ones. "Yes, well." She said, clearing her throat awkwardly. Changing her plan for the money Morrun gave her for them both, she reached for the pouch that had it and unhooked it, tossing it over to Star. "I've been paid for my services, and part of that is making sure my client is happy. If blueberries make you happy, it is my duty to provide." It was a cop out. A guise to hide behind, in that her kindness or actually wanting to protect Star wasn't true, but just the job and the duty expected of her. Hiding behind duty was easy, even if a five year old could see through the lie. As the one hiding, it helped ease Ellesandra's emotions to think of it this way. "Morrun paid us for the rescue. I took my pay, the rest is yours to use." This also wasn't true. She hadn't taken but one platinum out of there, to use for her inn room last night and to test to ensure that the coin was good. Of course the platinum had been overpaying and she'd gotten change in gold but still. Ellesandra didn't even consider how easy it was for Star to tell she was lying, that thought not even being a consideration as she began walking away from Morrun's house, choosing that moment to go with the 'end the conversation and walk' path. "Lets go see the sights, it's not every day you get to roam an elven settlement."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had a bit of a fumbling reaction to catching the coin purse. Her hands were behind her when it was thrown at her after all, but she did catch it. She frowned, looking at the coin in the bag. Then went wide-eyed. That was...A lot of money. It became quite a bit less so when dealing in magical items which could gobble up the wealth for just a few modestly useful things, or even all on one single thing of modest value or rarity. She then looked at the house Morrun and Lissana owned. Guild began to rise in her own self. Not something Ellesandra would be able to see on her aura, but certainly on her face. Of course, the only thing she could think of with this is how much it could improve the lives of the elven couple. "I'll take a few coins and return the rest, then, since you've taken your pay," she said aloud, quite thoroughly justifying Morrun's intuition to pay Ellesandra. Goodness knew that what Star 'needed' was a paltry sum out of the pile. Five coins maybe. And not that Star knew it, but doing so would certainly expose Ellesandra's lie about taking their pay. And that didn't even begin to touch upon the way Star looked at Ellesandra after this statement with a face that clearly said 'if you're going to lie to me at least make it convincing' as she considered the cop-out line about blueberries. It was almost enough to get Star to lash out at them. But she'd only known Ellesandra a day. She feared being too insistent on the matters of emotion, about insisting on honesty, would push them away. She had, less than an hour ago, learned that Ellesandra was staying with her until she concluded her mission. A promise that...She wasn't sure Ellesandra fully understood, given how long Star had been at this already. But one she desperately needed. So she swallowed her emotions and simply said, as Ellesandra was walking away: "...There is no mountain." She then drew in a deep breath, huffed through her nose, and turned to catch up with the knight. Curiously, the pouch of coins was nowhere to be seen. Star also didn't carry a pack, as Ellesandra would have noticed while they were moving from Cloverport to the elven settlement. Did she lose it? Where were her supplies? Did she toss the coins into Morrun's home when Ellesandra wasn't looking? She just had her dress, as if that were her only possession. That all aside, she walked beside the knight in their plainclothes. The settlement was of decent size, but more vertically sprawling than horizontally so. The exploration revealed a fair amount of services the elves had; a smithy with a few workers, several bakers, artisans, a small library, a small prison, and a handful of other sorts. There didn't seem to be any sort of tavern or analogue for it, though there was a shop selling fine elven wines, some aged upwards of fifty, even a hundred years if the two poked their head in to peruse the wares. It was decidedly civilian, with enough similarity to human settlements to make it feel familiar. Beyond the services, however, there were communal spaces for the elves to gather. Places for them to be together, be merry, to sing and to dance, places to hone their accuracy with bows and form with blades. A place for the children to learn and be safe. The occasional elf regarded the two humans walking among them with curiosity. Another, with knit brows. Racial lines did breed strife on occasion, but as Morrun promised, there was no overt hostility. A few hours passed as they traveled around, taking in the sights and sounds, though it all carried a familiarity that prevented anything from standing out enough to linger on. They were just finding ways to idle the hours away, it seemed. That was until they found their way to the far side of the settlement, which had a bountiful garden to behold. Star's eyes went wide, and she sped along ahead of Ellesandra to step onto the walking path laid out with mosaic stones that passed between two rows of flowerbeds that were adorned with flowers and flora of all colours and sorts. Rainbows of blooms arranged with careful precision that sought perfection in the craft. The stone path led forward onto an open, grassy field that had patches of flowers dotting the greenery. It was a beautiful meadow, one that Star giggled with glee as she ran into, did a pleasant, happy spin on one leg, then let herself fall onto her back onto the soft earth. The sun glittered down onto the meadow, casting god rays through the trees to illuminate it in its warm glow. Some other elves were in the distance in this large meadow, keeping to themselves and simply living among nature. But at least for the moment, Star was occupying a little slice of the meadow to herself, obviously elated by the natural beauty on display.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned at Star's comment about returning the rest. "Take at least half. If nothing else you can find uses to donate it to on the journey." The request was made as more of a suggestion. She would prefer Star have the funds necessary to ensure safe travels, though also knew that Star would want to use the money for other kind acts in the future. She could spread that out, leaving some for the elven couple and then using it on the road as well. The no mountain comment made her visibly flinch. Her teeth gritted and anger rose, anger and denial swirling around the mountain that was obviously there, even if hidden and ignored by Ellesandra herself. This made the first part of their journey through the town not very pleasant for Ellesandra, working to rein in said anger and focusing more on that than enjoying the sights around them. The smell of the bakery got her attention, that and the smithy were the main things Ellesandra was looking at when not doing base scans for danger. Despite this being essentially a day off for them, she was still with her charge and thus needed to ensure no surprises were waiting. Ellesandra was quiet on the little tour of the town, impressed with the way they integrated their entire culture into nature but otherwise it seemed just like any other town. When they made it to the gardens and the meadow, she was taken aback by how much Star seemed to enjoy it. Running forward and spinning in the fields, Ellesandra found herself watching the just pure unfiltered joy in star with envy. She didn't remember the last time she'd been able to feel joy like that. A sinking feeling sat in her chest again, one she couldn't identify. Loneliness and regret was there, but it had been long enough that Ellesandra let herself feel either in this context that she didn't even realize what it was. Instead, she found a bench or a stump or something to sit on and settled down, watching Star just laying back in the meadow for a moment, before glancing around to see if there was anyone else around they might be disturbing. Keeping guard, like normal, with the same stoic expression as always despite the aforementioned feelings getting stronger.

Star hadn't seemed too keen on the idea of taking half. As kind as Star was, she had moments of being stubborn. The coin bag was gone, either way. Star literally could not help noticing the anger, but she didn't speak to it. She did think on it, however. And happy as she was, there was a desire to share it with her dutiful knight. Sure, it was possible there was danger, but they had been assured this place was safe. And it wasn't like Ellesandra was in their armor right now. Not that she'd want to take them on in a fist fight regardless, and felt pity for anyone who tried, but there was a mild poutiness about Star with how Ellesandra didn't have an off switch. "Hey, Ellesandra, get off your stump and come lay in the grass with me!" she called out, briefly propped up on her arms. She pat the grass next to her, then smiled. "It's a beautiful day!"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had sat on the stump just as much to keep distance from Star as to keep an eye out. Yet when Star propped up on her arms to invite her out, Ellesandra stared at her with a mixture of confusion and amusement. Why did Star want her to spend time with her like this? Ellesandra had proven to be a grumpy, unfun person so far hadn't she? Yet Star continued to try to pull her in. She didn't answer for a moment, watching Star and then glancing around the fields, before sighing in acceptance and standing. "As you wish, Miss Lumina." She could still hide behind the job, doing what her client wanted, in the form of her acceptance here. She walked forward, careful not to crush any of the flowers in the meadow - or as careful as she could be, anyways. She turned and lowered herself to sit next to Star's laying form. She didn't lay down, but did lean back on her own elbows, looking up at the sky rather than at Star next to her. "It is a beautiful day." She relented, agreeing with the comment.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star paid particular attention to how Ellesandra didn't trample the flowers. It made her smile, though from the knight's point of view she was just smiling because, well, Star did smile a lot. She was a happy person, generally. Until something sad happened. Then she was sad. As if she had some sort of empathetic magic or something. But she did happily welcome the other to her side. She knew touching them was...Not the knight's favourite activity, so she refrained from helping herself to using their lap as a pillow, despite the urge. Instead, she laid back, hands resting over her abdomen. "You can just call me Star, you know. I keep waffling about matching your formality and using your last name and saying that's silly and just using your first name. I've decided to just use your first name. So you should do the same." She smiled. "My mom gave it to me, after all. Picked it specifically for me. Be awfully rude not to make use of it, don't'cha think?" she asked with a playful voice, looking up at her companion. It was flimsy logic, but she clearly knew as much and just wanted to be called by her first name regardless.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a sudden pain that rose in Ellesandra's emotions at the mention of Star's mother giving her her name. It was enough that Ellesandra actually showed a response on her face, eyebrows coming together and her mouth creasing into a frown. She still didn't look at Star, remaining in her position until it became uncomfortable on her arms, and then leaning back entirely to lay down in the grass. She wasn't quite sure how to respond at first, wanting to decline Star's invitation to use her first name, but not knowing how to do so without insulting or offending the woman - or her mother, considering what Star had just said. So instead she pushed the memories of her childhood back down so the pain wasn't up front again, and nodded. "As you wish, Star." Her words were a whisper. A gentle give to the formality that normally was insisted upon to keep an appropriate distance between her and a client; something that she couldn't find she could enforce with Star. Star just had too much positive energy and happiness to deny her something so simple. She took a moment to glance around, not letting her guard down despite laying in the grass with Star, before looking back up to the sky. "Must be beautiful here at night, with the stars." A topic change. Still something more than she normally would have commented on, but it was a give and take. Give that, prevent questioning into the pain that she knew Star probably saw at the mention of a mother giving a child their name. Just another part of that mountain which didn't exist.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was smiling at first, but then frowned when she saw Ellesandra do the same. She had touched something there, hadn't she? She couldn't know, of course. Only know the other woman's hurt. She knew the knight's game by now. Every comment was calculated. It was a difficult topic to broach...She still didn't want to risk pushing the other woman away with inquisition. So she went along, this time. She would have to choose her moment, if she ever intended to try and chip away at the cold armor on Ellesandra's heart. "It's what I was named after. My mother's name is Aurora. My grandmother was Luna. Great grandmother, Aelia., which means 'sun'. My home has a lot of connection with the celestial bodies. The beauty and mystic grace of it all...My mother told me of how it is the destiny of my family line to bring light into the lives of others. She told me a story of how a single, guiding, bright star in the sky guided her to the woman she'd eventually come to marry. My...Other mother, Robin, didn't survive until I was born, I know that much. But my mom, Aurora...She said that I was that star that guided her, and descended from the heavens to be with her once I did." She giggled, tears having formed in her eyes. She was smiling, but...It was clearly painful to talk about, given the situation. "So every time I look up at the stars, I make sure to look for any bright ones. See if maybe there's something up there trying to guide me." She sniffled. "I know it sounds silly. But since we'll be here for the rest of the day...Let's come back here to look at the stars tonight, once the sun sets. See how beautiful it really is."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over at Star when she heard the sniffle. She eyed the water building in Star's eyes, and without a word slid her hand into a pocket and pulled out a handkerchief. It was silver with gold threaded emboss on it, of the same type of designs as was on her armor. There were initials on it, M.K., in the center. It looked relatively fancy, especially for something that the knight would be carrying around. She handed it over to Star to use to help dry her eyes before looking back up to the sky. "That's a lovely story." The response seemed...well, Ellesandra had more to say, there was more that she could say, but she didn't. It was all withheld, restrained. Instead, Ellesandra leaned her head back into the grass with a deep sigh, closing her eyes. "Returning tonight sounds like a great idea." They could probably return after having dinner with Morrun and Lissana, since they'd been invited there. Ellesandra wasn't sure about imposing on their hospitality more, but it seemed like it would be rude to refuse. Even if she was staying in the Inn rather than their place, with all her stuff still back in her room at the Inn, refusing their food seemed unnecessary. "Have you found any bright stars up there, guiding you?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
If Star didn't have the intuition to know that Ellesandra felt more than they let on, she might be offended by the curt response to her story. She accepted the handkerchief and did use it to dry her eyes, then admired the stitching on it. She sniffled again. "This is...Really nice," she said, taking note of the initials. M.K...Unless Ellesandra had a completely different name, it wasn't theirs. So...Who did it belong to? Whatever the case, it was important enough to keep, so Star would not dare sully it with anything more than a few teardrops. She held it gently, with a clear reverence, as if she implicitly knew it was very important to the knight at her side. Not much could get past her in that regard, after all. So it was handed back with care once she was done with it. Even if her eyes were still a bit wet, she dare not use it more. Then, the later question evoked a small nod. "I did, once. It led me to Nina. She's been a very good friend over the years, and that's a story you might find familiar, as I found her in the midst of peril and saved her. She's returned the favour plenty over the years I've known her. And she found love, or at least...For a while, she did." Star shook her head. More to the story, clearly, but not important enough to get into. "Of course I know it's just a silly coincidence. But there's something to be said about it happening twice. Maybe it'll happen again. Maybe it'll happen enough times that I'll have a much harder time just believing it coincidence."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The comment about the handkerchief being nice was ignored, at least verbally. Ellesandra obviously heard it because the grief, and the guilt, all hidden beneath the large mountain of repression Ellesandra had, leaked out a little. Marigolds handkerchief was the only physical thing Ellesandra had left of her, so yes it was quite important to her. She kept the conversation going beyond that though, ensuring that her talent at avoiding those conversations didn't go unused. She glanced over at Star, curious as the story was told. She wasn't certain, but she'd gotten the impression Star and this Nina might have been involved themselves, at least as much as you might with a travelling companion in a friends with benefits way. The indication that Nina had found love, at least for a time, made Ellesandra curious how Star felt about that. She didn't ask though; it wasn't Ellesandra's place to ask probing questions when she herself would refuse to answer any similar ones. "Maybe it will. Even if it doesn't happen again, doesn't mean that it was coincidence. The gods and goddesses work in weird ways, and with how your entire family seems to be named after and related to the stars or celestial bodies in some way, I wouldn't put it past the appropriate Deities finding favor within your family and sending you messages that way. Or just playing around with you."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The confirmation that the handkerchief was important came not from a physical tell, but, as was often with Star, an emotional one. Good that she was careful with it. A rag, she might have blown her nose on. Never would she dare use that precious keepsake for anything in the future, even dabbing her eyes. She sniffled again, then giggled. "I would hope they aren't playing around with me, if that is the case," she said, then looked back up to the skies. "...Have you ever had anything like that, Ellesandra? Anything that seemed to be like a coincidence? I mean...Other than you stumbling across me being in danger, of course. I have to wonder how much fate had a hand in that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged. "It's luck, or it's fated by the gods. And I don't much care for putting my life and my destiny in the hands of the gods; spiteful prideful beings who would use people like us and then throw us away. So there have been times that I've been lucky; I've gotten very luck in my life time, being able to be trained where I was and accepted into their ranks." Her comment was offhand, vague enough that Star wouldn't be able to get too much detail from it, but it would be obvious from her that what Ellesandra mentioned was something that she'd been grateful for, at the time. She still felt grateful, for whatever she was referencing, even if there was still pain in the memory. She waved her hand, dismissing the notion and idea. "Things happen, if they're fated then no point in fighting that, but if they're not then I'm going to make my own decisions and let luck and coincidence fall where it may."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star listened quietly, keeping an eye on the woman for their emotions as the story went on. Gratitude was a nice emotion to see. It had her smiling, though she could only imagine that such gratitude came from an upbringing that was more destitute. A person born in privilege feels they deserve everything they get, after all. She didn't mention this, but she made the quiet assumption to be confirmed some other time. "Quite the pragmatic view on it all. I've never been particularly pious, so I don't have much to say for or against the notion of the gods. I'll just have to take your word at their dispositions." There was an odd disconnect about bad stuff being gods and good stuff being luck, but again, she didn't say anything. "It's not surprising that you are someone who seeks to take control of their own destiny, though." She smiled. "We have that in common. I like that about you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra knew gods could bring about good stuff, too. They just hadn't for her, and it wasn't dependable. You could make your own good stuff. Most of what she'd seen the gods do had been negative, in some form of fashion. Not that she had much interaction with it at all, anyways, she was just biased. At the last comment, Ellesandra finally looked back over to Star and raised her eyebrows at her. "Take control of your own destiny? Didn't you just say that you were looking for a star that a deity would use to guide you to your next...I don't know. Lover, if that's what happened for your ancestors, or just friend?" She sounded amused a little. Maybe poking fun at Star, but only lightly and not seriously. Testing boundaries, more like, as she looked back up at the sky. "What do you have planned when you find your mother?" When, not if. She believed Star would find her mother, though if she was dead it might not be in the way Star wanted to find her. There was curiosity about how they got separated anyways, but again not something that Ellesandra was going to pry into.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was smiling bright as the two talked. It felt like for perhaps the first time, she was holding a conversation with Ellesandra that was about them, not just the situation they were in. Even at the subject of her mother, she didn't lose her smile. She giggled at the light prodding. "Just because I seek guidance where it might present itself doesn't mean I am not fighting for what I desire. I think I've proven that I'm not averse to taking risks. I think you'd be a lot less stressed out being near me if I was," she said, prodding back to the woman with a playful smile and lilt to her voice. "And, well...I've never been in love. Not aside from love for family, of course. Romantic love." She was still a virgin, but she wasn't about to go saying that out loud. "And not for lack of meeting people, mind. Maybe it's just the vagrancy, but...I've never felt that way about anyone before. I've felt...Attraction, certainly. Enough to know what kind of people I'm attracted to, though that's always been kept inside. Never uh...Told someone I, you know...N-Never mind. But I'll always take more friends. Making friends wherever I go is how I like it to be. As for my mother? Well....Depends on if she is alive of dead I guess. If she's gone, then I will just need to make sure I care for her legacy, and that she is properly set to rest. If she's alive...Then I never want to be separated from her again. N-Not, you know...Like live with her or something. Just make sure that I can see her regularly. Learn from her. Understand myself better," she said, looking down at herself as she did. A pensive introspection overtook her. "...You can't really know what it's like to be born like me, of course. I've had this gift since birth. Mom helped me understand it, but there was a lot I had to figure out on my own, too. It's...An intuitive thing. Not something that you can really explain. But certain things just click after you focus on them for a while. At first, I remember reading an aura was really hard. Just a...Chaotic barrage of emotions constantly. Lots of headaches, and trying to make sense of things that rejected understanding." An apt description of what Ellesandra felt, to a very mild degree, whenever touching Star as the power connected their auras. Confusing, despite the comfort. "But over time, little by little, having experiences with people helped me understand them, and understand me by extension. I've been lucky, too. Lucky that a lot of people have helped me, yourself certainly included. So...On one hand it's a little selfish of me, as my mother is the only person who can really help me with this in a way that isn't just me figuring it out myself. But that aside?" She closed her eyes. "...She's my mother. I love her. And she loves me. I know she would come for me, if she could. So either she is out there looking for me, and we haven't found each other...She's dead, and can't look for me...Or she needs help. Whatever the reason, I have to find her and know for sure. It's..." She paused, pursing her lips as her eyes opened again. "...Have you ever felt like...You can't move on with your life? Like something holds you back from doing that? For me, that's...This. I need this. Then...Then I can think about settling down and having a life that is more about me. And I hope to help a lot of people out along the way."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra listened as Star rambled about her lack of being in love, and her interactions with people as that. It caused her to raise her eyes again, but it was more curiosity as to why or how, and not judgment at Star's inexperience with love. It sounded like she might not have told someone she was attracted to them, either, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. It certainly wasn't her place to pry into how many people Star had been with, sexually. She was silent as Star transitioned into speaking about her mother, and what she'd do when finding her, and her powers. When Star asked that of her, though, she reached to the side and picked a single flower, holding it up above her head and slowly curling the stem round and round itself, up the stem until it created a much smaller stem that was stronger, but obviously different from how it had started. It curved to the side instead of going straight down, and Ellesandra picked another flower, curling it's stem around the first. She was making a circlet of flowers, though it would take quite a few more than just two, and she wasn't in a rush to complete it as they lie there. The silence stretched, the unspoken mountain rumbling with the pain, grief and guilt over what Ellesandra herself couldn't move past - what was holding her back. Her eyes were focused on the flowers in front of her as she worked, but the whispered words came out. So softly that Star might wonder if she'd imagined them. "There is no mountain." She clenched her jaw again, and suddenly crushed the start of the circlet in her fist, tossing it to the side and sitting up, back to where Star was laying. "You take risks like what you took for Morrun and Lissana, and you very well might not make it to finding your mother." Now her words were scolding, a defensiveness for the little she'd just opened up in and slammed that look into her emotions back down again, overcorrecting. "So don't let your helping others distract you from finding your mother, if you want to actually do so."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was quietly smiling as she saw Ellesandra weaving a circlet of flowers. It was cute. Though, she watched as the tranquility, brief as it was, was overtaken by defensive anger, frustration, and a myriad of other emotions swirling in the knight's aura. The flowers were crushed and the woman was defensively faced away from her. The words that followed didn't hurt Star, like they might have been meant to. She kept calm in the face of them. "I know," she said quietly. "But I...Like who I am. Not that I don't have my failings, of course. I've plenty of those. But I like...That I am not afraid of dying for a good cause. Obviously I'll try to do all I can to avoid that and...I know I have no business flinging myself at something I have no hope of surviving. I pick the fights I know I can take, even if I recognize I might get hurt along the way. Knowing what would have happened to Lissana if we hadn't intervened...I'd make the same decision a million out of a million times. There's...Enough suffering in this world that I am forced to turn a blind eye to. So...As much as I'm able to," she said, moving from laying to being on her knees. She then moved behind Ellesandra and, with as gentle a motion as she could, embraced the other woman from behind, looping her arms around their neck to hug their shoulders and collar. "I want to give people their smiles back when something has taken it away from them. I'm no miracle worker, but...It's a promise I keep to myself, that I will always do everything that I can." With that, she didn't wish to overstay her welcome. A small squeeze, then slowly retreated from Ellesandra, unless she saw reason to keep the hold.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't look at Star, even as the mage seemed to brush off her words. Her knees came up and she wrapped her arms around them, leaning forward away from her and staring out over the meadow. Her rapier was at her side, awkwardly putting pressure against her hip from the way it angled against the ground, but she didn't bother repositioning it. In a way, the discomfort that brought helped ground her. The thought came into her mind, that even if Star was willing to risk her own life for it, she might not understand how her death effected others too. She didn't say it, because it wasn't really Star who Ellesandra would be saying that too. It wasn't really Star that she was thinking it about. The grief bubbled up, enough that she'd been distracted to the point of not expecting Star's touch. The embrace caused her to jump, both physically and emotionally surprised at the touch. The calmness wasn't welcome right now and she pulled away, moving to stand as if she had been planning to do that the entire time and lightly pulling Star's hands off of her even in that quick squeeze. She took a few steps away and then stopped, unsure what to say. She was being dramatic, wasn't she? Shame, but she really didn't like how her emotions went haywire when around Star. And how when Star touched her, she was afraid Star would be able to see the memories associated with those emotions. Without a word, she returned to her stump, hiding behind her 'duty' again, and looking anywhere around them except at Star herself. She withheld the tears that were on the verge of springing to her eyes, but at the same time she knew that didn't matter with Star. Star would see the grief anyways, and that angered her. She couldn't even hide the emotions from the woman like she could everyone else, to get them to think she was just being moody and leave her alone.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Indeed, Star had to find a balance between respecting Ellesandra's boundaries and not allowing the obvious grief and anguish to go unanswered. That mountain was looking a whole lot more existent right now. She had been given a clear signal by them pulling away, but something...Beckoned Star to keep at it. She was confident Ellesandra wasn't going to hurt her, of course. She worried about losing their allyship, but...If she was willing to risk her own life for a stranger, she was willing to do at least as much for someone she had come to care about as a friend. So she followed to the stump. She sat, cross-legged, in front of Ellesandra, looking up at them. She didn't say anything for the moment. She just looked at them. Of course, Ellesandra knew that her looking at someone was almost always her looking at them.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected Star to follow her. Her lips pressed together in a firm line, frustration and irritation at Star's silent insistence. She knew Star wasn't just looking at her, was waiting for her to open up, or to be able to see and understand more about her emotions. "Stop it." The thought of Star staring at the emotions that she didn't even want to feel right now bothered her - a lot. Her feet came up to rest on the edge of the stump and her knees pressed to her chest, as if somehow putting her legs between herself and Star would prevent Star from seeing into her as well. It was ridiculous, but the instinct to protect and cover herself was still there. She felt naked, exposed beneath Star's gaze and it was not something she was comfortable with right now. "I'm not going to talk about it, either." She added this, knowing that even if Star looked away, she might try to bring the topic up. Ellesandra found she still couldn't actually look down and meet Star's gaze. Instead, she held onto her knees and looked out over the field, the grief slowly being pushed down by the irritation and anger. Okay, maybe Star pushing it was good; it helped her focus on those emotions rather than the grief.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I'm not asking you to talk about the mountain that isn't there," she said, undeterred by Ellesandra's emotional response. "I just want to talk to you. I was enjoying that," she said, her words as honest-to-a-fault as ever. "If you insist that I leave you be I will but not until you listen to me." There was a firmness to her voice, one that spoke of emotional conviction. But she was still being gentle. She didn't want to actively anger the woman of course. But some emotional grit was to be expected with such a sensitive topic. "You decided to help me. You saved me from coming out of that a lot worse than I would have. Maybe even saved my life if things went terribly wrong. You stuck by me, and each time I was ready to let go of you, to not impose on you, you stayed beside me. Despite both of us knowing the dangers we were up against, you even stood by me as I pledged to help a man who was at the time a total stranger to us both. And from the moment I laid eyes on you I have seen..." She paused. "...You know what I've seen. And I'm still not going to press you on that, as much as it makes my heart bleed to pretend I don't see it. I know I don't afford the privacy of emotion that many are used to. I know it's hard to know someone sees it. But it's just as hard to be someone who sees someone so kind suffer. And before you try to hide behind some sort of honour that forces you to be the way you are, just...Remember what I see. Remember that I see through lies of even adept liars and...As kind as I can possibly say it, you're not a very good liar," she said, offering a smile at that. Her words might have conviction to them, but she did her best to remain gentle. "So I'm...Not asking you to confide in me, not asking you to spill secrets to me. I'm just asking you to...Hear me when I tell you it's hard to fight against every fiber of my heart that begs me to see what's right in front me, but I do it because you asked me to. But I have to draw the line, Ellesandra. When it gets to be too much, I...Don't need you to open up about it. I just want to be able to support you. We can talk about anything else, if it helps. Because it just...Isn't fair that you can be there for me, constantly, when I need you, which has been far more times in one day than I care to admit...And I'm not allowed to do anything at all for you in return. You went and stepped into my life and now you've got me caring about you. And if I'm willing to risk my life for a stranger, just imagine what I'll do for a friend, let alone one who saved my life." She looked at Ellesandra, pleading with her eyes. "...Just let me be here with you and talk about...Birds, or flowers...Anything."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned. The mountain wasn't there, but Star kept mentioning it. To be fair, Ellesandra mentioned it just a few moments ago, too. With a deep breath, she put her chin on the top of her knees and closed her eyes, hearing the firmness of Star's voice. She wouldn't give this up, and pushing back would either start an argument or Ellesandra would have to simply walk away. And if she walked away, what would happen to Star? She wouldn't be able to live with herself if something happened to the mage that Ellesandra could have stopped, but she just walked away because being in Star's presence was hard. The dream came back to her and irritation rose in her once again. It took a few moments, and honestly with the words that Star cared about her making it easier, Ellesandra calmed herself down. She resigned herself to having to deal with Star knowing that she hurt, but she didn't need to know why. "Fine. You can see it, but the topic is off limits. That is a firm boundary, Mi-...Star. You will not pry, or try to trick me into talking about things that I have no desire to relive or discuss." She opened her eyes, looking back down to Star. These weren't requests. They were clear statements that if Star didn't think she could follow, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could travel alongside the mage. Regret and fear came up at that, worried that Star would refuse and Ellesandra might be forced to face the dream she'd had again. The guilt at someone dying because of her inaction. "And give me the handkerchief back, if you're done with it." Ellesandra hadn't forgotten it. She didn't care if Star's tears or even snot was on it; she'd clean it the next opportunity she had, but she didn't want to let Star just keep it for now. Especially not with the tension between them and the current irritation at Ellesandra feeling like that mountain, which she always pretended wasn't there, kept getting poked by Star's comments, brought back to life, and Ellesandra was not prepared for the emotional onslaught that would be once she stopped repressing it entirely.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star blinked, looking at her hand to find she was holding onto it. "Oh, erm...S-Sorry. I meant to give it back," she said, handing it back. It only had two tiny tear spots on it which were mostly dry. She heard the 'Mi', and upon handing the handkerchief back, was reminded of the initials. Was she...Being associated with someone from Ellesandra's past? She couldn't know. And she wouldn't ask. "Ellesandra...I said right when we got onto the road together that I wasn't going to press you on this. Do I...Want to know? Of course. But I'm not going to force you. Being who I am, I've had to learn when it is appropriate to...Make use of the knowledge I have from the power. I'm not perfect of course but...I at least have tact enough that if someone says they don't want to talk about something...All I can do is just say...I'm here, if they change their mind. And that I do want to help. But that's all I can do. And I would hope it had gone without saying but...I'll say it so you can hear it: I'm not going to trick you. I'm not going to mislead you, lie to you, intentionally lead you along some conversation path hoping you'll slip and tell me something you don't want to talk about..." She shook her head. "If you ever, ever feel comfortable talking about whatever it is...I want it to be genuine. I want it to be only because you want to share with me, and no other reason. It would make feel sick if you ever felt I was...Manipulating you. I told you I...Only ever will be honest with you. Even if the truth isn't pleasant, or what you want to hear. It will always be the truth, and I will always hold the best intentions towards you. I swear this, all of it."

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She took the handkerchief back. A second was taken, running her thumb across the initials, before she folded it up neatly and slipped it back into her pocket. The grief and guilt, so intertwined, threatened to rise again. They were pushed down and she folded the handkerchief up, putting it back in her pocket and moving to sit up right on the stump again, feet on the ground once more. "Good." It was the only thing Star would get in response to all of her confirmation and reassurance that she wouldn't pry. That she wouldn't try to manipulate or trick information out of Ellesandra. Ellesandra was uncomfortable with Star being able to see her emotions, but there wasn't anything she could do about that. Setting this boundary, verbally and getting agreement on it rather than just assuming Star was too good of a person to push on it, was important for her. She looked down at Star for a moment, then stood. "Lets continue walking." She needed to get away from where they just were, where she'd felt so raw there for a moment. Whether or not Star followed, Ellesandra moved back onto the path and began just walking alongside the meadow, not necessarily leaving it but not going to lay back down in the flowers, either. Movement felt needed, to help process and distract herself, so that's what she was doing. "So, recap our next destination and travel plans for me, assuming you are fully recovered tomorrow and good to start the journey?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star loosed a soft breath, glad that they reached an agreement. She obviously could tell there was more pain lingering, but all she asked was that they keep together and not fall silent. She got at least that much, made clear as they got up. She joined them, walking alongside. The question had her recounting the details. "I'll be having Morrun mark my map with where we'll be going. It'll be about two days of walking north, hopefully without any major issues. From there, we need to find details, clues. Find some information about these people Morrun said he saw, who come from Myst. Or in general just...Get to Myst, however we can. From Myst, he believes we can get to my home again. Once we're in my home...There will be a lot of work to do to find out what happened, starting with the...Ruins of what was once my home."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"Ruins of what it once was? What happened to it?" Ellesandra led them on a path that seemed to run alongside this meadow for a while, but when they got to the end of it, she turned around and began walking back down it. The meadow was beautiful, and Star had obviously enjoyed it, so she didn't want to just walk away and prevent the feel of the nature and the environment from being enjoyed. She needed to move, but no reason it couldn't just be along this path. A glance was given over to Star at the question, but she didn't push. Just like she'd requested of Star, if that type of information was painful for her or she didn't want to discuss it, who was Ellesandra to push on it?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Unlike Ellesandra, Star was an open book to her companion. She wore a smile, but it was...A sorrowful one. "It's how I got separated from my mother in the first place. We were attacked. My mother was known in our region as a powerful magic user, and I was a little too young at the time to really understand it all, but...I think it's fair to say that she attracted some powerful enemies. My mother ran with me, we tried to escape as the other magi held off the attack. But they pursued. Laid waste. Razed our village. I remember flames and blood falling from the sky." She paused here, looking over the beauty of the natural land as she kept walking with her companion. "I remember seeing the fear in my mother, in her aura. She was the strongest, so...She had to fight. But she also had to guard me. The choice of being idle and protecting me, or going out and saving anyone she could from our village. Those are the conflicting emotions I remember seeing in her. I told her to send me away, for her enemies did not know she bore a daughter. It was the only way she could protect me, for if she fought and died, or the enemy retreated with knowledge of me, I would always be in danger from them." She closed her eyes for a moment, holding down her sorrow. Then opened them again. "So she did. She opened a gate and sent me through it. It was a plan made in the moment. She sent me far, far away, and I had...Hoped she would be able to follow me afterwards." Her voice was starting to get a bit stiff, a bit choked. "But a day turned into a week, which turned into a month, then two, then six, then a year, two, five, ten..." She shuddered, closing her eyes tight. Tears streaked down her cheeks. "I don't want her to be dead, Ellesandra...I don't. I don't want her to have died fighting for us all. I don't want to have to regret not begging her to come with me, even knowing the evils would have followed her." She choked a sob. "...So please do not warn me of what I already know...That the enemy may be waiting for me there. I need to do this. With all that I am, I need to return to her side. And I need to pray with all that I am that she still lives..."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected all of...that. When she'd heard the first choking noise, she stopped, turning to look at Star. Regret filled her, at asking this question and making Star relive this. She shouldn't have, and as she saw how much it effected Star, she couldn't help but try to fix it. The thing is, she didn't know how to. She looked around, as if suddenly, magically, someone else would appear to comfort Star. To say the right thing, and make her feel better. She'd never been good at this, not even before the mountain was there. Looking back to Star she wavered for a moment, and then stepped forward. She had her barrier in place, to try her best to block the sorrow that was evident in Star's face from hitting her at the touch, but she would offer her arms for Star if she wanted the hug. She did not touch Star first, though. She made the offer and indication apparent, arms spread and ready to wrap around Star if she decided to lean into the embrace, but she knew enough about Star's ability by now that she wouldn't touch Star without her permission in this situation. It may not be an emotion Star wanted to share, and even if Ellesandra was guarding against it, with something this strong could she not feel it at all? Her face was conflicted, and there was definite hesitation in the offer, but if Star needed a shoulder to cry on, Ellesandra would be it. "I won't warn you." Ellesandra said, even though she had thought that. "No matter what is waiting there or not, we will find it and see what happened to your mother." If Star did accept the embrace, she would wrap her arms around the mage and guide her head onto her shoulder, lightly squeezing. Awkward, but still supportive.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra might be the sort to be hesitant to physical touch, but Star was the complete opposite. The moment a hug was offered, she went flush against them, the comfort evident as her aura connected to Ellesandra. The raw sorrow was there. But it was an emotion Ellesandra could know was not their own. Putting up a barrier kept some of it out, but it was too powerful to avoid the sensation entirely. It did not evoke sadness in Ellesandra specifically. But just with all the other emotions, it was there, able to be reached out to. It was quite like seeing Star cry, except it was Ellesandra's heart, the core of their emotion, 'seeing' Star's sadness. It was a visceral feeling. If Ellesandra cared about Star, then genuine sorrow was a natural consequence. Nobody liked to see someone they cared about sad, and this connection only amplified that. Of course...Not everyone reacted the same way to sorrows. Perhaps, instead, that raw sadness would evoke...Protectiveness. Anger, at the ones who caused this sorrow. Or perhaps even courage, to stand up against the sorrow and be the devout rock that supported Star. Her power was not manipulative. It simply...Connected their hearts together. With happiness, it was often infectious. With the tranquility of her aura, it simply spread through the other. But there was much less tranquility to find in this moment. Her sadness, even with the guards held, was...Intense. A sorrow that ripped her apart inside, enough to overcome her and leave her shaking. Yet, Ellesandra could feel the way that the hug gave Star comfort. Without a word, it was communicated how the knight's embrace was like a dam against the tsunami. Star managed to wrangle her emotion enough to keep her sobs minimal, and it would be something that Ellesandra would be able to glean insight into as she did so. To be able to see that Star felt far, far greater sadness than she showed on the surface, if Ellesandra allowed themselves to look, even briefly, into her heart. It stood to reason that an empath was in great control of their own emotions, and yet the sadness was potent enough to cut her to her core; she certainly would and did cry over lesser things, but this sadness was, in many ways, similar to what Ellesandra faced. A feeling that overpowered her. That coursed through her very soul. A shackle that held her. Paralyzed her. As Ellesandra held the weight of a fallen princess upon their shoulders, Star was burdened by the weight of the unknown fate of her own mother. Yet, she did not feel an ounce of anger, or regret, or any negative feeling towards Ellesandra. She did willingly share her story, the context of her adventure. Where the knight felt they had overstepped, Star held a small, thin thread of...Relief? Yes, the pain was deep. But she was able to express it, and there in Ellesandra's arms, the edge grew duller. The icy cage around her heart melted, just a little. Each moment Ellesandra held her, her heat managed to beat just a little warmer under the grips of this terrible memory. Star dare not take more than she was given, but...There was a clear, obvious desire to remain close to the knight. And if the stalwart knight did hold her long enough, it would allow Star to again find her center and level her breathing as sorrow slowly...Slowly, but surely...Gave way to gratitude, and a deepened bond with the woman who held her.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took in a deep breath at the sorrow that she felt through the embrace as soon as it happened. Even through her emotional wall, she could feel how sad this memory and what happened made Star. It felt extremely odd, seeing this, and she wondered if that was how Star experienced Ellesandra's emotions when she looked at her. Ellesandra did feel that protectiveness come up, the desire to ensure that Star didn't feel this way again - to protect her from the feeling that she was trying so hard to protect herself from, too. Anger wasn't a big part of it, only a bit of anger at whoever did this but it was so background it likely wouldn't be noticed. Ellesandra slowly let her arms fully encircle Star and just held her, eventually reaching up and running a hand through the back of Star's hair. The desire to protect this woman was almost overwhelming, wanting to just squeeze the sadness right out of her and make her happy and jumping into the meadow again. Of course, Ellesandra couldn't do that - and wouldn't try. If anyone looked their way she gave them icy glares to ensure they kept to themselves and didn't interrupt as Star let out her sorrow. She didn't say anything, no soothing words or reassurances that most people would provide in this situation. She just held Star, letting her cry it out. Her own sorrow twinged in response to how much she'd seen and felt in Star, and how holding Star reminded her of holding Marigold, but she pushed it down. Unlike Star's sorrow where she couldn't just squeeze it out of the woman, she COULD just push her own sorrow down. And that totally got rid of it, right?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The hold that Star gave to Ellesandra was tight. What Star showed outwardly was not representative of the depths of this sorrow, that much Ellesandra would certainly feel. It ran deeper than choked sobs, tears, and needing a hug. It was the sort of sorrow that led the typical person to nightmares, to dangerous thoughts, to all the dangers of deep, all-consuming sadness. Guilt, as well, was significant and present. It wouldn't be hard to figure out why - Star likely felt personally responsible for all of this, whether it was true or not. Nobody bothered the two of them. If anyone saw it, they steered clear. Such was the polite thing to do, after all. Despite the darkness Star felt within her, she remained an empath. A master over emotion. So it wasn't long before she managed to subdue her sobs, regulate her breathing, and find a calmer place. Her hair which Ellesandra brushed their fingers through was...Remarkably soft. Silken threads of snowy white, pure and untainted by dirt or oils that would make the threads heavy or rough. "...Thank you," Star whispered from her place still holding Ellesandra, head against their shoulder. "I know you aren't the biggest fan of touching, because of what happens when we do. But it feels...Nice...To be held by you. I feel safe with you."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra almost jumped when Star finally spoke. It had been obvious she'd been slowly bringing herself back together, but the whispering had surprised her. She squeezed tighter for a moment as Star spoke, and she had been just about to release Star, hold slackening and her body moving to let go, when she heard Star said that she felt safe with her. There was a pause where it felt like her own heart had sunk into her chest, words that had no ill intention whatsoever but obviously had a pretty severe impact on Ellesandra. She squeezed once more then stepped away, releasing Star and looking away from her. Her own eyes were misty now, and it had nothing to do with the sorrow she'd felt in her companion. Her jaw clenched and she reached for the handkerchief again, handing it over to Star for her now splotchy nose and eyes. She pressed it into Star's hand, if Star tried to refuse it. "Why don't we sit? Take some time to recover before you go back to Morrun's. He'll get the wrong idea if you come back looking like you're heartbroken." Star had been right. She hadn't liked the touching, and especially not when Star had said the last words she'd heard from Marigold. It took a lot of willpower to close up that wound again, looking away from Star who, while looking nothing like Marigold, reminded Ellesandra so much of her. Ellesandra couldn't continue to hold Star and risk her being able to get a better look into that emotion. She had mentioned before that for particularly powerful ones, she could sometimes see the memories associated with it - and THAT was not something Ellesandra was ready to share, verbally or otherwise. There was real fear on display in Ellesandra right now, fear that Star would be able to see straight through everything she was trying to pretend didn't happen. Everything that she refused to accept, in one way or another. Through that mountain that didn't exist. Without a word, Ellesandra made her way over to one of the benches alongside the meadow, sitting on the very far edge of it to give Star plenty of room without touching.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star did initially try to refuse the handkerchief. It being pressed firmly into her hand did force her to take it, though...She still didn't use it. She let her tears fall. They had slowed. But the odd sniffle and tear did still pass. She nodded lightly to Ellesandra, confused why the woman was so pained. Was it something she said? It must have been, but...She promised she wouldn't pry, and she would hold to that. The most she could do would assure Ellesandra she was present, that she was here for them, but she sincerely doubted Ellesandra had any major change of heart on the matter in the handful of minutes since Star had asserted that she wanted to know, but wouldn't press. So she moved to the bench, sitting next to but not touching Ellesandra. The bench looked over a clear pond of fresh water. Likely one of the main water sources for the grove. Star continued to not use the handkerchief. She instead just looked at it, brushing her thumb over the soft fabric. Obviously, the object didn't have any emotions for her to read, but her curiosity about it was clear. Despite that, she didn't ask about it or say a word about the clear mist she observed in the eyes of her companion, nor the strong emotions she observed in general. She was there if they wanted to talk but...She assumed they didn't. So she just spoke up about something else, as a way of reaffirming her promise to not force Ellesandra to speak about these things. "...Have you always trained with a rapier? Most knights I have met use longswords and shields. Not one to go with the popular choice, huh?" she put on a forced smile. She didn't even look at Ellesandra. Just kept looking at the embroidered cloth in her hands. The topic was random, of course. Just the first thing she could think to speak about that wasn't emotional. Something that let Ellesandra save face.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced over at Star, who appeared to just be examining the handkerchief. There was confusion as to why she wasn't using it; a frown crossing her face and looking up at Star's own face, before she shrugged it off and turned to look out over the lake. The question wasn't personal, at least on the surface. It was one Ellesandra thought she could answer, and still walk around the point that she didn't want to talk about. Her gaze ran along the water, silent for a few moments while planning out her response, not just speaking her mind immediately. Focusing on this task helped distract her, so even if Star hadn't intended it as a way to help, it was. "I did use spear and shield, for most of the time growing up. Eventually I dropped the shield as I became more talented with my magic; I needed a hand free to weave spells, but would keep the shield on my back for use between situations where I'd need it. I trained one of my charges with the rapier, though. She wanted to learn something that she could carry with her without it making her look...manly, she called it. Or improper. We talked about daggers that she could hide, but she wanted a weapon she could actually engage in sparring with, so we settled on a rapier." Ellesandra looked up at the clear sky, remembering that day with a wistful, sad smile. "I'm ambidextrous and she was left handed, so I taught her with my left hand so it was fairer for her to learn, easier for her to watch and emulate than if I used my right hand. In a later fight, I got wounded in my right arm pretty badly, and wasn't close to a healer to have them help repair it. Not to mention my particular, unique abilities make healing and restoration spells not as effective on me; a double edged sword, being particularly resistant to magic." The wistful smile had dropped from her face and she looked down to the lake, sighing. "I can use my right arm fine, but if I were to try to use it in a real fight, against anyone who had any strength or skill, it would be a liability. It doesn't do well with anything strenuous or heavy. So I picked up the rapier for myself in my left hand and use my right hand for my spells."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Had Star intended for it to be therapeutic? No real tell gave it away in her demeanour, but given how in tune she was with emotion, it would hardly be surprising if it was the truth. Being able to know just what to say to people seemed to be a somewhat consistent talent of hers, from what evidence had been shown in their time together thus far. She wore a more genuine smile as the explanation passed. "Resistant to magic? Must just be the arcane sort. I've felt no resistance to mine, though...Mine is rather unique, so I can't say it's too surprising. We'll have to see how well I can heal those wounds on your legs. It'll be important to know how effective my healing will be on you." She spoke forward, looking out at the water for a time, then back at the handkerchief. She smiled after a few moments of silence, presumably from something running around in her own mind. "I can only imagine the sight of you training someone. Or even a class of people. You have a...Presence about you. A conviction in your words that I think makes it easy for people to trust that you're being sincere." She seemed to be mostly thinking aloud with these words, as a question then followed: "Did you want to be a knight? You don't have to answer if it's too personal of course. I'm just...Curious about what small Ellesandra was like, and what eventually had you turning to a life of wandering. I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that somewhere in that life story are things that we aren't gonna talk about so...If it helps, leave whatever blanks are necessary. Unless you'd rather just not answer."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged at the resistant comment. The only spell, per say, that Star had cast that effected her was one that she hadn't needed anyways, and her absorption of it had been similar to the intended effect as it was. Star's more passive abilities, to see her emotions and share them via touch, weren't entirely the same. At least, that's why Ellesandra assumed they weren't the same thing; she certainly wasn't a magical scholar. The thought of her training a class of people made her shake her head, though. "A class of students would drive me crazy." Ellesandra liked structure, and too many students didn't. She wouldn't last for a week as a teacher to more than just one or two where she could tolerate and be patient with the sudden changes. "As for being a knight, it depends on the timeframe. I -" There was a pause, a mixture of relief, gratitude, and that grief rising back up to the surface again. "I was an orphan, so being a knight wasn't something I ever really considered, for a long time. When I was taken in, I wanted to help the family that did so. Being a knight just...lined up with how I could do that, and what I was good at." She shrugged, not moving on to how she turned to a life of wandering. That bit alone had already gotten closer to the mountain than Ellesandra was truly comfortable with, as evident by her left hand turning into a fist on her own thigh and her eyes turning away from Star. She didn't know why she fought so hard to prevent Star from seeing her tear up; Star could SEE the emotion, but it didn't matter. And like always, Ellesandra didn't let the grief or sorrow overwhelm and take hold of her. It was pushed back down. "Do what you're good at, right? That's how you make a life in the world. Find something you're good at and don't hate, and get people to pay you to do it."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
It was natural for Star to look at others, even if not just for the politeness of giving someone one's attention while they spoke. She didn't stare at them, didn't study them like she often did, however. She was trying to give Ellesandra a little space in that regard, though that she could see the strong force of guilt and sorrow that welled in them. She was tempted to reach out and comfort them by placing a hand on their shoulder, but...She had perceived in them that they didn't like her touch quite so much, given the effects that carried with it. It hurt. It hurt to know that something she relied on, something she wanted to do, to offer physical comfort, was unwanted. But she kept that hurt down, and managed to mask it in a way that wasn't typical for her. Ellesandra didn't have the same advantage as her, of course. It wasn't that she couldn't understand the hesitation. The desire to retain privacy. And it didn't matter that Star had the absolute best, brightest, most pure intentions. If Ellesandra didn't want to accept her desire to be closer, she had no choice but to respect that. And she would, even if she struggled to see someone in pain and not do anything about it. The thought of it, let alone actually doing it, tore her heart to shreds. So it was, her genuine smile that she had been wearing faded as she nodded to Ellesandra's words. A little more forced. A little more of a mask. For someone as expressive as Star, it wasn't hard to tell the difference. Others might not be able to see her emotions clearly, but she certainly didn't make it terribly challenging to read her like a book most of the time. She was trying to put on a smile for the knight, even if her heart felt like it was in a vice. "You're certainly good at helping people," she said, her voice a bit quieter now. She'd stopped crying and sniffling. Now it was just a...Looming cloud over her. A sorrow that clung to her and had not yet healed. "I'm sorry you had such suffering in your early years. I do hope you were brought in early in life...And that those who did take you in were loving and kind to you." Words, sincere as could be, spoken from a woman who, at some unknown young age, had been forced to fend for herself, based on the story she told.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shrugged, latching onto the comment about suffering in early years. Thinking about that was easier than thinking about why she became a wandering knight, about everything surrounding it. "Nothing to be sorry for. I don't remember any of it. I think I was found when I was three? Four? They don't quite know how old I was, exactly, but too young to remember much from before that. As such, the day they found me was assigned as the anniversary of my birth, for future celebrations and such." A brief smile creased her face, thinking about a few of those, before she shook her head. "And they were more than kind to me." Up until the end, but Ellesandra didn't say that part. Taking a deep breath, she shook her head. "Why is it that you can pull emotions out of me that I haven't let myself experience in three years?" Three years, since it happened. She eyed Star a little suspiciously, as if somehow her magic was at fault for allowing her to just reach in and pluck them out. Straight past all of her guards and barriers. It was unfair, and that was just one of the reasons she wasn't comfortable with Star touching her. Considering that Star had no intention of using the handkerchief, as made obvious by her still just holding it, Ellesandra reached over for it again. She had no intention of offering it once more, with Star's refusal to put it to use. "I think we've been emotional enough for the day. What's next on the agenda, Miss-...Star?" This was Ellesandra trying her best to be polite in saying she wanted, no, needed the topic to change if they were going to talk. And move onto something lighter, something not herself preferably.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star smiled, genuinely again, hearing that those who took Ellesandra in were kind to her. Good parents. Yes. That was good. That was comforting, though some strange emotion flashed in Ellesandra with those words that Star couldn't place. Still...She didn't pry. She offered the handkerchief back when the knight reached for it. She smiled again at the perhaps rhetorical question. "...Emotion is what has defined my life. The connections that we form, one person to another. The best and worst things that come with being human. It's...Far easier to explore emotion, and far easier to speak about things you might not otherwise do, when you know the person you are with sincerely cares about it all." She looked at Ellesandra and flashed another smile, then looked back out at the water. "The longer you stay around me, the more I'm sure you'll get used to seeing me be emotional. I...Admit I can get worked up over small things at times. I'm still not perfect at controlling my own emotions, after all," she said with a quiet giggle. "I don't have anything in mind, Ellesandra. We're resting on your insistence, after all. So I'm content to just...Enjoy the sights. Be with you, and be calm for now. I admit I've been thinking about the state of affairs in Cloverport. Wondering if there was maybe some way that we could have returned peace to that place. But before you go chiding me...I know there are things even I can't hope to achieve on my own. And after the stunt we pulled I don't see any diplomatic options for getting rid of the pirates. I can only hope that that works itself out, somehow, I suppose."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't know how to respond to the idea of Star sincerely caring about her, and how she was feeling. It made her a little uncomfortable in that she wasn't sure she wanted someone to get close like that, to actually care for her and poke at things she'd rather leave buried. It seemed Star had agreed not to poke, though, so that was good. "Worked up over small things, like blueberries?" There was a wry tone of amusement in Ellesandra's words and emotions, remembering how Star had teared up and cried a little when Ellesandra had shared her blueberries with her. There wasn't judgment, though. It had been confusion and concern, and now amusement, at how easily Star had teared up over the blueberries. There was no judgment or demeaning attitude towards the fact that Star had shown emotions that easily, though. She spread open the handkerchief in front of her, fingers tracing the embroidered letters, M.K. "I'm not sure what we could have done for the citizens of Cloverport. Honestly, we likely made things worse. That, or they will think we will bring reinforcements and they'll leave. We can hope for that option, but the more likely thing is that they find the dead pirates, both that escorted their supposed elven captive as well as the ones out on the road that attacked you, and they'll take it out on the citizens." She flipped the handkerchief over, idly playing with the thread on it, before lightly folding it up into a neat little triangle. "We could go back and try to do something stealthily, but our options there are limited. Cutting off the head of their group would only bring another captain in their place, and maybe lash out at the village. Burn a ship, that makes it even less likely they leave and they might burn the town. People like that tend to give as good as they get. If you want to help them, then I'd suggest we just share the news of what happened and request the aid of those with enough soldiers to stamp them out in one blow. That way, we don't even have to stop our journey, either." The handkerchief was placed back in her pocket. Out of sight, out of mind; but always carried.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star blushed, but smiled at the mention of blueberries. She giggled. "...Nobody ever really paid much attention to that. And I...What can I say? I appreciate small gestures. You can tell a lot about someone by little thoughtful acts like that," she said, smiling back at the knight while idly kicking her legs. She then listened to the knight speak about the other options, and she paused for a moment, then looked around them. She was getting an idea. Perhaps a dangerous prospect, given her track record. "...I think you're right," she said, looking back at Ellesandra. "I think the elves here will want to know what those pirates did to one of their own. And I think it might be prudent to suggest that they oust those pirates by force, and establish better ties with the governing force in Cloverport. The two settlements are close enough, and the other city being a port means there'd be a lot of opportunity for trade," she said, smiling. "We should see if we can find someone of some authority. Perhaps Morrun would know where to direct us?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star with an eyebrow raised. "You...are a meddler, aren't you?" Like her previous comment about the blueberries, there was no judgment or indication that this was a negative thing. Instead, she was just amused by it, though she did note that this would likely mean a harder job for her in the future, what with making sure Star was safe and all. Sighing, she moved to stand, nodding to what Star was saying. "Then yes, Morrun did offer to introduce us to the leader already didn't he? We can set up a meeting if possible and go from there." She took a moment, stretching her arms up, and then leaning her torso back with her hands on the back of her hips. Stretches in each direction before she cracked her neck and turned back to Star. Her emotions from earlier had all been put back in their spot, feeling much more like herself - well, her current self. She did eye Star's still blotchy face from the sobbing, but didn't comment on it. If Morrun had something to say about it, she would follow Star's lead on it. Star didn't seem the type to hide why she'd cried, but Ellesandra wouldn't volunteer that information if Star didn't first.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star wore a proud, cheery, playful smile upon being called a meddler. A badge of honour, it seemed, rather than something to be ashamed about. "Only where there is evil to be meddled with," she said with a more selfsame chipper, singsong-y cadence to her voice. She rubbed at her eyes, but didn't seem to be too worried about anyone commenting on it. Or if she was, she didn't show it. Off they went, back to Morrun's place. It was growing a bit later in the day. Sunset would be upon them in an hour or two. When they arrived, Lissana showed a bit of concern upon seeing Star. "Oh, Star, Ellesandra. Is everything all right?" asked the elven woman. Star nodded. "Of course, all is well. Just an emotional chat brought on by discussing our next steps," replied Star. Honest, as ever. That seemed to be enough to satisfy the question. Morrun was at the dining table, halfway through eating a muffin. He swallowed and nodded to the two entering. Star began by holding out a hand. The coin pouch that Ellesandra had given her, the one they definitely took their pay out of, appeared in her hand with a subtle glow of light that rose from her palm. As she had said, it was her intent to return it to Morrun, unless Ellesandra stopped her.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along, walking just a pace behind Star and to the side, like most bodyguards would. A single diagonal step needed to cover Star, but giving enough personal distance that Star wouldn't feel crowded - or Ellesandra crowded by Star - and give the illusion to Star, if she wished for it, to forget that Ellesandra was there. When they arrived back to Morrun's place, Lissana's concern wasn't unsurprising. Ellesandra looked much better than Star of course, since she'd only teared up and hadn't let herself actually let go and cry. As they entered and Star went straight to returning the money to Morrun, Ellesandra just gave Morrun a sheepish smile. "Should have waited until we left to give it to her, hmm?" She commented, a minor scold to herself but not actually upset at the turn of events. She'd expected it as soon as Star had mentioned it, though there was a curious gaze given to Star's sleeve. Was there some sort of magical storage in there somewhere? She hadn't seen or felt the bag of coins the entire time they were at the meadows. Still, Ellesandra made no move to stop the return of the coin which she had definitely taken her pay out of. Crossing her arms, she moved to stand by the door to the kitchen, taking up a standard guards spot. This may be Morrun's house and there not be anything to guard against, but it was a comfort thing. She was used to finding a spot where she could see the exits and be close to her charge; not doing so was a sign of Ellesandra truly relaxing, and a level of trust that not even Star had fully earned yet.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun gave Ellesandra a chiding look. A look that said wordlessly that she went and screwed it up, all done with a smile on his lips. "We took our pay out of it, so you can keep the rest," said Star as she set the coins down for the elven man. The heavy thud the bag made had him instinctively knitting his brow. He went to inspect the bag, estimating the coins. He didn't seem pleased. "...What, did each of you take like, two coins?" sighed Morrun. "Honestly. I can't accept this," he said, looking at Star and Ellesandra. "You two barely took anything, as much is obvious," he continued, which now invited Lissana to share in the disapproving stares, threatening as a squirrel with her frown and cute pink apron. Star paused. "...Well, I took five coins. Fifty gold can be made to last a long while. So..." She then turned, slowly, to look at Ellesandra. "...How many did you take, then, Ellesandra?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh, Ellesandra had just fallen into a trap, hadn't she? The slow turn and look from Star made Ellesandra grit her teeth, narrowing her eyes at the mage. Had she planned this? She'd said she could tell when people lied - even implied that she knew Ellesandra hadn't really taken her pay out of the bag earlier. But to set her up for that right in front of Morrun and Lissana was just - well, devious. Ellesandra crossed her arms and held a stoic, nonplussed look on her face as she met Star's gaze. "I paid for my room at the Inn last night, and took ten platinum. And then I decided I would donate ten platinum back to our group fund for our journey, since we'll be sharing time together on the road and supplies and such, anyways." It was a total lie, and ended up to her only taking enough to pay for her room anyways. The thing is, Ellesandra knew Star could tell. And she was meeting Star's gaze in a challenge, the amusement at the situation rising. She wondered how far fetched she could get with her explanations before Star would call her on it in front of people; would she do so now, or would she let it slide? There was a little bit of humor showing, and an interest to see how much she could push Star before she was just straight up called on her bullshit.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Oh, that's a wonderful explanation, if I was a five year old that didn't understand how math works," said Star back with a similar amusement on her voice and posture. "Well in that case, I should explain that I took all of the money, but then donated it to you so you could donate it back to me so I could donate it back to Morrun. If you follow that logic, I think that means both of us got paid twice. Really, Morrun, you have no business being so generous to both of us," she said, briefly turning to the elven man for effect. No, it seemed Star had zero qualms in calling out the lie right then and there. She sighed. She could recognize that she hadn't taken all the money herself either. "Honestly. When we were first walking to Cloverport you talked about me hiring you. If I knew hiring your services cost a grand total of what...One gold per day, I could have hired you for a few months on that salary without issue. But I think we can all agree a knight's escort is worth at least a little more than that, can't we?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star took the excuse further and it got an honest, surprised laugh out of Ellesandra. She tilted her head back out belted out an amused chuckle, one she hadn't really made in so long she herself was surprised that it had come out. She cleared her throat, taking on the stoic look again, but this time looking to Morrun. "Did you hear that? You're quite generous, paying us twice." And then she looked back to Star. She tightened her arms around her own chest in her crossed arms position, shaking her head at her. "I'm sorry, you seem to be under the impression that the client gets to decide what the cost of my services is. No, my services are valued by myself. And I will sell my services for what I think is appropriate, which may change from one job to another." Her eyebrows raised, challenging Star to disagree. "Or do you not think that I am fully capable of recognizing the worth of my work? And what is appropriate to charge? I have been doing this job for three years, after all, and even longer beforehand in a longterm contract. I like to think I know what I'm worth." She knew she was lowkey arguing that her worth was less than Star was implying, but she also knew that it was up to her to charge what she wanted, not up to Star to decide what she should be paid. And she'd draw that boundary clearly. "If you can't afford me, well. Then I guess that's your loss." She said, feeling amusement at the mock bickering they had right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Morrun and Lissana exchanged glances. The more these two observed Star and Ellesandra, the less they understood them. Not sleeping in the same bed, not even the same house, but... "They argue just like we do, dear," said Morrun to his wife, evoking a giggle. Star seemed to miss this comment as she fired back at Ellesandra. "Yeah? Well it might just be the clearest evidence I have no business being a pirate, because I sure do know when I'm stealing something!" she said, hands on her hips and a smile on her face as she leaned slightly towards the knight. "So be honest then, gallant knight! Let's negotiate a price, right here, right now! I anticipate the journey I'm undertaking will take upwards of a year. So I'm sure within that time frame I will have secured enough gold to purchase your services for a year thereafter at an agreed-upon price. So this is my formal proposition to hire you for a full year. Go on, name your price!" As she said this, she swiped the bag of platinum from the table again, ready to use this as a chance to back Ellesandra into a corner on the bargaining table. There was quite a lot of gold in the coinage of platinum for her to work with, and how she was planning to out-fox the knight wasn't quite clear, but it was their move.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced at Morrun curiously at his comment, not quite sure what he was implying there. Her and Star certainly weren't a couple, so it couldn't be that. Shrugging, she looked back at Star and her smile, as well as the challenge she was giving her. Ellesandra didn't name her price, not at first. At first, her eyes scanned Star up and down, trying to determine how serious she was about this. She didn't want Star to feel like she was making her out to be a thief, even though that would be wholly inaccurate and completely within Ellesandra's rights to offer her services for free. Leaning back against the wall, she raised an eyebrow at the woman, then looked to the bag. "Oh, I don't know. I'm thinking for a full year of my service, paid upfront, would be about....440 gold." That would be what was left in there, if Star really took 5 platinum and Ellesandra had taken 1 platinum to pay for her Inn room with. The exact amount, if Ellesandra's calculations were correct. "Considering you are getting the services of a trained Knight, that equals to just over 1 gold a day, doesn't it?" Math was not Ellesandra's specialty and she didn't even try to pretend to do the actual calculation for what it was worth. "If you would rather, you can pay half up front and keep the other half with you in case you need it on your journey. When you earn more you can pay it at the end of the journey." Okay, now Ellesandra was just being snobby, teasing Star into considering keeping the bag of coin herself.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star's reaction was instant. The moment Ellesandra said 440 gold, Star placed the entire bag into Ellesandra's hands, by first gently grabbing their wrist if necessary. There was still the nine gold in change Ellesandra had received that was also in the bag, but Star felt the dramatic act would be subdued if she fished around to grab those coins first. "There. Consider yourself hired, then," she said, arms folded. And through it all, Morrun was just chuckling to himself at the absurdity of this whole ordeal. The gold was right back where it started when he handed it to Ellesandra.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had expected something of that sort, taking the bag and bouncing it in her hand once, as if gauging how much was it in. She even put on the act of opening it and pilfering few some of the coins to better estimate and ensure that they were all platinum, like someone seeing a bag of coin for the first time. "Ah, lovely, perfect, thank you Miss Lumina." A grin was flashed towards Star. "Now, as someone who is invested in this journey we're on, I would like to donate to our group fund, so to speak. This can be used to purchase supplies, buy nights of lodging and pay for any travel costs during our year. Typically this would be entirely at the expense of the client, but again - I am particularly partial to completing this mission and wish to help." She then hefted the bag, weighing it again as if considering how much was in it and how much to give. "So...yes, I think this would do it." Stepping forward, she would take Star's wrist and turn it over, facing up. Her guards were up, expecting the touch, but it was only brief enough to place the bag of coins in Star's upturned palm. "Yes, I think that will do." If Star still resisted, she would just take the bag of coin and set it atop Star's head, before turning to Morrun. "So, we did come here for a purpose, Sir. I believe Star here wished to seek an audience with the leader of this settlement? Something about convincing him to help the town of Cloverport out, set up an allying agreement or something or another. I'm sure my client is better with words than I am, she is the meddler after all." Ellesandra was sporting a smirk the entire time she spoke.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was immediately ready to counter what she saw coming. Back to this talk of donating, as soon as it came, had Star pouting and putting her hands behind her back, folded over the small of her back and out of reach. The grin she wore said she felt she outfoxed her knightly opponent. But then they just put it on her head. "Wh-- Hey!" she said, doing a good job of balancing the coins on her head. Ellesandra then moving on without giving her a chance to counter seemed to seal the matter. She grumbled, taking the coins off her head as she leered at Ellesandra. Morrun quirked a brow at the knight. "Oh, did you? Here I thought you just saw fit to regale my wife and I in impromptu theatre," he said with a cheeky grin on his face. Lissana had a sweet look on her face while leaning against the wall that connected the dining area and the kitchen. Star, still clearly pouty about being bested at her own game, took a more serious tone when talking to Morrun. "...Yes. The nearby city of Cloverport is overrun with pirates. I mean, obviously. You know that as well as I do. It was my thinking that passing on the news of what happened to you to those in charge of this settlement will be the best course of action. First, because if they have done this once, they are sure to do it again. And as beautiful as this place is, Ellesandra and I aren't long to stay. So a return here after I have achieved my goal to see you both again aside, we won't be here to save any other innocent people here who might be targeted. As necessary as it was to do what we did, it's likely that whether we paid or attacked, the pirates would have felt either emboldened to get away with it again, or in this case, out for revenge. And the people here should not need to feel like they are being hunted. So, much as I detest violence...It's my suggestion that your settlement's hunters take action. Perhaps in a joint effort with the local militia of Cloverport. If the pirate influence is removed, then there will be safe passage, trade, and all the benefits of local cooperation." Star smiled. Morrun considered the words. "Well. You certainly make a diplomatic case for it, Star. But the decision's not up to me on that. I'd also rather not force Lissana to relive any of it, so I'd best speak on her behalf." He paused to smile at his wife, assuring them that he would handle things. Lissana had a small nervousness, a tremor in her figure that spoke of the trauma she would eventually have to deal with. Star clearly noticed, for she was giving Lissana that familiar stare, and it brought sorrow to Star's face. Morrun stood, moving over to the other two after giving his wife a kiss. "I'll see about getting you an audience."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She felt a pride and satisfaction fill her when Star pouted and seemed to relent about the coin. Oh, it was entirely possible that Star snuck the coin back somehow later, or just used it to purchase something for Ellesandra or something like that, but really what could she do about that? No, the gold had been given to Star, and it was hers to do with now. The theatre comment caused more amusement as she glanced at Lissana, then back to Morrun as he spoke with Star. Her mood quickly shifted to one of concern when Lissana was brought back up, and the trauma that happened to her. Ellesandra only glanced at her once before looking back to Morrun, not wanting her to feel like she was being stared or watched, or pitied by everyone in the room. At Morrun's confirmation about getting them an audience, she once more spoke up while looking to Star. "Well, while you do that, I believe by how dark it is beginning to get it should be time for some dinner. Lissana, would you like any help in the kitchen?" Ellesandra was not a great cook by any means, but she knew how to do the basic things at least. You didn't live alone travelling along the road without learning how to do camp cooking, and it could only be easier when doing it in an actual kitchen, right? Not to mention, the entire point of the offer was to get Lissana's mind off of the trauma she'd just been reminded of and give her the option of company, if she'd like it.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star and Morrun looked at each briefly. Star smiled. "I'm famished," she said aloud in encouragement to Ellesandra. But there was something subtle to it. It was intentional. Star wasn't one to impose on others, so for her to make such a comment could only be to reinforce a sense of purpose in Lissana, who brightened at the thought of Ellesandra helping, and having something to focus on. "O-Oh, uhm, if you don't mind, Miss Ellesandra," she said, her more meek side appearing as the emotions took hold of her. Lissana had a bright side to her, but she seemed quite susceptible to the fear and discomfort of the memories. She still had fading red marks on her wrists and lips, as well as ankles, which weren't visible before given the woman was wearing long pants, but with her airy summer dress they certainly were. Manacles on wrists and ankles left their marks. "We'll leave dinner to you both then. Be back soon, my love," said Morrun, then existed with Star. Curiously, the coin bag was gone again, nowhere on Star's person. Where had it gone this time? She didn't have sleeves on her dress to slide it up, nor pockets to hide it in. But this wouldn't be something one could focus on long, for the two were out the door soon after.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There had been a brief pang of regret when she'd realized Star was going off to the meeting. Ellesandra had thought Morrun was off to set up a meeting, not that the meeting was happening now. Not that Ellesandra cared at all about the meeting itself, but just a matter of not being there in case the leader responded poorly for some reason. She glanced back, watching Star exit and silently hoping she hadn't just put Star in danger by trying to get Lissana's mind off of things. She didn't dwell on it for long, though, before turning to follow Lissana into the kitchen, not having even noticed the disappearance of the coin bag. "No Miss necessary, just Ellesandra is fine." She said, responding to Lissana a bit belatedly. She was being gentle, and would stand to the side, waiting for Lissana to guide her. This wasn't her kitchen, nor did she know what they were going to be making, so she stood at the ready. "What can I help with? I certainly don't want to get in your way with my help, so feel free to tell me where to go and what to do." Someone who had been chained up being able to tell others what to do, not just be told what to do, would be helpful right? Ellesandra wasn't sure how to approach this, but she was going off of gut feeling right now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Lissana gave a sheepish nod. She didn't wish to address a knight improperly, less so one that was dually responsible for saving her life. Lissana didn't know what Ellesandra was familiar with doing in the kitchen, but she did assume the others would be out for an hour or more. The notion that they were hungry had Lissana eager to make a bigger meal, so she invited Ellesandra down into the basement of the home. Therein, a cold storage room was set up with small blue mana crystals that kept the room icy cold. Frozen meats kept in storage was something of a higher class amenity, but if nothing else it did suggest that the two of them were capable of parting with five hundred gold somewhat painlessly. It was a lot, but they clearly weren't lacking. They were comfortable. A whole chicken was going to be used as part of it, which Lissana had Ellesandra carry while she grabbed some vegetables, spices, and herbs from her pantry. A couple more things were added to the knight's hold, though Lissana would have to grab it; she shelving was built with elves in mind. And elves were regularly well above six feet tall, so the knight would find much of the higher shelves out of reach without some assistance. All said and done, the two moved back up and Lissana got to focusing on dolling out the tasks. If Ellesandra was familiar with how to butcher a chicken, that would be their job once the plucked chicken carcass had been out long enough to thaw, which curiously only took about ten minutes. Curious magic at work, but quite the convenience. Most of the work was done on a cutting board with the veggies, which were being used both to add substance to the meal as well as to cook with the chicken to impart their flavours. The chicken needed to be sectioned into quarters, and Lissana described the ultimate goal as an aromatic dish that used spice and earthy vegetables on top of an herby rub on the chicken to give it all a wonderful flavour. Potatoes would round out the plate of chicken and veg, with a wholesome chicken-shallot gravy for the whole or part of the meal. An anecdote was thrown in: apparently Morrun liked gravy on everything, jokingly explained as the man bathing his food in it. He had seemed a bit generous with the syrup at breakfast, so it was not a major surprise. But of course, the way Lissana spoke of her husband would come as no surprise in how loving it was. How after however long they were married, she still was as in love with him now as the day they met. But with the focus on the task, Lissana wouldn't stray too far from small talk unless Ellesandra had specific questions.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a good worker. She followed along with Lissana and helped her carry things, doing what she asked. A strange glance was given to the small blue mana crystals, but she didn't comment on them. Her eyes stared up at the tall cabinets far above her head, and was glad that Lissana was getting things out of them instead of her. Once back up in the kitchen, she followed Lissana's instructions. The small talk was all she needed or offered, since unlike Star she had no idea how to help ease the tension that Lissana was probably feeling in regards to the recent trauma she'd had. Ellesandra had offered her company and something to do to distract the elf, and that was about all she knew to offer in a situation like this. The food sounded delicious, and smelled delicious as she was helping prepare it. She was happy to handle the chicken and prepare it, and then begin slicing and chopping vegetables and such, but she left most of the actual cooking to Lissana. Ellesandra knew just enough not to burn the house down and to be able to survive on her own; she wasn't about to step in on Lissana and mess anything up. As Lissana began talking more and more about Morrun, Ellesandra found that would probably be a relatively safe topic to delve into. Asking how they met, who proposed to who and how that went, and all those typical questions she'd learned the kitchen and serving staff would gossip about growing up. Ellesandra had never really partaken in said gossip and girlish questions, but it didn't mean she hadn't been around enough to listen in and hear the types of things that were asked. Beyond that, Ellesandra was quiet and let Lissana talk, or let a comfortable silence build between them.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The story that Lissana had to tell on the matter was a simple but cute one. Morrun was a planar scholar, Lissana a teacher of the Seldarine teachings. The inn bore the same name in part - 'Seldarine'. She went on to explain it was the elvish pantheon, though she didn't get into technical details. But it had sparked a connection, with the two meeting in a library and discussing a place known as the Feywild for so long that the library had to inform the two of them mid-conversation that they were closing for the day, and on that night the two walked among the stars and simply explored the connection they felt. It led to a swift romance borne of a shared scholarly interest, and of course helped by the fact that the two found one another so very beautiful. Morrun proposed to Lissana quite quickly by elvish standards - it was only twenty years later! Which, if that brought with it any confusion would lead to Lissana speaking to how Morrun was two-hundred and seven years old, and Lissana was one-hundred and eighty five. Still quite young, by elvish timelines. Lissana then took a break from cooking while there was less to do and jaunted up the stairs to come back down with an oil painting that had been made of them on their wedding day, showing Morrun in a stylish dark-green set of his finest clothes, with Lissana in a brilliant emerald-green dress. The painting was well done. Not a masterwork, but a competent painter certainly was wielding the brush. Of course, it would have taken more than a day to create such a thing, so the two likely dressed up more than a few times to get this done. A beautiful memento, all the same. She returned it to their bedroom once she had shown it off thoroughly, then returned to finish cooking. Between the story and the cooking, it did seem to have Lissana in higher spirits. A bandage for the pain for the day, even if it was still going to be a long road ahead for Lissana. Nightmares were sure to come, but that Lissana was saved allowed them to take on a semblance of normalcy that would certainly see them healing in time. They had safety and a loving husband. They would be okay. Time passed, and while the food cooked, Lissana saw fit to prepare a dessert as well. A pie, she settled on, but there was some indecision about what filling to use. She would take Ellesandra's input if they had any, but if not she would make an apple pie for no particular reason other than having a bit of a surplus of apples. Morrun and Star were taking a bit longer than one might expect, but surely they would return soon.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was patient in listening to the story, offering a smile in the right spots and nods and attentively listening to the elven woman. The painting surprised her, eyes raising in surprise at the idea of them having gotten that painted and how much effort that must have taken. They certainly were well off then, between the mana crystals and being able to afford such a painting. Eventually, Ellesandra had just stopped working, letting Lissana take over the activities and more just keeping her company in the kitchen, in order to prevent them from running out of things to do to keep Lissana busy. When the topic of pie was brought up and the option of what to use for it, Ellesandra recommended blueberries if they had any left from breakfast. She didn't elaborate on why, though Lissana had been at breakfast that morning and had clearly seen Star get teary eyed about the knight sharing her blueberries. She'd glanced out the window occasionally, as time passed getting a little worried that something might have gone wrong with this meeting. Surely if it had been a quick meeting they would have been back by now, right? Then again, it was entirely possible they just had to wait for a while to be able to even meet with the leader of the camp, if the person was busy with other things. Or even Star being her meddlesome self and actively helping plan. A soft smile crossed her lips in amusement at the thought of Star bent over a war table with a map of Cloverport on it, pointing out where the ships were and everything else she remembered about the pirates. Maybe not actively suggesting battle tactics - that didn't seem up Star's alley - but providing as much information as possible definitely did. Moving to lean back against the wall again, she'd look towards Lissana and change the topic so it didn't get stale. "So Seldarine is an Elven deity? Is there anything I should know about them? I apologize, I'm not particularly versed in deities beyond those I grew up with. The land I grew up with mostly served Tyr, though I was particular to Torm in my youth. Knighthood and all, tended to be dedicated to loyalty and honor." Less personal, hopefully, but also a topic most people found uplifting. Ellesandra may have long lost her faith in deities being righteous or good as they might proclaim to be, but she knew that religion was important to a lot of people in time of hardship.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Hm? Oh, it's not a single deity. It's in reference to one of the two elvish pantheons. Without bridging into the entire history, Seldarine is elvish for 'fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood'. The Seldarine follow Corellon and his consort, Angharradh, among the other lesser deities below. There's much you could learn, but as for what you should know, it is simply that long, long, long ago, Corellon and Lolth were once lovers, but Lolth, called Araushnee at the time, allied herself with Gruumsh to try and kill Corellon. Araushnee was exiled by Corellon, where she took the name Lolth, and with a whole lifetime's worth of reading in the history being skipped, it is now that the Seldarine and Lolth-sworn oppose one another. You will find no drow among our ranks, even if there are some among the drow who do good." She then giggled. "You'll have to forgive me as I acknowledge that you are...Quite exactly the sort of follower of Torm that I envision. Protective, lawful, duty-bound, righteous...I shall have to offer him my thanks in prayer, and perhaps see if there is a temple in his name near us for me to make a donation to. He might certainly have had a hand in bringing you to me in my hour of need; even if he had not, he has guided you to become the sort of person who would do as you had." A smile was given. Of course, Lissana didn't know the particulars of whose idea it was, only that Ellesandra had played a major role in her salvation. She explained all this while working on the filling for what was to be a blueberry pie. If she had any inclination what the recommendation was for, she didn't say anything. But it was after this lecture that revealed Lissana to be quite the religious sort that Star and Morrun returned, walking into the home with calm smiles about them. Though Star had a look about her as she met eyes with Ellesandra. A look of slight nervousness. A look that suggested she might have news that Ellesandra might not like.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't commented on how she was the exact type of follow of Torm that Lissana would expect. She just silently nodded, knowing that if she disagreed about Torm having anything to do with her rescue it might sound insulting to someone who was so obviously strongly religious. She was also saved from having to find any other topics to discuss by the return of Star and Morrun. Ellesandra quickly looked Star up and down to ensure nothing had happened to her while she was away, the concern that she'd had quickly turning to relief, then confusion and concern again when she met eyes with Star. Then dread and acceptance. She sighed, running a hand through her hair before pulling it up into a ponytail again, just so it would be out of the way when it came to whatever she had just been volunteered to do, or for dinner. "I take it we're joining the return trip to Cloverport? Or is that look for some other reason?" She eyed Star, taking a wild guess at what that nervousness might be for. Star was a meddler, and she'd thought that maybe Star had just been helping plan. But maybe Star had actively volunteered their assistance; it was the most likely option, Ellesandra thought. Of course it was also possible that Star had somehow insulted the elven leader and they were being kicked out, but that seemed more like something she would do, not Star. A glance was given over to the food cooked, and then a polite nod offered to Morrun, before looking back to Star to wait for the news that she was probably not going to like.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"Oh, good. You already heard," said Star with a nervous smile that silently said 'don't kill me please'. "...Though technically it's only my own services that were required to convince the council. A compelling argument was made that I had no business requesting others risk their life if I was not willing to do the same; there was quite the disagreement between two of the council members, one stating that the elves were safe here and that the solution was for nobody to be leaving without escort, the other saying that it was cowardly to hide in this place waiting to be discovered...It grew a little heated for a moment," explained Star, though she kept a chipper tone. "All is well though. And as much as I can insist that you yourself aren't required to join along, Ellesandra, I know how futile that line of discussion is so...We move at dawn. For what it's worth though, I only am acting as a healer, behind any frontline we establish. The wounded will be brought back so I can help minimize injury or loss of life. I'm more of a liability in a full scale fight like this anyway. As you saw I can protect myself but...Not for a protracted fight." Morrun said nothing, just moved to his wife. Lissana looked initially concerned, but hearing that Star wouldn't be on the front did ease her worried looks a touch. "The plan is to make contact with the local lord. Then, in tandem with the local militia, the force ought to be so overwhelming as to force a retreat. And when the pirates run back to their ships to set sail, the coastal ballistae will sink them." A sound plan in theory...But it had yet to touch upon the matter of how the pirates got in in the first place, with such defenses at the ready. By chance, perhaps? Stealth? The jolly roger handn't been flown on any ships after all. But surely the port city had guardsman enough to fight back? There remained pieces that might not be known, and could either be nothing at all, or details that could turn a bloodless confrontation into choas in moments.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at the 'already heard' part. She hadn't, she had just guarded a meddler before. Star was way too similar to Marigold. It gave Ellesandra the exact exasperation she'd felt before, and that was both a pleasant thing to feel again as well as painful, remembering the last thing Marigold had meddled in and how that had turned out. She rubbed her face with her hand, exasperation and stress obvious even without Star's ability to see it, but what Star would be able to see - beneath everything - was an ounce of pride in her for not just backing down. "Fine, back lines is good. I'll accompany and guard to ensure that they don't flank you or send someone in as a spy but is actually injured or anything." Ellesandra's actual talents would be better on the front lines, but she was not leaving Star. And she was not bringing Star with her to the front lines, so rear guard it would be." A deep breath was taken, then she looked over to Lissana and Morrun. "Good thing we'll be filling up on food tonight. Should get plenty of rest before setting off tomorrow." Ellesandra hoped the attack and retaking of the city would be as easy as Star had just laid it out. She highly doubted it would, though. She didn't know how the pirates had taken the place over, but it was likely they had inside men. If the elves were contacting the local lord, it was very possible they could be walking into a trap. There wasn't exactly fear, in regards to this, but caution and concern for Star in this whole process. Damned pure hearted women not knowing when to refuse a risk. "Any other news that I should know in regards to your meeting tonight, or the new mission tomorrow?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star of course knew that Ellesandra didn't hear about the plans ahead of time. How could they? Only Star and Morrun knew; the rest of the hunters would convene through the night, go through their reverie, and be ready by dawn. Star and Ellesandra had the disadvantage of needing twice as much rest as everyone else in this settlement, so they would need to sleep sooner rather than later. Star nodded to the notion of Ellesandra staying on the backlines. There was a bit of relief in her own face. Not that she believed the pirates could best Ellesandra in battle, but she didn't want to invite the knight to injury either. She shook her head to the question of other news. "That's about it. We all agree the threat to the region is too great to ignore. I will simply need to meditate tonight before bed, so I will need time alone after, and after tending to your wounds." Of course Star wouldn't forget about that part. "My meditation will ensure I am in top shape for tomorrow, so you can rest easy tonight, Ellesandra. We'll meet here at dawn tomorrow, then join the rear guard at the gates." With all that squared away, if there was no other business, it became time to eat.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. "No need to heal me. I'll be fine, and I'd rather you be up to absolute full strength tomorrow if you're going to be healing those who are injured. My guess is you'll have a lot more work to be doing tomorrow than I will." If things went to plan, that was. Rear guard only saw action if things didn't go according to plan. Otherwise, she was probably going to be just a bell girl, running to and fro getting supplies and helping carry injured people in or something. She'd done that role before while in rear guard; it wasn't like she was just going to be standing around, but the difference between doing any small task Star would need of her versus actively healing injuries was pretty major. As it came time to food, Ellesandra would help Lissana bring it all out to the table, and then move to take the same seat she had before. A polite nod was given to Lissana in thanks for the food, overall, and she eyed the chicken with more interest than she had the pancakes and sausage this morning. She didn't just delve into it, though. She would wait and be polite, letting everyone else grab at their food first. She'd talked quite a bit with Lissana earlier, so unless she was directly spoken to she was quiet, letting her introversion recharge, but she was attentive to the conversation nonetheless, glancing back and forth during any small talk over dinner to follow who was talking and what they were saying. She seemed relatively at peace, still having some concern for Star but mostly just relaxed - probably some of the most relaxed Star had seen from Ellesandra yet.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"We'll be in combat tomorrow. I'm healing you tonight," said Star with a stern tone. That wasn't negotiable it seemed, and Star didn't seem keen on hearing otherwise. So unless Ellesandra was keen on squabbling some more in front of the married couple, dinner began and the relaxed atmosphere was pleasant. Star didn't seem interested much at all in the chicken. A small piece for her. Lissana took a leg, and Morrun a breast, leaving a good amount left for Ellesandra. Star seemed to prefer eating fruits and veggies. Not a strict vegetarian by any measure, but she clearly had her preference if these meals had been any indication. It also likely mattered whether there was a choice in the matter or not; living on the wilderness, small game and protein was a necessary food, so even if Star's diet had its preferences, necessity would always trump them in all likelihood. Small talk was all that amounted from the table. Lissana spoke of showing off the wedding portrait, and of course Star insisted on seeing it, so it was brought down again for Star to see after the meal. Plenty of food for all it seemed, leaving Ellesandra a solid half of the chicken to themselves. A good, filling meal; the elven herbs and spices gave the meal a subtle, earthy flavour that was wholesome and left one's gullet feeling pleasantly plump with a lingering, herby aftertaste that set them all up quite well for dessert. Lissana was no gourmet chef, but it was the sort of staple meal that would never get old on the palette. And as predicted, Morrun's plate was in some places more gravy than it was food. Hard to blame him, as the gravy added even more delight to an already pleasant dish. After some enjoyable small talk, Lissana and Morrun talking about how they met for Star, dessert came. Star gave a playful side-eye to her knightly companion, but it was with a warm smile. No tears this time, thankfully, but Star was clearly in heaven with the dessert. A fresh pie was a perfect finish to the evening. But before Ellesandra could walk away from it all, Star would be sure to get in their way and gesture into the guest room for a bit of privacy so she could heal them. Not that flashing a bit of thigh was all that risque, but better to not force the knight to stand in a position with Star on her knees in front of them for the married couple to joke about.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't fight the comment. She was afraid Star wouldn't understand how much energy it would take to heal her, but she also knew that it wasn't worth having an argument over right now. Instead she fully delved into the chicken. The only kind of meat she liked more than chicken had been salmon, though she had only had that once or twice, and could you really call fish, meat? Either way, she ate plenty, careful not to over eat so that she wouldn't be too tired tonight and thus in the morning, but more than enough to sate herself. Unlike Morrun, she used very little of the gravy, only enough to add a bit of a wetness to the meat and help swallow it down, letting the taste of the chicken itself be the main event on her plate. She also ignored the side eye she got from Star when it came to the dessert, and only ate a very small piece of it. This wasn't to save some for Star, and more that she normally wasn't one for super sweet foods. Savory and salty were her preferences, and pies tended not to be like that. So she ate enough to be polite, especially since she'd been the one to recommend blueberries, but that was about it. As the food was finished entirely and Star insisted again on healing her, she sighed and moved to stand up. "Yes, my lady." The teasing and mocking tone at how Star was ordering her was apparent. There was no malice behind it, just her poking fun at how Star had gone from being a polite companion who 'hired' Ellesandra to now ordering her to get healed. She would walk off towards the guest room, leaving the door open as she stepped in. Not wearing her armor or leggings, she had no real choice but to just drop her breeches down to her knees. She also didn't know what position would be best for Star to do this, so she lowered them to her knees and stood with her legs wide enough apart to prevent them from falling all the way down. Ellesandra wore basic white undergarments, absolutely nothing special and designed entirely for function, not for anything else. Her thighs looked relatively smooth, minus a stray hair here and there since she hadn't exactly been keeping up on keeping them smoothly shaven, and of course the bandages that were still wrapped around where the wound itself was on both thighs. It had fully scabbed over and was healing decently, though was obviously a bit red in irritation at her continued movements and how much weight she'd put on them the previous day while carrying Star.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star gave a playful smile at Ellesandra at the mocking tone. Their little jabs back and forth were in good fun, and the mystic woman clearly understood and was happy to play along. It allowed a more casual closeness between them, rather than a stiff one between hired hand and patron. Even if that was technically the case, the way Star treated it was anything but; she would be just as insistent on this even if she hadn't hired Ellesandra, and had no intentions now or ever to use that agreement against the knight. Star did have a bit of a blush as the knight dropped their pants. Rather unavoidable, but with them standing like this to allow Star at their wounds, it was a rather...Awkward position as Star got down on her knees and moved her hands to the knight's thighs. Gentle hands removed the bandages and examined the wounds. She smiled, seeing they were healing nicely. But she wasn't about to leave them as they were. Her fingers moved onto the wounds themselves, pressing the pads of her four primary fingers vaguely equidistant from one another across the length of the cuts. Then, a gentle flow of something that was...Magical, yes, but it did not feel the same as any other times others had healed Ellesandra. First there was a small tingle of magic, something that touched against the resistance Ellesandra had like a wave upon a wall of rocks. Then...A flowing sensation through that resistance. Not pierced, but...Bypassed all the same, as if whatever Star was doing didn't fit the same mold of what Ellesandra's innate resilience was accustomed to. It looked effortless to Star, but then again so did her radiant, rainbow armor. And both of them saw how that went. But after this sensation came the soothing. The pain melted away. The irritation ebbed. The skin glowed under her touch, and the wounds vanished in a blink. The rash, the scabs, were no more. Star looked at the results, then smiled and rose to her feet again, keeping eyes above the waist to allow the knight to get their modesty back. "There. Wasn't so bad, was it?" she said, warmly smiling. "And look, I'm not doubled over heaving. I promise...I'll be more than ready for whatever tomorrow brings. I won't be acting alone, so the burden of healing will be spread among the group of healers." Star certainly seemed to be fine moving on like nothing happened, but...There was no ignoring that whatever she did, nothing about it should have played out as it had with the way Ellesandra's resistances were. It defied explanation. Was Star just...Special like that? Or was something else going on? The wounds were healed, that was certain. But...How? Did Star just expend a mountain of energy to do it? She certainly didn't seem fatigued...But maybe she was hiding it, and waiting for Ellesandra to leave before doubling over in exhaustion?

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She felt the awkwardness, and turned her gaze up so that she wasn't looking down at Star while she was doing her work at all. Her muscled thighs tensed and flexed at the feel of Star's hands on them, even just removing the bandages, and when she felt Star begin to use magic, Ellesandra had actively prepared herself to allow magic in. Naturally, magic seemed to roll off of her if it was directly targeted at her. Generic, area spells didn't exactly roll off of her, but tended to have less severe of an effect. Healing magic was a direct target, and between the magic usually rolling off and Ellesandra's body also wanting to naturally absorb the mana and energy within the spell, she had to actively focus on NOT doing that. She couldn't stop her natural resistance, but she could stop her body from trying to just suck in the mana. It was an important skill she'd learned when she'd first discovered her abilities, found after absorbing too much magic unintentionally and causing a severe mana sickness in herself. The healing didn't go as she expected. Oh, she still had to prevent herself from drawing in some of Star's mana and energy with the healing, but her natural resistance seemed to just...not exist. She looked down, over her shoulder at where the wounds were when Star stood up, frowning at how simple it had been. Star didn't LOOK fatigued or as if she had tried to just power through a strong barrier. The confusion was evident, even as Ellesandra reached down and pulled her breeches back up, re tightening them around her waist. Her eyes never left Star with a frown on her face, turning to her and crossing her arms. "Either you're hiding how much energy you just put into that or there is something you're not telling me, Star." Neither option was good, honestly. The former was bad for her role tomorrow, the latter was bad for her knowing what to expect. "I have never been healed as easily as that, not without a healer expending an enormous amount of energy to do so. I have scars all over my arms and torso for that reason. Why were you different just now?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
There was a knowing look on Star's face. There was no doubt she knew that this was wrong somehow for the knight. But for a moment she collected her thoughts, considering how she might make this out such that Ellesandra didn't chide her. Or chide her...As much. Star folded her hands behind her back, looking somewhat like a kid with their hand caught in the cookie jar. "Well. I know regular healing spells, of course. But I felt the resistance on you, and that wouldn't have worked very well. Much as you might not believe me, I do think about how to properly expend my mana so that I can do all that I need to do, as well. I know I'll need my reserves for tomorrow. So brute forcing past your resistance wasn't a smart idea. So instead I used..." She paused, pursing her lips. "...Another method. Something unique to me. My mother called it 'sympathetic healing'. It'll probably be how I have to heal you each time I do. But look!" she said, throwing her arms up in the air with a smile. "I'm fine! No need to fuss!" Her reaction was a little...Forcibly chipper. Trying to keep Ellesandra from asking too many more questions, perhaps? After all, Star did swear not to lie to them, so it was likely if there was more to it, any further questioning would ensure Star spill the beans so as to not be lying by omission. Still. The hope was there that her given, surface explanation was enough. It probably wouldn't be. But she could hope.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was suspicious. Star seemed to be too chipper about healing her. Her lips pressed into a thin line and her eyes narrowed, watching Star for a moment. There was definitely something going on there, but Star was obviously avoiding talking about it. She looked her up and down once, checking to see any signs of fatigue as if she had, indeed, brute forced the healing. Seeing nothing, she grumbled. "Well, isn't that convenient?" She muttered to herself. Finding the one person who could apparently heal her without any injuries and being hired by her. Shaking her head, she turned to head for the door. "Get some rest then, Star. Whatever it is you did, I'm sure you need to recover from it." It sounded like an order, though Ellesandra wasn't exactly going to be around for it. She looked back over her shoulder at Star, eyeing her up and down again. The suspicion was there; she knew Star was hiding something, she just didn't know what it was. And like the night before, she was not going to be sleeping here with her but at the Inn. "Do you need anything before I go?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked a little surprised that Ellesandra left it at that. But it was fine. She smiled, and shook her head. "I'm quite all right. I'll be in meditation for a while, so please pass on my goodnights to Morrun and Lissana and ask them to keep the door closed, as I will need peace for it. It will ensure I am, as promised, in tip top shape for tomorrow. We'll see peace brought back to this region by sundown, Ellesandra." She smiled again. "Sleep well. I'll see you at dawn." And if that was that, she saw fit to set up on the bed and begin her meditation, trusting Ellesandra to close the door behind them before going to the inn. Presumably, Ellesandra had some coin of their own for the inn, as Star had been 'donated' back the large sum given by Morrun.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched Star for a moment longer. She let the pause extend even after Star reassured her, and wished her a good night. A moment for Star to open up about whatever magic that was. She flexed her thighs, feeling the fully healed skin and that it didn't hurt at all anymore. When nothing came, she just nodded. "Sleep well." The door was shut behind her and she headed off into the main room, smiling to Lissana and Morrun. "She'll be meditating and then heading to sleep to prep for tomorrow, so please don't disturb her unless necessary. Lissana, before I head back to the Inn to do the same myself, would you like any assistance with cleaning dinner up?" They had, after all, just went straight back to Star's room right after dinner. It was only in hindsight that Ellesandra had realized how potentially rude that had been, and was entirely prepared to help clean up or do whatever dish washing would be needed before going to the inn for another night's rest. When she returned bright and early in the morning, she'd be fully armored again and prepared for battle, warrior's ponytail and all.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The lingering moment on Star eroded her. That something was left unsaid, that Ellesandra knew it...Star could not allow it to go without being said. She had thought she wanted it, because it would keep Ellesandra from being upset. If Ellesandra had just left promptly, it would have happened differently. But Star could not accept feeling like she had lied to Ellesandra. So... "...I took your pain," she said just as Ellesandra turned. She then turned and lifted the skirt of her dress to show the location where the wounds had been on Ellesandra. There was no wound to be seen, but there was a slowly fading mark on her skin, a magical line that copied the shape of Ellesandra's wound. Admiring Star's shapely legs and smooth, feminine thighs would have to wait for another time that she wasn't exposing them for a purpose that would likely anger Ellesandra to some measure. "The wound does pass to me initially. But it heals. I am not damaged by this. My body does not suffer broken skin nor bloodloss. It is taken unto my aura instead." She looked at Ellesandra sternly, then. "I need you to hear me when I tell you I am not harmed by this act. I take on the agony of the wound...And it does take from my magical strength." She lowered her skirt again, turning to face Ellesandra once more. "But the mightiest strength of auramancy, of my magic, is known as purity of self. Disease, afflictions, wounds...So long as my aura remains strong, these melt off of me. I have no scars on my body, despite being wounded many times. Of course I can still suffer mortal blows, hence my ability to harden my aura to an impenetrable armor, as it is better to be exhausted than dead. So before you chide me...It is my purpose and desire to take the burdens of others. I know my limits. I will not use this power recklessly or foolishly. But had I been there to heal you when your arm was damaged, I would have saved you from the lingering injury, and would not have suffered it myself beyond however many hours or days of pain I would endure as my aura cleansed me of its influence." She sighed. "...I might still be able to undo what was done, with time. But for now, I simply...Needed to know that I could heal you, if it came to it. If it comes a time where it is martial prowess we require, and you have been critically wounded...Our best chance will be for me to endure the agony instead, and allow you to fight on. So before you think me foolishly taking a wound of yours that I know you're more than capable of enduring yourself...Understand that my mind thinks days, weeks, months ahead of now in this moment." Clearly, with all that she had to say on the matter, she was very much anticipating that Ellesandra would be none too pleased about this revelation of what Star would need to do to heal them. Not a mortal danger but...If Ellesandra was run through, left with a crippling wound...Star would be left suffering intensely for her efforts to heal them. But the utility of it was clear. Even if it meant Star passed out from the pain, she could surge Ellesandra back into the fight. And while against drunk pirates it was unlikely to be anywhere near necessary, there might come a time where it was needed. At least now, with Star keeping to her promise of honesty, Ellesandra had a chance to draw boundaries for it.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had turned, preparing to walk out before pausing when Star spoke up. She stood, frozen for a moment at that first sentence. There was shock, as that had NOT been something she had been expecting at all. Then, the shock quickly morphed into anger. She turned around, eyes narrowed and glaring at Star with a fury that looked like it could burn the room down. She stepped back inside the room, closing the door behind her again, though from here - she didn't know what to do. She obviously wasn't going to stomp towards Star and intimidate her; that wasn't how she would ever deal with her anger. And this wasn't her room to break anything, which was also unhealthy way to deal with her anger. So she stood, jaw clenched and glaring at her as Star explained what happened, showed her, and then try to make excuses for it. All of these words, so much explanation, just for Ellesandra to feel the anger still there. The thing was, it wasn't anger that Star had caused pain on herself for healing her; though Ellesandra hated the idea of that, it was that Star hadn't seen fit to tell her she was testing this. She wouldn't have been happy with the idea, but Star made very good points in that it would be useful to know how it worked, in case it was ever needed on their journey. She hated the idea of it being needed, and as if she needed another reason not to let herself get injured, she resolved to ensure it wasn't. No, overall, she was upset at the ruse. It was the first breach of trust Star had done, and it coming from someone who seemed as pure hearted and honest as Star, that hurt. Well, Ellesandra's form of hurt was lashing out in anger, so it she didn't really feel the hurt itself, but it was there. And then another thought came to her mind. Could Star take the pain from her emotions, too? There was a fear that Star would try, somehow, to remove that 'nonexistant' mountain and take it upon herself. Would Star even be able to? Surely the woman was better at processing emotions than she was, but it had been three years building, being repressed, building more, and being further repressed. If or when it was ever fully released, it would probably crush whoever felt it. "You." The word came out thickly. She had to force it out in a way that could be understood. "Will never do that without explicit permission again. Ever. Do you understand, Miss Lumina?" Ellesandra would not lash out against Star physically, ever, but verbally? Returning back to title, rather than first name, was the minimal indication of how this conversation was part of their business arrangement; not of their budding friendship.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
A nuance to Star's powers was proven in this moment. Ellesandra didn't need to say a word for their feelings to come across. It was instant, and Star recoiled upon seeing the anger. Rather immediately, tears formed in her eyes. Regret. Sadness. Pain. It was writ across her face as the tears flowed down her cheeks; she repressed the sobs that wished to join it, but she couldn't hide the tumultuous emotion that raged in her. "The times it has its uses are times where acquiring explicit permission may not be a luxury," came her response. She was upset, obviously. Wishing she had handled it another way, perhaps. But there was a fire in her eyes that matched Ellesandra's own. "Saving your life may require a decision that moves my body before I consciously make a decision," she continued, her figure trembling, but standing with the conviction with which she risked her life in Cloverport. "And even though you've sought to fight me at every turn to be of use to you, to help you, I won't let anyone stand in the way of keeping you safe. Not even you." She couldn't know the specific reasons for Ellesandra's anger, but a general sense was enough for the immediate moment. She was obviously scared. Not of Ellesandra hurting her. But that she might have hurt Ellesandra. Her words were soft-spoken, spoken through tears. She wasn't wishing to make an argument out of it, or disturb the elven couple. But there was an...Intense concern in her. A flame that burned behind her eyes directly straight at Ellesandra. "That's all this was. When my regular healing failed, that's all I had left. And whether you want to try and hurt me by using my last name to make distance from me or not won't stop me from caring, either. You saved me, and have shown me how much deep kindness you have inside you. That cannot be undone. I will do whatever it takes to ensure we both get to walk away from whatever tries to impede us in our travels. I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me. So just...S-Stop trying to keep me from doing my part!"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The tears should have assuaged some of her anger. They should have warned Ellesandra to back off. Seeing Star react so immediately should have told her to shut up and just leave, before things got worse. Somehow, though, they just made her even more upset. Guilt leaked out of the mountain, and as Star tried to defend her actions, defend that she would do this with or without Ellesandra's permission in the future, Ellesandra was prepared to just leave. Cut the conversation before she did something stupid. And then there was that line. 'I've seen enough people die around me. Enough people hurt trying to protect me.' The mountain broke open and, completely without thought, Ellesandra stepped directly up to Star. "And I've already had one charge give her life for mine, I will NOT have another do the same." She didn't even realize she was saying the words until after they were out. Such was the way anger worked; you spoke subconscious, not even considering the impact or truth of words. The pain as soon as they left her mouth hit hard. She took a step back, hardly holding in the sob that immediately bubbled up from the crack in said mountain. It didn't matter that Star wasn't talking about giving her life for Ellesandra, but just taking her pain and wounds. To her, in this moment, they were one and the same. Star would be taking the punishment that should be Ellesandra's. She couldn't be here with Star, who she knew would be able to see how the guilt and pain completely consumed her. She spun and slammed the door shut behind her before Star could try to follow out, not even looking at Morrun or Lissana as she left the hut. She'd held back the sob just barely, but there were tears on her cheeks. She didn't make her way to her room though, figuring if Star followed she'd assume that's where Ellesandra went. No, she went straight for the meadow, hoping it would be mostly empty that evening.

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Quite a lot of things fell into place in that moment for Star. Her eyes widened. Shock filled her. She was in no state to stop Ellesandra. No state to say anything. To realize that...For Ellesandra, Star's staunch conviction, the desire to do whatever was necessary to care for the knight...It played right into their guilt, into the pain that the knight felt. That every time Star showed valiance in the face of danger, it was undoubtedly making Ellesandra fear that history would repeat itself. Star didn't want to die, but...As Ellesandra slammed the door and stormed out, Star had to sit with her own thoughts and decide...If it came to it, would she give her life for Ellesandra? Would that answer change, knowing they already had someone sacrifice themselves for them? A lot was revealed about the knight's actions without it being directly revealed. And Star would remain in her room for a short while. An hour or so. But the empath was, by some estimations...Incorrigible. Time was needed, yes. But so were apologies. And try as Ellesandra might to elude Star, it remained the unfortunate truth that...A strong emotion was felt by Ellesandra. Very strong. And the stronger an emotion, the more it could guide Star. So she followed them. It was just past sundown. The early beginnings of night, with an orange haze still bleeding over the horizon as it crest over the pond of the meadow. No others were there. All had returned to their homes. And Ellesandra was free to have it to themselves. But after about an hour, Star found her way there. And if Ellesandra was still present, Star stayed out of sight initially. Somewhere close, but not intruding, as if needing to make a final decision on her plan to either walk over and speak, or do something else.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had been thankful it was empty when she arrived. She was laying down in the meadow, not far from where they had been laying just earlier that day. It was a good thing that Star could see emotion, as far away it might be hard to see her, and she was keeping quiet in her sobs. Still, they were sobs. She was curled up on her side, knees pulled up to her chest and her face buried in them. She was trying her best to put the lid back on, to take the guilt and the grief and shove them back down, back into the mountain and just pretend they didn't exist. She couldn't, though. Not entirely. The memory of Marigold looking up into her captors faces. A mix of fear and determination before the blade fell. Ellesandra was wracked with the guilt, and the pain wasn't like one who had lost a charge they weren't close to. It was heartbreak, the feeling that one who had loved another felt at their death. With Stars abilities to see emotions, it was like a major beacon pointing her to where Ellesandra was. And by the time Star found her, she had made little progress in shoring up the hole that had formed. The physical pain that encompassed the emotional, the feeling that her chest was being literally ripped open. Old wounds, the same ones experienced that day, throbbed. Her right arm, her left side, and her left shoulder. But the physical pain was nothing compared to the turmoil that three years of repressing the grief and guilt brought. Ellesandra had never properly processed her death; she hadn't let herself. On the best of days, she pretended it didn't happen. That she was out on a mission, that was it. On the worst, she distracted herself from the guilt. Whatever would do, however she could. She didn't let herself feel it, and when she suddenly admitted to that to Star. That Marigold had died to save her, she just couldn't anymore. It was the first time she'd admitted it in more than her dreams or her thoughts, and putting words to it had made it real.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
It killed Star to see the knight in such a state. To be so stricken, so alone...Star would not stand for it. Ellesandra did not know it, but their anger, their sorrow, their grief, it all left a long, wispy trail of emotion and memory on the aether that Star followed. One she could read. One she could cradle against her and feel the emotion, take unto herself the memory that brought such pain into existence. But she recalled her promise to Ellesandra. She did not dive into the memory, even if it was right in front of her. It was a breach of their trust to do so. She moved out from her place out of sight. Her own tears were plentiful, though she held her sobs in. Her pain was for Ellesandra; this moment was not about her or how she hurt, it was entirely about them. She moved to where they were laying. She laid before them. Close, but not too close. She laid on her side, though not hugging her legs to her chest to hide. She didn't need Ellesandra to notice her or react. Even if it was just that she was here with them, in this moment, so they wouldn't have to be alone as they faced such pain...That was enough. Though of course, if they did notice her, she was sure to raise the arm not pinned under her side to leave open the same comfort to Ellesandra that they offered her, even if she knew the knight was far less likely to accept such physical comforts, least of all from Star herself given what happened with that contact.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The emotions rolled from Ellesandra in waves. Guilt, pain, sorrow, guilt again. The guilt was the strongest thing, influencing more pain and grief than just having had someone close to her die. That she felt fully responsible for the death was what truly hit Ellesandra hard; that she had been tasked to protect someone, and had failed so miserably at her job it had gotten her killed. Well, that wasn't entirely fair, objectively, but Ellesandra was anything but objective in regards to this. The sobs had slowed, but she still lay there, curled up on herself and silent tears running down her cheeks. Her eyes were closed and she was much too distracted to notice Star's approach, so there was no immediate reaction when Star lay down next to her. Ellesandra's face was mostly hidden, with her head down where her forehead pressed against the top of her knees. Through bangs of hair falling around the top of her head Star would be able to see the streaks of tears, and her knuckles were white with how hard she had been holding onto her own legs. With the lack of anyone she trusted or felt comfortable with holding her, Ellesandra held herself. Eventually, she shifted, a discomfort with how she was laying, and that is when she saw Star laying in front of her. Seeing Star obviously surprised Ellesandra and she jumped, her body all but leaving the ground for a moment in the intensity of her surprise, and her eyes gone wide. And then the shame and embarrassment hit, at how she'd reacted to Star, and that Star was now seeing her like this. No one saw her like this. She'd never broken down like this in a situation where anyone had access to her before. Seeing Star's arm raise, she looked at the arm, then Star for a moment, hand moving up to wipe at her face as if to try to make herself presentable. It was a moment of indecision. She wanted the physical comfort, but did she want that from Star? Not just because of the whole touching and emotions thing Star did, but she'd known star for...not even two days, at this point. And Star had already devolved Ellesandra into a sobbing mess. Her eyes moved down to her own body again and then without a word she turned so that her back was to Star, not wanting her to see Ellesandra this way. Not wanting her to see how broken she was inside, and didn't let anyone else see. The guilt was still there, even as it was now successfully being buried again. The start of another mountain; though this one would be significantly smaller.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star did expect a rejection. She didn't take it personally. She knew she was the exception rather than the rule to how quickly people became accustomed to hugging, to touching. It was very different for her, for an empath. It was an expression of her openness and trust in others, for Star had advantages others did not. A nigh flawless insight into someone's heart, into their motivations. A moment's study was all she needed to know if someone wished her harm, either directly or subtly. Ellesandra had no such guarantees. They were their own, only source of comfort. She was okay with this for now. She wanted more, of course. But she wouldn't demand it. She could only show it with her tears, with her sorrow, with the depths of sympathy in her eyes. "I am so...So...So sorry, Ellesandra," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She kept her sobs subdued, still. "For...So many things."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't respond, not at first. She wasn't able to, opening her mouth and feeling just a tight throat and air whistling out. It took her a few moments of trying to calm her emotions to be able to force her throat to loosen up enough to speak. "Don't...apologize for something that is not your fault, Star, or you had no way of knowing." Ellesandra pulled her knees up to her chest again, arms wrapping around them. She was the one who hadn't told anyone anything. Star couldn't be held accountable for saying something that triggered Ellesandra when she had no way of knowing it would. And Star didn't actually do anything wrong, either. She was just trying to do what she thought was right, even if Ellesandra still had a smoldering flame of anger at her taking her pain without discussion. She placed her forehead on her knees, adopting the same position Star had seen her in when she approached, just with her back to Star now.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star was reassured slightly by Ellesandra speaking at all. Not so much by their words; she cared little for absolution, she knew Ellesandra was hurt, and her actions, knowing or not, were at least partly to blame. Star had her stubborn moments, certainly. But she was quicker than most to step back and accept guilt unto herself under most circumstance. Hardly perfect, but...A reminder of what was important, a reminder of the humanity of the moment, was all it took to center herself again here. To remember what mattered. "I will apologize," she said, her voice still soft, yet carrying that selfsame emotional conviction. "...Because someone has to. Your tears have no business falling alone." She paused. She had to choose her words carefully, with Ellesandra so obviously vulnerable. "I was so caught up in my own fears that it blinded me to yours. And I've far less excuse than most for that. I...Was so worried that you would keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing yourself to the point that you would break, to the point that I wouldn't be able to save you...It made me feel...Desperate. It's...No excuse. Just an explanation. So you know that though every action I've taken, I've kept you in my mind. I know the things I do can seem...Reckless. Thoughtless, even. And I can promise you it's nowhere near the truth, but...I know that can't stop that deep fear in you. Just like it can't stop it in me. So...I promise all the things I've said, still. I promise I won't pry. I promise, however, that I'll still be here, every step of the way. And that I want to know...I want to be here for you. But that I'll let you decide what to share with me." A pause for breath. "...And most of all I promise that I'll never stop fighting to stay alive. I won't let death claim me. I can't. And as much as you'll let me...I'll rely on you to make that a reality." Another brief pause. "I...Didn't come here to make you talk, though. I didn't come here to make you do anything. So you don't...Have to say anything. I just hope you'll let me stay with you, so you don't have to have to cry alone. Because my heart can't bear that."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She waited, listening to Star but not really knowing what to respond to. And was there even an expectation of a response? Probably not. She appreciated that Star promised not to pry, but that still didn't make her feel comfortable with touching Star. Ellesandra didn't let anyone touch her, really; she didn't let herself be vulnerable like that, and that wasn't even considering Star's ability which immediately made it so that the walls Ellesandra did have up meant absolutely nothing. It didn't matter how good she was at hiding her emotions from everyday people; Star could literally see right through her when it came to that. So touching Star made her feel even more vulnerable than just a normal hug. The previous embrace as Star broke down earlier had been more than Ellesandra was comfortable with, but something she felt like she should do, was expected and appropriate for the situation. Now? As much as she might internally want Star to reach out and touch her back, or even cuddle up against her and hold her, she also hated the idea. And so, she laid there as she worked to finish calming herself back down. To push her emotions down enough that she could breath and exist normally again. Her chest still ached from it; the pain was still there, she couldn't get rid of it entirely. She could, however, get rid of the worst of it. Her throat was sore with the intensity of the crying at first, and her eyes puffy and red. Her nose was runny and she sniffed, irritated at it. Finally, she moved to stand up. She didn't look at Star, keeping her face turned away, back to her while she looked up at the sky. "We did say we'd come see the stars tonight." She murmured, as if that had been the reason they'd been out there - not because Ellesandra had broken down, but because they were keeping up on their promise to star watch in the meadow.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had waited with Ellesandra without another word. Without pushing herself onto them. She just watched their emotions, the turmoil, and the repression. She disagreed with that repression. It made her want to do something drastic again. To pin Ellesandra down and scream at them to stop it, to let themselves feel their emotions instead of ignoring them. But there was only so much she could push the knight before she started pushing them away with what she thought to be caring actions. It meant nothing if it evoked a defensive response that could not be overcome with sincerity and concern. "We did," she said softly to Ellesandra, then moved onto her back, looking up at the stars. "...So won't you lay with me a short while and look at them?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Hadn't she been laying here enough, crying? The thought passed her mind, and how much she just wanted to go back to her room at the inn and curl up on her bed. Maybe cry a little more, though she doubted she had anything left in her. How could one have so many tears? She glanced at Star out of the corner of her eye and took a deep breath, before moving to sit down in the meadow nearby. It wasn't laying down next to Star, but she was still keeping her company, and her eyes turned upwards towards the sky nonetheless. She sat with most of her weight on her rump, knees brought up but spread open this time, with her arms wrapped around them widely and hands held together in front of her. Her head was tilted back, eyes tracing some of the constellations she knew - which weren't many. "Any constellations or stars or anything of particular importance to your family? With your naming theme being all celestial objects like that, that is." There. Conversation that was completely neutral to the pain Ellesandra felt. Trying to be normal.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star smiled quietly. "...The night sky is different in my homeland. I was young enough at the time that the memories aren't as clear as they could be but...The constellations here aren't the same. I'll show you the constellation named after the hero of my realm when we get there. It's called 'Purity'. It's a symbol of hope. The stars align to spread out, curling slightly upward, with pockets of stars in vaguely straight lines extending out from the other stars. It looks like a pair of angel wings. It's a beautiful sight." She smiled, though her eyes were still misty. "I don't know the constellations here, despite my time here. It's not my home. Though being away from where I was born so long, and with the place I was born doubtlessly left as nothing but overgrown ruins now...I don't know if I can rightly call that place home, either. I haven't had a place to call home since I was cast away." She paused, then shook her head. "Gods...Sorry. You just asked about the stars, didn't you?" She sighed. "...They're beautiful, here. Just like you said they would be."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She glanced sideways at Star as she talked about home, briefly, before returning her eyes up to the stars. "A constellation of angelic wings, huh?" A symbol of hope. She had to fight back the urge to scoff at the idea. She lowered her gaze back down to the meadow, looking out over it in what light was provided by the stars and the moon that evening. "Stop apologizing when it's not necessary, Star. Stand up for yourself and take up the space you need, or want." She would slowly break that habit of Star, apologizing for unnecessary things, if she stayed with Star very long. Or at least, that was her goal. "Home can be anywhere, or someone. Right now, it sounds like your mom is your home, and you're looking to return to her. If you get there and find that home has been destroyed, you'll grieve, and then you'll find a new home. It's transitory, isn't it?"

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star pouted a little when Ellesandra chided her for apologizing. It was hardly a big deal, so it was taken with a light heart rather than some serious admonishment of her character. "You should probably think twice before you encourage me to be even more stubborn against you, you know," she said with a glance over at the knight in turn. "I don't know if you realize how much I already hold back around you. I know I'm not exactly normal in that regard, but I've never been one to be shy about emotion." She let her gaze linger on Ellesandra for a while with those words. Not an overly heavy tone, but...That selfsame conviction appeared again here. That was her domain. The thing she stood for, even as it balanced against respecting Ellesandra's boundaries. "If I gave all that my heart desired to assert myself with you, well...You'd probably go running for the hills. I can be awfully scary when it comes to emotional matters," she said, offering a playful smile. Star? Scary? Hard to imagine. But she did listen to the words about home, bringing her eyes back to the stars above. "...It is, you're right. We're just guests in the lives of so many people that we meet. We might never see this place again. And there might not be a home waiting for me where we're going." She didn't go anywhere with those words. Just an echo of what they said, perhaps to affirm it all in her heart as she stared at the night sky. A pensive air came over her. It'd be easy to tell, as it generally was with Star, what she was feeling. Longing, perhaps. Depth of thought. A pain bubbling in her, one she was well familiar with. It hurt, still, clearly. Her desire to return home. To close this chapter of her life, so she could grieve if she must, and move forward again.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She pursed her lips at the stubborn comment. Did she want Star to be more stubborn? Ellesandra was silent as Star went on about her emotions, and home. There was a sudden defensiveness to her and she had to fight the urge to slide a little further away from Star. Leaning forward, she repositioned so she could place her chin atop her knees, gazing out over the meadow. "Assert your own emotions as much as you want." She said, eventually. "But I've drawn a firm boundary around my own. And I expect you to respect that boundary, as much as your powers allow you to." They would certainly make Star respecting her boundary hard, and Ellesandra recognized that. Normally, her boundary involved not prying into her emotions at all, but it seemed that was all but impossible for Star. Still, there was restraint Star had seemed to show. Ellesandra wasn't going to force her to hold herself back, but she would encourage said restraint in regards to herself. "We should get back, though. Long day tomorrow and I'm sure we both need the rest to prepare. Especially you with needing to meditate to ensure you are fully prepared for what you might be asked to do tomorrow."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star just bore a grin at Ellesandra's words. She refrained from comment, despite mentally imagining Ellesandra saying 'assert yourself! Claim what you want!' followed immediately by 'no wait not like that'. A terribly oversimplified thought made just for amusement, and just for her to hold onto. Something that might have Ellesandra wondering what she found so amusing, but beyond that she rose up to a seated position. She nodded. "I know. But it was important to me that I be with you in this moment. You're important to me, and I'll always do all I can to make sure you know that." She said that, then rose up to her feet, moving immediately towards where she would be sleeping, though she did look over her shoulder and smile. "Good night, Ellesandra. I'll see you at dawn. Sleep well."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Her eyes narrowed at Star as she walked away. Ellesandra was important to her, after just two days? "Foolish." She muttered to herself, quiet enough to ensure Star didn't hear her. There was disbelief there, then irritation at Star putting herself at risk like that. To care for someone so quickly was an easy way to get yourself hurt, even if Star could see someone's intentions. People might not intend to hurt others, but they did it all the time anyways. She started her walk back to the Inn, trailing Star long enough to see that she made it back to Morrun's place safely, and then taking the path Morrun had shown her the night before to the Inn to settle in for the night. She did exactly as she'd wanted to before, locking her door then curling up in her bed, covers thrown over her head, and let herself cry more. The remaining pain and guilt that she hadn't been able to repress released, and she finally cried herself to sleep. In the morning, her head ached. Her sinuses were clogged from the crying last night and her eyes were still puffy and red. She slipped out of the covers and began getting ready for the day, doing what she could with water provided to clear up her face so she didn't look like she'd spent the whole night crying despite having done so. She had woken at the first rays of the sun shining through the window, but that meant she hadn't had much time to get ready and put her armor on before they would be leaving most likely. She'd planned to wake earlier, but exhausted eyes from last night had prevented that. So it was about last minute that Ellesandra arrived to Morrun's with her pack on her back, armor on, hair up in a high ponytail, and rapier strapped to her right hip like normal, knocking at the front door if they weren't already outside.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Ellesandra's restlessness was helped little by their dream. It was not one where the woman had lucidity, so it was easier to chalk up to simply tumults of the mind. But in this dream, Ellesandra wandered through a forest that was possessed by endless darkness. No passage out. No certainty of the way forward. And lurking in the edge of Ellesandra's periphery every few minutes was that same inky shadow. That black mass of darkness that stood with the reaper's scythe. A foreboding presence. One that watched, silently. One that did not impede, but its displeasure was clear. It never attacked. It simply watched, then vanished if observed. It was unmistakably the same entity that had tormented Ellesandra on the previous night. But was the demon just a manifestation of Ellesandra's repressed fears, or something else? It would be impossible to know. Ellesandra could only know that even when pushing forward, retreating, attacking, or calling out to this black monster, it did not respond. It vanished before the knight could do anything, always out of reach, yet always watching. Ellesandra would wake in time, granting reprieve from the endless black forest. Their sleep was not the most restful with less time than they might need, but it wasn't particularly disturbed. Perhaps even a break from recurring nightmares; likely less scary than seeing Marigold in their dreams. The result was an almost fully refreshing slumber, but with lingering fatigue to shake off. Some time walking would do the trick. Ellesandra's knock was met with a swift answer. It was breakfast time again, and some notice had been taken of the knight's desires. Ellesandra's plate was given an extra helping of breakfast meats in the way of sausage and bacon, while Star's had a smaller helping of these while piling it more full of fruit and vegetable. Lissana was clearly paying attention. Morrun had syrup-soaked pancakes again, which he ate with glee. Smalltalk was the air for the morning, unless the knight had specific questions or subjects to raise. If not, the group was destined to part ways here, and Morrun and Lissana were sure to send the two off with some prepared bundles of rations. Fruit preserves, nuts, berries, cured meats, even two portions of salted cuts of meat that would last a day or so on the road without spoiling to serve as a good night's meal over a campfire if nothing else could be secured. There was an obvious priority to what would need to be eaten first, but it certainly beat roasted squirrel in terms of quality. It would be the last chance the two had to say goodbye unless they chose to return to this grove another day, or some time in the future.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra definitely hadn't slept well, with the paranoia of that shadow lurking everywhere. And now in the waking world, Ellesandra's paranoia continued. The shadow was too coincidental, to be in both dreams, for Ellesandra to shrug it off. Now, she was looking around, keeping an eye out and watching the shadows as she'd gone to Morrun's, and even while eating. Ellesandra stared at the extra meat on her plate for a moment, blinking a few times and looking over to Lissana in confusion, before eating it anyways. She was quiet throughout the breakfast, introspective and obviously tired, and when they were given all of the supplies for the road, she smiled at Lissana and Morrun politely in thanks. Her dreams had been bothering her, leading her to be even more quiet than normal that morning. As they prepared to go, Ellesandra was looking around, then looking to Star. "Are we supposed to be meeting up with anyone this morning?" As compared to last night, Ellesandra's emotions looked much better controlled and repressed. The mountain was now significantly smaller, and there was a small hole in it that Ellesandra didn't even notice, but the emotions were still held down under it. The main emotions today were a combination of embarrassment, at how she'd acted the night before and how Star had seen her, combined with that paranoia, and concern for Star if something went wrong here.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star had noticed, obviously, that something was different. Ellesandra wasn't themselves, but to some degree that was to be expected given the night prior. Star kept up some smalltalk during breakfast. The provisions were taken with humble thanks, and hugs were given to both of the elves before departing. They didn't seem to react to the touch. Perhaps they already knew what it was like to touch Star? Either way, she smiled at her companion, concern in her eyes but one that was passive. There were other things to focus on at the moment, and time to talk on the road. She nodded. "The guard is gathering at the gate. We should head there. The departure will begin in an hour or so, so we're in no rush to be among the group, but there might be an address to hear before that." Star then began to lead the way to the gate, with Ellesandra in tow. But along the way, well, she couldn't help but ask: "...Is...Everything all right, Ellesandra? I mean, aside from the obvious from last night. You seem...On edge." More than seem, she could see it. "Is it just worries about the fight ahead of us?"

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched the hugs with eyebrows raised. So many people were okay just randomly touching someone they hardly knew; Ellesandra couldn't understand it. Even before the incident, only a rare few were allowed to get close and hug Ellesandra like that. She shook her head, following Star towards the gate and keeping her eye out, when Star asked about her being on edge. "I -" To say she had dreams of something in the shadows? Biting her lip, she glanced sideways at Star, then back to the road ahead of them. "I have a gut feeling something bad might happen, so I'm on guard." It wasn't a lie, persay. It wasn't the whole truth either, though, and Ellesandra knew that Star would be able to tell that. Even without the ability to see emotions, Ellesandra was being too paranoid and guarded to just have a 'bad gut feeling'. Specifically, Ellesandra was watching the shadows, not specific people. She had a bad gut feeling that the shadow wasn't just a dream, considering it had been in two different dreams now. She had a bad feeling it meant more, though Ellesandra didn't know what exactly. Maybe the threat wouldn't be today at all, maybe it would be later, but she wasn't going to let her guard down and have it appear from the shadows without her knowing.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star could very easily tell that the answer was deflective. She frowned. She could see that there was more to the answer, though it did seem to be at least hinting at the truth. The unease she could see in the knight was a solid indication of that much. "I don't suppose you'd care to elaborate? If you have something in mind, it might be prudent to share. Something that I might be able to keep an eye out for as well. I don't expect much to go wrong today but...If I can know of any potential dangers, even if it's just a feeling...Two pairs of eyes are better than one. I take...Your worries seriously, you know. Not that I need any more reason to look out for my own self-preservation, but you being distracted could cause its own problems. If I know what you're worried about, I'll be able to watch and call out to you." A specific decision to frame it as her looking to Ellesandra for help, rather than facing the danger herself. She certainly seemed to have taken Ellesandra's fears seriously.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She pursed her lips together. Damnit, Star was making sense. Sighing, she looked around again to ensure no one could just overhear. It felt a little childish, admitting she was on edge because of dreams. "I've had...bad dreams the past two nights. It's not unusual; I do have recurring nightmares, but they both involved something completely new this time. A shadow that seemed to imply you were in danger. The first night it did, anyways. Last night, it was just...following me. Everywhere I went, it was there, somewhere in the shadows, watching. The first night I thought was just a strange nightmare, but that the same shadow was there for a second night in an entirely different dream, not recurring, has me concerned it might be something magical and not just imaginative." There was concern that Star would just laugh at her for being scared of her dreams, but it was minor. If she was then - who gave a damn, right? Ellesandra was taking her job seriously, and right now that seemed to be a potential, real threat. She was going to treat it as such and if she were more paranoid than normal on a day they were potentially marching into a battle, well, that wasn't really a bad thing was it?

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star frowned at the revelation. "...Hm. I recall Nina telling me she had similar experiences in the past. I had thought it was related to her trauma, however, as neither of us ever encountered such a thing in our travels. But for you to experience it too...It can't be a coincidence. Tell me, did the shadow wield a scythe? That was the only other detail that Nina conveyed to me as significant." Hardly one to laugh at the news, Star was clearly taking it very seriously, and would have even if not for the past correlation. "I don't want to make you feel I'm dismissing your concerns, and I'll certainly be on the lookout too...But I hope it's reassuring to hear that we were traveling for years and didn't encounter such a being, whatever it was. It might be an entity that is contained within dreams, but...I'd rather not speculate with so little information."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra came up to a halt when Star mentioned the scythe. She turned concerned eyes onto Star, reaching out to stop Star from walking as well with a brief touch to her arm and ensure they faced eachother. "The scythe didn't make an appearance last night, but the night before it did. It was going to cut you clean in two. And said that you were in danger and would die on your journey." Had her and Nina, Star's previous guardian, had encounters with the same creature? Why was the creature warning Star's guardians but not her? She crossed her arms, eyes narrowing at Star herself. For a brief moment, there had been suspicion that it was Star's doing, but she quickly waved that away. While technically possible, she couldn't imagine Star manipulating someone like that. And Star didn't know Marigold, so how would she have been able to see that in order to play on those emotions in the dream? Unless Star could see more than she'd let on...suspicion rose again, but was shoved down. "It might be reassuring that in years you two didn't encounter it, but the fact it reached out to both your previous guardian and myself is more than coincidence, Star."

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star nodded. "I'm certainly not delighted by that news either," she said, showing a flash of...Concern? Fear? A bit of both. "Like I said. I will be vigilant. I'd dismissed the danger before, but I can see that whatever it is has some interest in those around me, if not specifically me myself. I'll be on guard." She did seem a bit shaken, but it had been clear many times over that Star wasn't one to let fear grip her. She sought to master her own emotions, after all, and serenity and calm were literally exuded from her very aura, so any actual show of fear was rare from her thus far. She stayed in place as long as Ellesandra did, not wanting to rush them if they wanted to discuss further. "I won't let any pirates have my head, neither will I a dark spectre. If it is a threat...We will face it together, and I will support you. I won't face it alone, if it is something to be faced. I hope you'll take the same stance."

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt even more disturbed, now that she knew this wasn't limited to just her own dreams. The image of of the shadow's scythe cutting towards marigold, then star, then marigold, then star - the pain from last night seeped out of that hole, just a little and Ellesandra winced at the imagery that came into her mind. No, she wasn't going to let the reminder cause her to focus on those emotions again. A deep breath was taken, before she nodded and began walking again. "Well, my job is your protection, so I expect you to run and trust me not to martyr myself if I tell you to run." She didn't actually expect Star to do that. She hoped Star would, but did she trust Star to put her own life over potentially Ellesandra's? No. She fully expected Star would disobey a request like that and knock her over the head for even making it, but Ellesandra would at the very least try, in a situation like that. They hadn't really fought together enough, or at all minus that initial interaction when Ellesandra first stumbled upon Star, for Ellesandra to feel comfortable and like they were a team in battle. It would be a while, before that happened most likely. "Just try not to exhaust yourself so much I need to carry you out of danger though." A teasing note, to lighten the mood.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I do trust you. And I trust you not to tell me to leave unless it's an absolute last resort. You're not allowed to die on me, either," she said, meeting their demand with her own. Obviously neither one could help it if death came for them with overwhelming force. But the understanding the two were trying to find with one another was to do all they could to live. Both had seen too much death of the ones filling the opposite role, even if that amount was a single, irreplaceable person. She then smiled at the teasing note. "Emergencies only, promise, even if you do give a good piggy-back ride," she said, raising a hand up as if swearing an oath on the matter as her smile grew. With that settled, and the mood a tiny bit lighter, she moved along with Ellesandra to the gate. It was time to make their move. And move they would; the gathering at the gate was an impressive number of soldiers. Enough to vaguely match the numbers of the pirates, based on estimations. Walking around the city and seeing what sort of ship the pirates had, there were in the ballpark of fifty pirates, not counting the five dead ones. Looking around, there were just about thirty five elves gathered, most of which had both a longbow and a shortsword for armaments. Three of these elves were wearing green robes instead of leather armor, identifying them as the healers. Star moved to stand with them; around them was Ellesandra's company, seven elves with simple spears and iron kite shields, as well as longbows. The rear guard seemed more specifically focused on close combat, with the remaining elves looking specifically geared for longer range combat. A few at the front were donning half-plate with two sheathed shortswords. Not a siege army by any measure, but certainly a force to be reckoned with. The directions were delivered by an older, though gracefully aged elven man who spoke of sanctity of the grove, and many of the points that Star had touched on, with callout specifically to how they had harmed a respected member of the grove in Lissana. The knowledge that one of their own had been harmed did seem to ignite a fire in the standing men and women, which was unlikely to surprise given the communal nature of this settlement. There was discussion that the elite guard would remain at the grove to keep the civilians secure, delivered with a line about not fretting for home while purging the lawless threats of their neighbors. Of course, the entire speech was delivered in elvish, so there was a chance Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it! Star certainly did, keeping a smile about her as she listened. But before long, the speech was over, and the group was on the move. Orders were relayed, the group split into smaller teams and moved together, with a few select individuals lugging large packs, presumably of supplies and/or food. One of the elven men standing at the front stayed back to join with the others of the rear guard, presumably the team commander. He specifically nodded to Ellesandra, acknowledging them as part of the fighting force, but didn't give any specific instruction other than motioning for the rear guard and the healers to follow. The guardsman naturally took up position both in front and behind the healers, ensuring they were the most heavily protected; the bulk of the forward force was the general forces, so most of the rear guard stayed behind to keep the squishy healers surrounded. As standard as things came, if it wasn't for the threat of the shadow that had Ellesandra so paranoid, it might even border on boring.

</p>
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, accepting what Star said. She had no plan to just off and die for no reason, if she could avoid the death. She quickly identified which group was the healers, and followed Star over to them. Her eyes roamed the rear guard, sizing up all of the elves there while the speech was being made. Not knowing elven, Ellesandra didn't understand a word of it. Well, okay she might have caught one or two words just from hearing them multiple times in travel, but nothing to actually understand what was being said. The nod from the team commander caused a nod to be given in return, and Ellesandra moved to walk off to the side. Staying with Star directly would look like a lack of trust in the guards and would likely impede on her ability to interact with the other healers and make any plans necessary there; they needed to meet and trust one another and such for what might be coming up. The same could be said for Ellesandra and the rest of the rear guard, but she didn't try to integrate with them. A well formed company didn't need a stray mercenary stepping in and ruining any of their organization. Ellesandra instead walked off to the side, where she could easily see Star and get to her if something were to happen, but also keep an eye out around them. With the threat of the shadow, Ellesandra kept her guard up despite the number of soldiers around. None of them were looking for something in the shadows, but Ellesandra - and maybe Star - were. So for the entire trip, Ellesandra lightly rested her hand on her rapier and watched, used to long treks like this.

</p>
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
The trip took until dusk. There were multiple organized stops for the soldiers to take half an hour to tend to personal business in the woods, rest their feet, and take some time to eat. There was no point arriving exhausted and dying. Everyone had to be alert on arrival, and the instructions given ensured they would be. Star seemed content to chat with the other elves, though she did so in elvish, as seemed to be the preferred language for obvious reasons. A confirmation that Star did indeed speed more than just common. She was ever the social butterfly, though even in elvish it would easy to pick up on the shy mannerisms of the mystic. Eager to be close to others and be merry, but with that selfsame demure attitude. Star did look around at times, and was sure to check in with Ellesandra during the rest stops. Just to confirm they hadn't seen anything, and to assess their emotional state. Nothing unusual there, or during the entire trip. So it came. The moment of assault. The town was cloaked in the fading light of the nearly set sun, people were returning to their homes. A small contingent of elves moved from the main force and into the city, bows at the ready and arrows nocked. They clung to the walls, moved through the shadows. An initial force that capitalized on the element of surprise, seeking to find locations and take out targets of opportunity in the city. The healers, including Star, set up off the main road in a medium sized clearing with easy access from the road, but the elvish spellcasters cast some magic upon the other edges of the clearing which raised thorny vines up through the gaps in the trees, sealing the clearing to a single entry while allowing in an emergency for the spell to be undone and retreat into the forest. Naturally, the rear guard commander calmly issued orders to his force to station around the entrance to the clearing, but out of sight. Vigilant, but not telegraphing the location. Two of them ascended up into trees to conceal themselves and act as scouts, some others took up posts amidst the trees. The captain instructed Ellesandra and two other elves to act as ones who would receive, guard, and direct wounded back to the guarded clearing. This also ensured that Ellesandra would have view over the city, as the port city was on mildly lower elevation by the water than its surrounding landscape. Just as when approaching from the south, Ellesandra would have a view over a good portion of the city, its port, and the ships in port. Decently far away, to be certain. But that distance didn't stop the knight from feeling...Something. Something sinister lurked. Something dark. The creeping dread of the shadow was theirs to feel, despite the shadow being nowhere to be seen around them. Focusing on the feeling, it certainly did seem to be coming from the city. More specifically, somewhere amidst the pier, on one of the boats. Far enough away that it could not pose a true threat. But the sensation was the same. Was Ellesandra just being paranoid? Was it some trick? Some spell cast on them? It could be a million different things. But that distant, foreboding feeling was not coming from within. Something else was making the knight's spine tingle, making their skin rise with goosebumps..
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet for most of the trip. During the rests she'd greet Star and ensure she was holding up okay, not getting too tired from the march, and chat with a soldier in two in common when their curiosity got the better of them and they wanted to know who she was. She just introduced herself as Star's hired guard, a mercenary who travelled the lands and hired herself out to caravans, individual travelers like Star, and merchants who are concerned about bandits on the road. This seemed to cause them to dismiss her, which Ellesandra didn't mind at all. While she'd served in an army before, she hadn't actually spent much time marching with them because she'd quickly been pulled for personal guard duty and the work that went into being a soldier was very different than the work that went into being a guard. They were not interchangeable, at least not efficiently. They kept their eyes out throughout the march, accepting their stand-off status from the rest of the rear guard. She knew she'd just get in their way; even if they fought like the soldiers she'd been trained with, it had been too long. Plus, with them being elves and knowing the little she knew about how they tended to fight, she wouldn't be able to keep up with them in their own way. When they got to the location, Ellesandra had stayed back, frowning as her paranoia seemed to just increase at the sudden bad feeling she was getting. She nodded to the orders she'd been given, accepting them and not arguing or causing issue, but her eyes kept straying out towards the peer. That bad feeling felt way too similar to the shadow in her dreams, and she looked back towards where Star was. Could she feel it? Could she sense Ellesandra, if she looked? Ellesandra didn't quite know how her emotional sight worked, but with how they were currently separated and her being prepared to receive injured, she might not be able to talk to Star before the chaos began. Frowning down at the city again, watching as the elves did exactly as Ellesandra knew she couldn't do, she kept her hand resting on her rapier. The bad feeling didn't go away, and Ellesandra tried something. She didn't know if Star would be able to feel it or see it, not while Star wasn't actively looking at or paying attention to Ellesandra, but it was worth a shot. She tried to take the feeling of caution, the concern and paranoia that she was feeling, and focused solely on that feeling. It made it bigger, more worrisome for her, but also she was trying to make it look like a beacon for Star, so Star would know that Ellesandra was concerned about something. "Cursed emotions." She muttered to herself, not sure if she had done anything, and after only a moment or two of that deciding not to focus on it more so as to not send herself into a paranoid panic and attack the first movement she saw. She needed to be at least relatively cool-headed when the chaos broke out.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Had Ellesandra's plan worked? While the knight might not be able to be certain, the results were hard to argue. Star separated from her group, passing reassurances to those who looked concerned that she was leaving the protected area, to approach Ellesandra. Things were still calm. She might not get another chance, she surmised, to speak to the knight. And when she did approach, the knight's experiment would prove validated: "What's wrong?" Star asked as she walked up beside Ellesandra. She looked out over the city with no specific reaction forming upon her face, then back to the knight. Concern was upon her features. "Do you see something?" Seemed she had been able to see Ellesandra's beacon, and didn't seem to be picking up on the same sensation, unless it for some reason wasn't bothering her the same way it bothered Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced back at Star and her hand tightened on her rapier at the sudden words. She hadn't expected Star to actually approach and say anything, frowning and looking around at how she was no longer back in the protected encampment the rest of the healers were. The idea had been just to ensure Star was on the lookout, not letting her guard down. Still, best to just explain and get her back to where she was protected, right? Turning, Ellesandra pointed towards the pier, where she was feeling that odd sensation from. "I feel something bad from that direction. It...feels similar to the shadow. I just wanted to ensure you were keeping your guard up, so be careful." It was interesting that Star couldn't feel it, the one who could usually see emotions and such, but perhaps that wasn't too odd? Her previous guardian could see the shadow in her dreams, but Star hadn't been able to. Was it somehow haunting Star, but not directly? She didn't know, and honestly didn't know enough about creatures that might be able to do that, or other magics that would. She shifted uneasily, glancing around, and then back to Star. "So get back in there, I'll see you when we bring people in, but don't let your guard down just because there are guards all around you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
Star looked over to where Ellesandra pointed. Again, nothing specifically seemed to jump out at her, but she looked back to Ellesandra and nodded. "I understand," she said simply. "I'll keep an eye out. If there are any malevolent presences that come close, I will call for you." She smiled. A reminder that someone with ill-intent, even if there was some duplicitous scheme afoot, would not be able to sneak past her, as well as an assurance that she wouldn't do something dumb on her own. A reinforcement of her commitment to letting Ellesandra be her guardian. With that, she moved calmly back to the protected area. Some time then passed. The tension in the air rose as silence fell over the city. The covert beginnings of the operation were hard to read. Was everything going smoother than expected? Or had something gone wrong? The answer might never be known, but it was not overlong before the start of the chaos was upon them; a magical bolt of light shot up into the air, exploding high in the sky to shift into a massive beacon of light in the shape of the holy symbol of Corellon - a crescent moon with starry fixtures overlaid on the midsection of the crest. It was the signal to start the assault, clearly, as the elves set to charge in all at once rose their fists with a battle cry and began down into the city. The beacon hung high in the air, shining light down on the city that had been bathed in night by the time the assault began. Then, the beacon shuddered with magic, and the illusory roar of a dragon bellowed out from it. Screams from civilians could be heard as they ran from the roar to the safety of their homes. An effort to clear the streets and prevent innocents from being caught in the carnage. It was difficult to observe any direct encounters from the vantage point beyond the city limits, but the small dots of movement could be tracked in the sections of street that were visible. The pier was the most easily seen from beyond the city, and indeed the pirate ship had its own commotion. Pirates emerged onto the deck and began to pour out down the connected ramp to the dock, charging into the city to meet the elvish incursion. But it wasn't long before the wounded began to arrive; there was a clear effort from the elves to minimize loss of life on their side, as the soldiers that came back initially were sporting light wounds. Enough that they could keep fighting, just not at their best. A few debilitating injuries did make their way through after the first few, however, and the number of injuries certainly might strike Ellesandra as higher than expected. Were these the same idiotic, arrogant pirates they had faced? While these elvish soldiers were by no means trained enough to go toe to toe with a knight, they were still disciplined enough that working together to put down such a threat ought to be easier than the steady flow of injured made it seem. No dead had shown up quite yet, and many of those who were injured were capable of heading back into the city to fight the good fight some more, but with what was known about the enemy, it certainly might tickle at one's suspicion. Then, explosions began to resound from within the city. Loud ones. Bombs, of some sort. Loud enough to echo through the chaotic thrum of distant, shouting voices and blades meeting blades. Soon after the bombs started to sound, a heap of wounded began to arrive with grievous wounds - bones protruding from legs, limbs blown off, half-burnt faces and blackened leather armor filled with dozens of shards of ceramic. The first few dead. The frequency and number of injuries were quick to put a strain on the healers, including Star. A cursory glance would be all it would take to see the fatigue building on all of them. They were going to be tapped out before too long, and there didn't seem to be any end to the wounded, or the fight.  
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The calm before the storm was, in some ways, worse, than the fight itself. She watched, eyeing the town and waiting for it to happen. The feeling had never gone away, and she found her eyes straying towards the pier over and over, trying to figure out if it was ever moving closer to them, or at all. The illusory magic that broke out to signal the attack was impressive, causing Ellesandra's eyebrows to raise, but she didn't comment on it. A good way to get citizens off the street, even if it clearly signaled to the enemy something was going on. At first, as the few injured soldiers came in, Ellesandra was getting annoyed at the state of their wounds. This wasn't her encampment to give orders around though; she was just there to help and to guard Star, so she kept her complaints and irritation to herself. The concern was obvious, that these small wounds were going to tax the healers when it wasn't necessary and prevent them from being able to handle the larger and more dire wounds. Maybe the elves were assuming they wouldn't get many of those, but you didn't make assumptions like that when anything could go wrong in a fight. Ellesandra helped those who needed it over to the healers tents then came back to the front to do the same again, eyes flicking towards the battle frequently. The bombs exploding happened just as she was returning to the entrance and she paused, staring at the smoke rising in the air. "Willing to bet that wasn't us." She mumbled, uncaring if the other soldiers around her heard or not. She narrowed her eyes at the town, wondering how the pirates were putting up such a fight. Either they had known something was going on, they had a lot more numbers than was originally assumed, or they'd gotten reinforcements somewhere. Or maybe a combination of them. Any of these sounded bad for the elves though; had they potentially taken over the city's defenses and turned them inward onto the elves? She soon didn't have time to think about this as the more dire injuries were brought forward, moving quickly to help bring the injured soldiers into the tents as stable as possible to prevent pain before going out to get more. At this rate, the healers would be overwhelmed, and on her second trip back with a soldier who had bad burns and his shin bone sticking out of his leg, she stepped up next to wherever Star was and murmured - "If they haven't already, you need to convince the other healers to put off anyone who is obviously going to die or obviously not going to die and focus on the ones you can save. Healing every small cut isn't sustainable." Hopefully the healers knew that, but she at least wanted to ensure Star was following it. She knew how much Star hated seeing death, and the concern was there for her even through the caution and paranoia that still settled within Ellesandra.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was certainly a rising unease among the other soldiers around Ellesandra. The bombs, the flow of injuries, it had everyone Ellesandra could see wearing worry for their comrades and the success of the operation. They had intended to blitz in and scare the pirates off, then sink the fleeing ship. Pirates were selfish. They wouldn't lay down their lives to protect a captain they didn't respect or fear, and it was far more likely they would run than face death for someone else. Or at least, that was the common understanding, the one that this plan was based on. Yet so far, it didn't seem to be going that way. They were facing fierce resistance. Star looked up when she saw Ellesandra. The instruction given was met with a nod. "Mmn...We've been keeping our magical healing in reserve, using the supplies we brought for the lighter wounds, and stabilizing those we know we can't get back into the fight with what we have. But something is wrong, Ellesandra. The fight should have been over by now, shouldn't it?" she asked, looking at her knightly companion with dread in her eyes. She wasn't saying it, but the implication was there in her eyes. Was what Ellesandra had felt somehow responsible? The shadowy essence was still in the city, through it was no longer on the ship. It was...Roaming. Just as Star was asking this of Ellesandra, a shaken elvish soldier began to make a commotion with some of the rear guard. The man had blood over his face and leathers, and his right arm was limp and held by his left, suggesting it was broken. The elf had tears in his eyes as he screamed something in elvish at his comrade. The words might mean nothing, but the tone suggested a desperate plea of some sort.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pursed her lips and nodded. Yes, the fight should have been largely over by now, but obviously it wasn't. Obviously, something else was going on here. Turning to see the elven man yelling something in elvish at his comrade, she took a deep breath. "They should retreat and reconsider their situation. And that feeling...it's moving through the city now, Star." She mumbled. She had no sway over the elven commanders or soldiers, though. As much as she disliked the idea of the elven soldiers continuing to fight, she had been trained to follow orders in a situation like this. She hadn't been trained to be the one making the decisions, so for now she would go back to doing what she had been ordered to. For as long as there were still soldiers fighting and coming back, she would ensure they got back to the healers to at least be looked at, glancing over her shoulder at the town and keeping track of where the shadow was - or whatever the feeling was coming from, if it wasn't the shadow specifically.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a difficult look at Ellesandra when hearing their words. She obviously seemed inclined to agree, that further loss of life was not worth the cost. But she also had been the one to advocate for this. For her to go and ask for retreat now would not put her in good graces with the leaders. It wasn't her place. She just nodded to Ellesandra, with a look of guilt overtaking all else as she set about getting back to her duties. Was it a sunk cost situation? That some had died already, and it was now too late to give in? Was it that the lost life needed to become greater before the bleeding would stop? One could not know, but anyone familiar with elvish culture knew it to be a stubborn one, one which did not accept changing their mind easily. Were they going to fight to the last? Time would tell. But before such thoughts could be explored significantly, Ellesandra was perhaps the only one who would then feel the shadowy presence shift. Suddenly, instantly, it was close. Ellesandra and the rear guard stood where the ground leveled out after a lazy incline coming up from the city. The secured clearing was behind the rear guard, with a road running north-south past the city that joined perpendicularly with the road leading from the city. The T-shaped intersection of the wider, main dirt road and thinner road to the city was where the guard was stationed; the treeline was a handful of meters beyond the edge of the main road. And from the thin road, the one to the city, the shadowy presence encroached. It would not be long before it was revealed: The pirate captain himself, clad in a long black cloak that was open in front to reveal a bare, hairy chest soaked in blood, along with a feather-adorned black hat, sturdy black bottoms and heavy black boots. A single scimitar in one hand, and an eyepatch over one of his steely grey eyes that stared at the guardsman with contempt; his lips held a mocking grin behind the fuzz of his scraggly, long beard. The captain was flanked by four other men who looked to be pirates of some experience. "Right then boys, which one of these pointy eared fuckers you reckon killed me first mate, eh?" announced the captain as he walked, casually, up to the peak of the road to step onto level ground with the guard. Naturally, the guardsman were immediate in their response, forming a defensive line with a wide berth. They were there to fight to the death to defend the healers, but they relied on the first strike to come from the hidden rangers in the trees. Given the open hostility to these pirates, the hidden rangers did not hesitate. Two arrows flew straight and true at the captain the moment a shot was lined up. Yet as commendable as their alert attention to threats was, the captain responded with a thrust of his free hand forward. A magical pulse boomed from his presence, sending a forcible rush of air ahead of him; the arrows destined for his skull glowed with mana as they were sent flying back to their origin, striking each of the hidden rangers who fired them. Two dull thuds into the grass made clear that the arrows struck true, hurting or killing the hidden guardsman. With that, the captain smirked in this moment, sizing up the guards that stood between him and the healers in the back. The chaos, the roar of battle, resumed in the city. It was the moment before battle; Ellesandra could remain passive and wait for another to strike first, or she could lead the charge, or perhaps try to talk it out if she was so inclined. But the source of the shadow-presence in this area was clear: The captain was bathed in it, whatever it was. A dark, malevolent presence. Yet it wasn't as strong as the one Ellesandra encountered in their dream. It was an echo of it. A fraction of the presence. A part of it, but not the true self of the presence. Perhaps touched by the presence, or commanded by it. Its nature was difficult to discern, but the hatred that suffused it was undeniable. That the captain would kill them all unless stopped by force of words or blades, there was no doubt.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The moment that she suddenly felt the shadow closer, Ellesandra froze. She felt the caution and paranoia turn into concern for Star, but the shadow was still on the road; not in the encampment. Ellesandra's hand was on her rapier as she walked forward, giving away to the elven guards around her that something was wrong before they'd even seen the captain. When the captain appeared, Ellesandra felt her stomach turn. It was him, with the shadow. Was the shadow a creature attached to him, some sort of possession? Or some sort of cursed, magical artifact he was using? She eyed the shadow cloak he had, wondering if that was what it was, not moving as he shouted out about someone killing his first mate. She'd hoped the arrows sent would take care of him, but of course that would be too easy. She watched as him and his probably handpicked pirates stood across from the guards. Based on his magic, the rear guard were likely no match for him as a group. The other pirates certainly, but he would sew enough chaos that they would suffer heavy losses. Not to mention, Star had mentioned he was quite nasty, hadn't she? Taking a deep breath and steeling herself, Ellesandra stepped forward, to the side of the rear guard soldiers to ensure that if the captain used any magic as an attack rather than talking, she didn't have to worry about them getting hit by it too. "That would by myself. Unfortunately, your first mate was a little unwilling to let an unfortunate hostage go. Perhaps you would be smarter than him and retreat now? Unless you'd also like to have my rapier through your heart." It was a goad, to get him to turn to her or send one his men after her. Either way, she wanted to even the odds for the soldiers. She would prefer if he came after her, with her ability to potentially redirect his magic or counteract it, but she'd take whatever she could get. The elven soldiers had suffered enough at this man's hands, likely. The thuds that had resulted from the redirected arrows were proof of that. Still, Ellesandra hadn't drawn her rapier, left hand simply resting on it's hilt, body loose and ready to fight. She'd dueled plenty of times, and she'd also fought against bad odds before, too. She had the scars to prove it; and she wouldn't let him or his shadow get into the rear encampment where Star was.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra's words proved effective towards their goal. The captain rolled his shoulders. "Well then, I thank ye for making the search an easy one!" proclaimed the captain in his deep voice thick as the mud that clung to his boots. "Keep the knife ears busy, lads, leave the runt to me," he barked. The pirates around him then rushed forward to engage with the rear guard. Metal met metal as the fighting began with them, and while they rushed to meet each other, the captain approached Ellesandra who had purposefully put themselves off to the side. Goading the pirate was as easy as ever, it seemed. But that he was looking for a fight hardly was in question. As he walked towards Ellesandra, his imposing six-foot-four, muscle-bound figure carried the shadowy presence all around him. Its source was difficult to place. Attempts to focus on it were met with an elusive, guileful magic veil. As he drew closer, his free hand weaved magic, then thrust forward towards Ellesandra. The effect of the magic struck the knight instantly, though how effective it would be remained to be seen; the magic was that of the spell Compelled Duel, which if it succeeded in affecting Ellesandra would ensure it would be difficult for them to run away, and magically compel them to be unable to attack anyone but the pirate captain himself. Not that Ellesandra likely intended on doing so anyway, but the captain seemed quite intent on fighting the knight one-on-one to exact his vengeance. He also, clearly, had no idea what abilities Ellesandra had, given that he was pleased to throw a magical, targeted spell at her expecting it to work. Though depending on how versed Ellesandra was with magic, she might find his ability to cast that specific spell...Odd. It wasn't every day one encountered a pirate able to use magic, let alone a spell usually employed only by righteous paladins.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced at the elven soldiers when the captain ordered his men to attack them. Well, that was best case scenario for her. She got to fight the magic wielder and not have to worry about his henchmen, while the guards wouldn't have to worry about the captain. She didn't gave away that she was pleased with this turn of events, though, turning to eye the man approaching her. Slowly, she drew her rapier and held it out in front of her, setting herself in a battle stance. When he shoved his hand forward to cast at her, she smirked. The magic poured into her mind, and then spread throughout her body. While most people would immediately feel the full effect of the spell and the need to fight, it didn't effect Ellesandra the same way. There was no visible sign if the spell had any effect, nothing to throw him off his guard that all that really happened was she was more inclined to fight him than before. It wasn't like the spell 'failed', per say. It hit it's mark, and Ellesandra wanted to fight him more than she had before; not that the spell had been needed to make her want to do so rather than running. No, while she would still be able to run, she was less likely to do so; it would require more of a drastic situation than normal to make her decide to flee. But what the spell also did was fuel her mana reserves, and as it settled in, Ellesandra made the same signs with her right hand that she had when she first encountered Star. She'd ensured that there was enough distance between the captain and herself that she could get her defenses prepped, unless he was able to move and attack much faster than she'd expected. The haste spell settled in around her, a light yellow glow, which immediately made her second spell casting faster. While the light yellow glow soon settled into her skin to be very subtle, a more evident blue glow surrounded her form. A magical shield, one that would help her absorb and deflect incoming magical attacks. With the spells in place, Ellesandra eyed the man and prepared her defense. Unlike the other pirates she'd faced, she had to assume this man knew how to fight well - and dirty. So she would keep her eye out, and play defensive at first. Get the feel for how he fought, and use her speed and dexterity to slip in for a hit when he let his guard down.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain didn't seem to realize that something was amiss. He was getting his duel. It was just a little less...Compelled than it was voluntary. With that set, he let loose a chuckle at seeing the rapier. "Ol' Salteye was put down by that pointy stick, was 'e? Pathetic excuse fer a first mate," he muttered to himself, then dipped his hand into the pocket of his cloak, pulling out a ceramic sphere of some sort. He opened the fight by throwing this sphere at Ellesandra's feet, where it exploded and sent out jagged, rusty nails in all directions. Some even flying back to hit him, though they bounced off some unseen force and landed on the ground in front of him instead of hurting him. The blast itself was concussive enough to stagger, but the damage was far more likely to come from the shrapnel of metal and ceramic. But he didn't charge in blindly. He waited to see what Ellesandra did in response, keeping distance enough between them as he opened the fight to give him time to react to Ellesandra's counter. Or, well, what he assumed was enough, not knowing that speed was one of Ellesandra's greater strengths.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was good she'd taken the defensive, then, because if she'd been in motion to attack she wouldn't have been able to avoid the apparent grenade of shrapnel. Ellesandra had started moving as soon as she'd seen the item coming at her, not sure if it was magical in nature or not and what it might do. This put her out of the main concussive part of the blast, having circled around to the side quickly so that it only caused her to take a step back, but it didn't get her completely clear of the shrapnel. While her armor blocked a good amount, the tings seeming to pop off of the magically enchanted plate, Ellesandra gave up protection in some areas for ease of movement. One piece of shrapnel slammed into her left thigh, cutting deep into it, and another into the area just above her right elbow. This one was lucky, both that it was her right arm, and also because that arm had been thrown in front of her face, as the shrapnel otherwise would have hit hit her in the face instead. She quickly recovered, feeling the pain of both hits but neither of them debilitating by any means. Pushing off of the ground with her good leg, she shot forward quickly, rapier ahead of her to feint an attack at the Captain, and then to quickly withdraw and attack again. Ellesandra wasn't going for a killing blow, not expecting to be able to end the captain easily at all, but would take whatever openings he gave her. A cut to his arm, a slash across his thigh, or wherever he left open in her feint, careful not to commit to any attack in case he had his own magical protection or quick response and she needed to dance out of the way or move again to prevent getting hit herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain wore a wide smirk as the grenade went off and scored some hits. Then, he watched with his one eye as the knight encroached. The feint was successful, drawing the man to try to knock the blade away with the flat of his scimitar, only to have the draw-back and quick follow up score a clean strike across his arm. The cloak tore, and the slash left its mark on his arm to pour fresh crimson from the wound. Not terribly deep, and the man's arms were thick enough with muscle that it was unlikely to impede him to any significant degree. The swift strikes that followed earned another strike on his thigh and another at his side. The man was slow, but burly. The cuts were hitting, but he didn't cry out in pain or even grunt, as if the strikes had no effect. Of course, the effect was clear. He was bleeding. He just had a strong constitution. But with a low growl, the captain threw his blade-bearing arm out and upward, his eye aglow with red mana; in the wake of his wild swing at nothing came a forward rush of thunderous force; the magic of a Thunderwave that came out suddenly to blast Ellesandra back and leave their ears ringing. Whether or not her shield could absorb this or if she had the strength of balance to avoid being flung onto her back from it remained to be seen. This was certainly no ordinary pirate captain, regardless.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The hits scored were good; she was more than happy to wittle him down. Taking on someone who was obviously as physically strong as him one on one for a quick hit wasn't going to work; not with how small and physically weak Ellesandra was compared to him. While she had muscle, her right arm was all but useless under heavy weight, and she had no chance to compete with someone of his size in strength. Ellesandra didn't even try to move out of the way as she saw the red mana glow in his eye though, smiling. The thunder wave caused her to skid back about a foot and the force knocked the breath from her, but beyond that it's effect on her was not what the Captain surely expected. The magic slammed into Ellesandra - but not through her. The effect of it knocking her back was obviously reduced, the physical force being absorbed into her mana and shield, but what came after was Ellesandra's right hand waving back at the Captain as the magic that did get absorbed was sent right back out in his direction. Not being a targeted spell, it wasn't something that she aimed at him, but more in his general area. The effect was significantly reduced; probably only enough to make him take a step back if it took him by surprise, but Ellesandra was following up immediately afterwards with her rapier, looking to take advantage of this. The downside of redirecting area spells was that, as all redirects were about half as strong upon the return, area spells were significantly even less because the only bit that Ellesandra absorbed of the area spell was the bit that hit her. The positive, in this situation, was it was likely to take an enemy by surprise. Ellesandra herself felt the wear in her body from the redirect. It wasn't easy to do, or light on her to do so - and the more powerful the magic, the more it effected her. There was a limit to how much she could absorb, which is where her magical shield came in to help deflect the remaining bit. But if a spell was too powerful and Ellesandra tried to absorb or redirect it, it was still liable to punch straight through her resistance and seriously injure her - and even if not, the forced flow of magic that was not hers through her body was a quick way to wear her magically out. So when Ellesandra stepped forward with the rapier, looking to take advantage of the surprise, she aimed at places that would have a serious impact. She doubted he'd be taken so off guard to go for a killing strike, but one placed in the crook of his elbow, or his underarm where it would limit his arm movement and cause continued pain if he swung his sword? Those were her targets.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The captain initially smiled upon seeing the knight sent back a few feet, and took a step in to capitalize on that, only to have the magic indeed catching him off guard in thinking he had the advantage. The result being that the counter wave that hit him knocked him off balance, enough to make that step forward turn into a swift step back to keep him from toppling over. He was wide open for a moment, but swift enough to regain his composure that he could get a last-minute reaction to impact the knight's advance. So it was, her target for his elbow struck true. Their blade struck swift and whether slash or thrust was true enough to strike to the bone. A solid hit. And yet, the captain remained unfazed. No lethargy or impedance could be observed in his motions as he gave a few swings with his scimitar mostly aimed at forcing Ellesandra back, for staying close while he swung would invite his experienced hand to trade blow for blow and give the knight a wound of their own. To play smart and patient demanded they step back, but if Ellesandra continued to aggress, then they would certainly suffer a slash across an unarmored part of their frame for whatever aggression they sought to impose. With his elbow liberally leaking blood, it was either a feat of constitution on par with a raging barbarian, or something else that kept him from showing the effects. Perhaps time was all it needed. For the moment, the captain was growing increasingly impatient with this dance, and took this moment to fish into his pocket with his free hand again. Last time it was a bomb. This time, his hand flew from his pocket with a fist full of some glittering dust, and as he released it towards Ellesandra it exploded into golden, blinding light. Magical in nature, certainly, for the purposes of Ellesandra's resistance. The strategy was clearly to blind Ellesandra, continuing to fight as dirty as possible, if only for a moment. The goal? The captain charged forward, arms out, to throw himself at the woman and attempt to grapple her, using his superior strength to tackle the woman to the ground and pin them under all three-hundred pounds of the dirty, muscle-bound man that he was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was dismayed that her strike into the bone of his elbow hardly fazed him at all. The first few swings were easily dodged, her haste helping her to pull away and disengage, suffering only a minor cut to her left arm that she'd barely missed dodging. She didn't push her luck fighting in again, instead dropping back with the plan of looking for another opening. It had become obvious that something was fueling this man beyond what would be considered the normal; whether this was magic or simple physical constitution Ellesandra didn't know. What she had surmised was that she did need to go for a killing blow; wearing him down over time wouldn't work. That, or simply stalling until the elves had dealt with his men, and could wittle him down from all sides. Unfortunately, with her haste spell and the fact she'd already redirected an AOE spell, that wouldn't work for her. The lethargy that would hit her when her spell ended would be more than enough to spell her death, most likely. This is normally when she would consider leading him away from others, then escaping, all while looking for an opportunity for a killing blow. It was also where the Compelled Duel discouraged it. While still possible for her to decide to lead him away, the magic worked against that thought. And thus, when he decided to make his next move, Ellesandra wasn't quite as far away from him in her stance as she normally would have been. Seeing him reach into his pocket, she'd prepared to move, backing up to create distance, and then seeing him throw something she'd covered her eyes and ducked, expecting and preparing herself to defend against another bomb. It wasn't that though; this time it was a blinding light that exploded. The thing about magic like this, was it wasn't the magic that hurt her. There was no force hitting her; there was simply light. While the light was magical in nature, it was the brightness of it that hurt her, not the light itself as if she were a vampire, so her resistance had been minimal use against it. Her saving grace was that she'd pulled back enough and prepared, covering her face, so she wasn't completely blinded, but she had definitely been dazed. Dazed enough that she hadn't been able to dodge out of the way when he suddenly appeared through the light, charging forward to grappled her. She had, however, recovered enough to make her own response to it. She raised her rapier, it glowing golden itself briefly so that it was empowered to pierce through solid stone and letting the man skewer himself if he continued just like the First mate had done, but considering how he ignored his previous wounds she hadn't stopped there. Her right hand had reached behind her, grabbing the dagger tucked beneath her armored skirt, and raising her hand up so that when he slammed into her and knocked her down, her arm wasn't stuck beneath her. The impact hurt, a lot. Her breath left her lungs and she heard a rib groan - had it cracked? - at the weight of the man pinning her body down. Her armor helped prevent any major crushing for a moment, but it wouldn't last long if he decided to start wailing on her. Her right hand had been held above though, dagger still in it, and as soon as she recovered from the brief shock and staggering her mind went through from the blow, she turned and used all the force left in her weakened right arm to slam the dagger towards the man's head; aiming for his ear or his eye, depending on how he positioned himself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The back and forth was coming to a head. Trading blows was getting neither side any significant ground, not for lack of trying on Ellesandra's part. A deadlocked fight that could go on for hours or until Ellesandra's haste ran out. Unfortunately, it seemed the fight with the elves and other pirates was similarly deadlocked. Both sides were looking worn, but the fighting continued. The chaos from the city kept up as well. All this was the backdrop for the captain toppling Ellesandra and mounting her. The captain jumped on Ellesandra's rapier, letting it skewer him through the lower chest. A punctured lung was his, certainly, as the rapier pushed straight through him and out the other side. But where the first mate had tensed and locked up at that trauma, the captain showed furtherance to his inhuman constitution as he continued as if he was entirely uninjured. He dropped his sword and moved his fat-fingered hands around Ellesandra's neck as they fell to the ground, immediately squeezing in and attempting to choke the life from the knight. Then, the dagger came. His muscly arms being directly down on Ellesandra's neck made it the easier strike to go for the ear and drive the dagger into his brain. And he hadn't the reaction time to block her. So the dagger struck true, straight into his ear, straight through into his brain. And that should have been the end of it. He should have spasmed and fell on her, gross as his blood-and-sweat-soaked, shirtless self was. He should have. But he didn't. The metal blade was jammed clean into his head. The resistance of bone was felt and passed. The dagger was in his brain. And yet...He kept squeezing, with strain showing on his face as he exerted his muscles to try and crush Ellesandra's neck. But of course, Ellesandra wasn't alone in this fight. They never were. And seeing the dire state of the knight, there was someone who was certain to throw caution to the wind and meddle. "Leave her ALONE!" came a cry from a familiar voice, one that was choking back a sob. Then, a surge of mana blossomed from the source of the voice. Intense, powerful mana. Star was standing just within Ellesandra's vision beyond the pirate captain. Ellesandra had seen Star's aura before briefly. A soft, blue glow that had a wispy, airy quality to it. Fluid like water, flowed around her like smoke. But in this moment, it was a brilliant, radiant aura that blossomed well beyond her body. The ground around Star cracked and splintered as if bolts of lightning shot out from her feet through the soft earth, leaving scars of brilliant blue out from all around her as a deafening boom of mana exploded from her. Star's eyes shone aglow with bright blue energy, wholly suffused with mana as she put all she had into this moment. She thrust her hands forward at the pirate captain, and at her mystic command, the captain was wrest away from Ellesandra in an instant, pulled up to a standing posture, arms throw to the side and head cocked to the side; a square of mana formed under him, with a diamond inside that square, and spectral, ethereal chains of mana shot up from the four corners of the square. It was a familiar sight to one familiar with the magic, the spell Hold Person, which paralyzed and trapped the pirate in place, separating from Ellesandra. Star was holding the man in place. Her power was palpable; the magic in the air crackled, free to be absorbed in its bountiful, nigh endless quantity. Blood began to drip from Star's nose as she held this; she grit her teeth and bared it, locking the pirate in place. "Kill him! End this, Ellesandra!" she cried to her companion. A request easier said than done, surely. If the dagger in his brain hadn't killed him, what hope was there in ending this man? A thought that surely might possess Ellesandra, only for the shadowy essence that the knight had felt to converge in once place upon the man. His heart. Mana was building within it, ready to burst and free the man from the spell, breaking him free to continue his campaign of carnage. But in so doing, exposed the source of his power. Ellesandra had but one moment to strike, but the answer, the true weakness of the pirate, was exposed before the knight. It required only that the knight put everything they had into one final strike.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was lucky he didn't just crush her neck, considering his potential strength. The air had already escaped her lungs from him tackling her, so it was on her attempted intake of breath afterwards that she was immediately blocked from doing so. It hadn't stopped her from stabbing him in the ear, which she had expected to cause him to freeze, loosen his hold, and then topple over or on top of her, at worst. In none of her expectations did he just ignore a damn dagger into his brain. She didn't have time to be shocked, as once she realized the attack didn't kill him she was reaching to try to pry a fingerway from her neck, just enough leverage to try to get a breath in at least, struggling with the obviously stronger opponent. Her vision had begun to blur, blackening on the edges, when she heard Star. Her head snapped to the side to look at her at the shout, then she began gasping as his hold suddenly loosened and he stood, becoming paralyzed in the process. She saw the chains wrapping around him and felt the thickness of Star's magic around her, but she didn't pull on it. How much energy had Star already expended in the healing of soldiers, and then this spell? No, but she did reach for her rapier, still in the man's lung, and ripped it out. The rapier still held the light yellow glow about it, strengthened to pierce through almost any armor or even through a wall, intended to ensure he didn't have any magical defense that would shrug it off, and her eyes focused on where she felt that shadow coalesce. Her breathing was ragged and it took a moment for her to focus her aim as well as drawing in large breaths, but with the last of her strength she stepped forward and thrust with her rapier, allowing the blade to pierce straight through his heart. She quickly released after striking, however, and stumbled back, falling on her ass with a wince at the pain that shot through her rib - okay, he had definitely cracked one of her ribs when landing on her, at least. The real reason for the stumble, though, was her haste spell ending. Between the blows she'd taken and the lack of air, her concentration on it had been slipping. She'd forced herself to hang on long enough for the last strike, but now as it was ending she felt like her muscles had just gone through a full day's worth of strenuous exercise. Her body ached and was sore all over, with large bruising marks around her neck and she was sure bruising on her right ribs beneath her armor, and she was still gasping for air - her airway finally starting to be able to take in air normally again and not just in a gasping, weak strangled way. She hoped that strike would kill him, because she didn't know if she had another left in her. And damnit, she'd never had someone keep fighting after she stabbed them in the head. What the hell was that?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The blade retreating from the man's torso saw blood pour out. The man bled, like any other. But nothing stopped him, it seemed. Until, of course, the rapier pierced through his heart. Or...Where his heart would be. For Ellesandra's blade did not find flesh at his core, but rather something hard. Not hard enough to resist the bite of the rapier, of course. Whatever hard thing was there in place of his heart cracked under the piercing force and the rapier sailed clean through. It was then, and only then, that the man showed any pain. The spell holding him in place broke, not because Star lost her grip on him, but because the moment the blade pierced him there, he died. His breath hitched, his eyes rolled back, and blood poured out of his lips. The shadowy essence fizzled, then burst, scattered away and leaving Ellesandra's senses entirely. It was gone, now. And with that strike, the pirate fell to his knees, then became coated in a black energy, and crumbled to ash soon after, leaving nothing in his wake but a pile of ash that was once the man himself, and a small, spherical gemstone amidst the pile that had a pierced hole clean through it in the shape of Ellesandra's rapier. The gem was intact despite the hole through the center; it was large enough to take this strike and not split in two, though was still only slightly larger than the circle made by a pinched thumb and index finger would make. Easily fit in the palm of one's hand. Something that cemented the man as not human at all, or at least...No longer human, once that energy imbued him. But what was more? The other pirates reacted to the death of their captain. They looked dazed. Lost. Like they had been snapped out of something. Of course, that drop in their guard was swiftly met by death blows from the other guardsman. Star then rushed to Ellesandra's side, her eyes returning to their normal pretty blue irises. She knelt beside Ellesandra, hands ready to reach out to touch Ellesandra and heal them the way only she could, but...She stopped herself. Ellesandra's words echoed in her mind. She looked at the knight, blood dripping from her nose. "...Please, Ellesandra. Let me heal you." Despite the stubbornness she had shown before...Seemed she was heeding the knight's demand that she be given permission, at least in a moment where that was an option. Tears were forming in her eyes, and her hands shook. Star was rattled, but she was unharmed. She had a lot of power at her beck and call in the moment, the only question being how exhausted Star would be in the aftermath. What price she would pay for healing the knight in this moment. And in the moments where Star awaited an answer, the chaos of the city died, replaced by a unanimous cheer of victory from below, echoed by the guardsman nearby as their weapons raised, standing victorious over the corpses of the pirate threat.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra sat on her ass, looking up at the man after he seemed to completely freeze - and then turn to ash? Ellesandra frowned, watching her dagger fall as he turned to ash, and the ash and some sort of gem settle on the ground after. "Th..the hell?" Ellesandra had defeated created and monsters before, but none that just turned to ash. They were all flesh and blood of some kind, which was why she'd felt so betrayed at how her dagger in his damn brain didn't do anything to slow him down. Her voice had come out raspy, the choked sound of a damaged wind pipe, and she blinked, turning to look at Star afterwards. Ellesandra was dazed, and a bit in shock. Her eyes turned from the remains of the creature, up to Star who seemed to hover over her and say something, then over to the pirates who had just, stopped fighting. And then they were slaughtered. She frowned, a touch of pity for them. Had they been mind controlled, or otherwise influenced somehow? If that was the case, did they need to have been cut down like that? She blinked, realizing she'd gotten distracted from Star and looked back up at Star. Her eyes turned to the shaking hands, and then up to the teary eyes. "Stop that." She ordered in a gruff, grumpy tone. Her hand came up to take Star's, squeezing it lightly in reassurance, before letting go and flicking her hands away from Ellesandra's body. "I've be-" She paused, coughing, then cleared her throat with a wince and spoke again. "been through worse. Mundane healing should..." A deep breath was taken in as she had moved to try to stand. Yep, definitely damaged a rib. Broken or fractured, she wasn't sure, but it hurt like a sonuva. "should work." They knew it didn't sound convincing, considering their stopping and the obvious pain they were in, but the important thing was it wouldn't kill her. And as long as it wouldn't kill her, and the danger was past so she didn't need to protect Star, then she could deal with the slower, mundane healing that would come with it. She did, however, hold her hand up, requesting assistance in standing up. Star pulling her up would help relieve some of the pressure from her rib when she pushed herself up. The emotions through her were mostly relief, that Star was fine and that she herself survived it, confusion and irritation that stabbing him in the brain had done nothing and at herself for getting put in that situation, and concern for the rest of the injured.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's reaction was naturally an emotional one. The contact of touching Star's hand was brief. Reassuring as it was, and brief as it was, it didn't stop a tidal wave of worry, concern, fear, and a bundle of associated emotions from pouring into Ellesandra. Something that flooded them with a magical force that overwhelmed any attempted barrier to be put up, which had the side effect of proving that the ability to separate the two was at least in part intentional on Star's part for every other time they touched. There was no holding it back this time. A momentary connection that would allow Ellesandra to know, without a shadow of a doubt, the depths of concern Star had for them. For how scared she had been, and continued to be, for the knight. As well, a healthy dose of frustration at Ellesandra's resistance to the matter. She did help them up, but the macho reassurance didn't work. She looked possibly more upset. "W-Wh...Why, Ellesandra? Please...I don't want to see you suffering, and I see the way you're flinching! There's gotta be some internal damage!" Despite her protests, she was still asking permission, rather than forcing herself on them. For now, at least. As she protested, the soldiers began to work on the post-battle actions. There were corpses to remove from the city, and discussions to be had with the local lord if they were present. As well, the black, spherical, broken gemstone was still on the ground in the pile of ash left by the late pirate captain.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The overflowing of emotions, the concern and fear for Ellesandra, hit her like a brick. She paused, the barrier between herself and Star having crumpled at the touch. It made her hesitate to take Star's hand to help stand, but she honestly needed it so she did it anyways, flinching at the overwhelming feeling of how much Star was concerned for her. "How do you even feel that much?" The question was rhetorical, not even meant for Star to hear. Star was so full of emotion, and right now it was all concern for Ellesandra and she didn't know how to handle that. Star was feeling more concern right now than Ellesandra had let herself feel anything for the year before meeting Star. Once she was standing she moved her hand to lightly support her right ribs. It was hard to do through her armor, which she'd need to remove in a bit to actually tend to her wound, but the instinctive motion to grip her side didn't matter if the armor was there. "Help me to somewhere to sit." She motioned to the encampment around the other healers, glancing again at the ashes and stopping, grumbling and moving to kick at the gem with her foot. Did she trust picking it up? She didn't sense the shadow being from it anymore, though that didn't mean it wasn't still cursed in some way, shape or form. She definitely didn't trust Star picking it up though, so taking her rapier she speared through the hole she'd already made and tilted the sword up, letting the gem fall down the sword length and just hit the hilt. Using her other hand, covered in gauntlet to prevent skin to potential magical artifact touching, she pulled it off the blade and put it in a pocket. Then, she sheathed her sword and motioned to her dagger. "And would you pick that up for me? I suspect bending over would hurt." She had ignored the question at first, but after making the requests her eyes turned to Star and watched her for a few moments. "And because I can handle the pain. I'm sure you can too, but I'm not dying, Star. I won't let you feel my pain for me anytime I'm injured just because you can. At most, depending on how bad my rib is, I'll let you use some mundane healing to force enough heal in to mend the bone if it's broken. But not the entire wound itself, and not your sympathetic healing or whatever you called it." Her voice was still raspy, but had become more steady now that she'd been getting air consistently. It would probably be raspy for the next few days while it recovered, but hopefully it wouldn't cause any longterm injury.

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star heard the question, and it was enough to sober her slightly. She was in an overwhelmed state. Her emotion was intense, but a response from Ellesandra that bordered on humour was something that gave an instinctual reminder that Ellesandra wasn't dying. The crisis had passed. The storm had quieted. Star's aura receded more, becoming only slightly more prominent than usual. One could only wonder how powerful the emotion was when it had caused her mana to overflow and create the lingering scorch marks on the dirt; a blackened circle with lightning-like arms stretching in all directions remained where she had been standing. A testament to Star's potential, though even if Star had showcased unique powers thus far, unique did not necessarily equate to powerful. The moment she had intervened and saved Ellesandra from the captain, however? That had been power enough to face the entire army of pirate, surely. Yet, it had not been harnessed. All things that the knight might consider when a broken rib wasn't a far more pressing concern. Star observed the gem, but she was too focused on her companion to really ask questions about it. She bent over to take the dagger as requested and handed it to Ellesandra before supporting them by wrapping her arm around the shorter woman's back, mindful to not hold too tight and put pressure on their chest. She looked disappointed and worried to hear that the knight didn't permit her to take the injuries herself, placated only by the notion that they would permit her to mend the bone, at least. "It is broken," she asserted as fact. "It needs attention, or it may not set correctly and impede your ability to fight. We should be trying to return you to your prime and see if we can restore the strength in your right arm, not giving you another lasting injury to slow you down." She refrained from making a pointed remark about Ellesandra's ego, here. Why did all the proud fighters have to wear wounds like badges of honour? "Part of protecting me is ensuring you are keeping yourself in peak fighting condition, wouldn't you agree?" she said as they reached the secured clearing, so she could ease Ellesandra down on a wooden log that had been conjured to sit on like a bench. There were padded bedrolls laid out to rest on if Ellesandra preferred to lay down. Star had seemed to calm herself at this point; the contact steadily became more separated until the barrier between emotions solidified once more. Star was still dripping blood from her nose, though that too had slowed. Her frame was still slightly shaking, but that too had been subsiding. She looked at the other healers doing their work. There were still more injured, and the last trickle of wounded were arriving from the fight in the city. Star looked like she was going to call some of the others over to heal Ellesandra, but...A mental calculation dissuaded her from doing so. Perhaps she thought their skills were better used on their own, given how much more it would take to tend to the knight. Regardless, she placed a hand on Ellesandra's neck. Her hand then shone aglow with white light, and she showed strain in her face as healing energies poured into Ellesandra. Her hand trembled, but she forced through this. Two minutes of concentration later, and her hand eventually fell off Ellesandra's neck, with sweat pooled on her brow. Exhaustion was more than obvious; this effort had renewed the bleeding from her nose to a steady drip. But for her efforts, the magic had forced itself through Ellesandra's wards enough to set the bone in their ribs and mend it. It was still tender; the surrounding muscle was beyond her capacity in the moment to heal, so bruising and some small internal bleeding was left untreated. The other cuts were also left without treatment, and Star was plainly beyond tapped out, pushing into reserves even greater than her last exertion with her shimmering armor. She'd done enough to ensure no lasting damage was done, and this time it seemed it wouldn't take Ellesandra admonishing her to get her to stop. She hit a limit that certainly wouldn't cause any lasting harm, but...Despite her unfaltering spirit, she had hit the limit of what her body could safely take. Exhausted, she sat on the log beside Ellesandra, chest slightly heaving. Eyes shut. Sweating and hot on the forehead. Bloody nose slowly clotting. She was a mess. And yet...She smiled. It hadn't been a victory without cost. But it was, still, victory. Evil had lost on this day, and Lissana might yet breathe a heavy sigh of relief when the news reached them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't come around enough to notice the black marks, not until they had started walking by them. She had taken the knife and slid it back into it's sheath beneath her armored skirt, right up against her leggings. She was bleeding from a spot in her thigh and arm, as well as the bruising around her throat and likely on her rib. Now that the adrenaline had mostly gone, she was feeling the pain and winced a bit more at it. The touch from Star, to help her along, was almost refused - not because she didn't need the help, but because touching Star was overwhelming right now. Even with her barrier the concern was pouring through, at least at that moment, and she didn't like how much of it she felt. As they passed by the scarred land, Ellesandra looked down at it in surprise, but didn't comment on it. She also glanced over to the soldiers, to confirm they hadn't been completely wiped out and were at least faring better than maybe she was. Still, she hdidn't say anything until she was brought into the healer's tent and to a makeshift bench, sitting down with a sigh of relief, leaning her head back and pressing back into the bench with one hand on her side. She needed to get her armor off soon, so it wasn't bothering the wound. Only after the danger was confirmed over, though. "How do you know it's broken?" She asked, in regards to Star asserting it. Oh, it probably was. With the way it hurt, she was just lucky she didn't feel in pain in her lung or trouble breathing, meaning the broken bone hadn't gone into her lung. Her armor had really done wonders in helping take some of that man's heavy form. "I'm not saying you're not allowed to heal, just the bare minimum, Star." Just enough that it could heal properly on it's own. The rest could be mended with mundane means, without Star exhausting herself or taking the pain on herself. Feeling Star place a hand on her neck made her jerk, surprised at it's placement. She wasn't about to heal the throat injury, was she? But no, Ellesandra felt the magic attempting to flow to her rib. She had to actively force her body not to try to absorb the magic, like it naturally wanted to do. She could ensure that she didn't absorb it, though that didn't make it any easier to actually cast into. Her innate resistance was still a thing, and Star would feel like she was trying to shove her magic through a thick, muddy sludge of a body. Ellesandra hadn't been paying attention to Star, which was her bad, because when Star stopped she was obviously exhausted. Ellesandra was breathing better and the pain was definitely lessened, but Star had obviously pushed herself too far. Reaching over, she lightly wiped at the bloody nose to wipe some of the blood off of Star's face, frowning at her. "You went too far." A protest that was useless, since it had already been done. She sighed, leaning back in the chair and looking around at the other healers. She'd recover for a moment before seeing about wrapping her other, more mundane injuries. "I don't think I'm going to be carrying you back this time."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Says the woman who had a broken rib," said Star back, wearing a smile despite the obvious exhaustion in her voice. She looked up at the knight, her eyelids heavy. "...I mean it, though. Me being the sort who is often in the backline, often out of danger...What gives me any right to work any less hard than the people putting everything on the line?" she asked, perhaps rhetorically. She looked out over the other healers. "...I might feel like hell for the next day or two. But I'm still breathing. That's more than I can say for some of the fighters who came here today to do what needed to be done. Don't mistake my words for suggesting I want to take their place, but...There are going to be friends and family who will endure incredible pain when we all return, and their worst fears become reality to know that this morning was the last time they saw their friend or loved one alive." She paused. "...I have no right returning to the company of such people unless I've given every last drop of my strength in the fight. For no matter how much I sacrificed today, they certainly sacrificed more. I will recover. There are some who came today who will not." She again went quiet for a time. She drew in a heavy breath, then lowered her head. "...I always know what other people feel, remember, Ellesandra? It can take time to focus on it but...Your aura knows all that ails you, physically, and emotionally. A touch is all it takes, though...The connection is almost never as automatic as it is with you. I have to...Actively try to separate us, where with most I have to actively try to form that bridge."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She rolled her eyes about the broken rib. It wasn't like she intentionally broke her rib. What choice did she have, let the captain just sweep through the elven guard? Hell, she would have died if it weren't for Star. That feeling settled uneasily in her gut, remembering the man hovering over her with his hands on her neck, knife in his head and not stopping. The surprise she'd felt at that moment when he just...kept going. Fucking hell, it had been a long time since she'd felt fear like that. not since - The flash of emotional pain made her wince and reach down, pressing her thumb against her thigh wound to send a spike of physical pain through her own body. It quickly refocused her thoughts away from where they were and she cursed under her breath, as if she hadn't expected the pain even though she'd done it intentionally. Taking a deep breath she leaned her head back and stared up, at either the sky or the enclosed vines. "It isn't your fault, those others who died. And it's not because you gave any less than they did. So stop that shit, or self-blaming. It isn't healthy." Kettle, meet pot. She knew this in the back of her mind, but didn't comment on it. She also pushed her guards down just a little harder at the idea that Star had to fight to prevent the bridge between them, rather than working to form it with other people. That idea bothered her; if anything, she would very much have liked the choice on whether or not to let Star into her emotions. She didn't currently have that, and the vulnerability of it bothered her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
"I'm not blaming myself," she snapped back, exhausted as she was. "I'm saying I hold myself to the same standard. That if they are willing to die, I'm not content until I've run myself ragged trying to keep them alive. When I face the grieving faces of those who must face the ultimate loss, I need to be able to genuinely tell them I did all I could." Another pause for breath. "...I certainly saved at least a few lives here today. And that's about the only thing that can keep me from actually blaming myself for the ones I couldn't. I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to fight as hard as you do, Ellesandra. That's...All I've been trying to say every time I've begged you to let me help you. But since we're on the topic of telling each other to stop unhealthy habits, I'd be remiss to not mention you jamming your thumb into your womb to repress what you were feeling just then. I'm...Doing my best to respect your privacy on the matter, but I don't know how much self-destruction you expect me to be okay with."  
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra blinked in surprise when Star snapped back at her. Perhaps she had misinterpreted, then. There was no offense taken at the snap, more just surprised the usually polite and kind woman had it in her. A brief reminder to herself they'd known eachother for just a couple of days; plenty to still learn if they wanted to. Ellesandra wasn't sure how much more she wanted to, since Star had already learned more about her than she was comfortable with. Still, she listened to the rest, watching Star silently, until she turned the topic back on her. Ellesandra turned her gaze away, jaw clenching, and a mixture of defensive anger and discomfort rose. She had to fight the anger down not to snap at Star herself; she'd already done that last night, and look how that had turned out. Instead, there was silence for a moment before she pressed her left palm down into the bench and pushed herself up with it, standing with a wince. The rib definitely felt better, but it wasn't like the pain was all gone. Not only that, but the thigh and arm didn't feel great either. She didn't go far, ignoring anything Star said until she located some of the mundane supplies for wounds and brought them back to the bench. She sat, and without a word slid her leggings down enough to begin tending to the new injury on her thigh, like she had the other day. Her lips were pressed together and, while she wasn't really trying to give Star the silent treatment as a punishment per-say, she wanted to make it clear that line of conversation was not open, and pushing at it would just make Ellesandra withdraw - because she would. She had agreed to guard Star; that was all. She had not agreed to be her friend, even if that's how their relationship was going so far. The silence was also a good time to push down that defensive anger, and the bit of shame that was buried deep within it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star watched the other woman silently get up and busy themselves. Star had things she felt strongly about just the same as Ellesandra. A standard to which she held herself. A duty to other people. An overwhelming need to embrace altruism and reject selfish desires within herself. She wasn't physically strong like Ellesandra. And to date she hadn't shown particular prowess at any offensive magic either. Being able to paralyze an opponent certainly was potent, but only assuming there was someone who could deliver the lethal blow waiting nearby. She couldn't guard people like Ellesandra could. So she had to do other things to look out for people around her. It hurt her to see Ellesandra turn silent on her. It hurt her more for that to be triggered by hypocrisy. It already took a mountain (that didn't exist) of patience to not throw herself at Ellesandra and SCREAM at them to stop pushing everything down. But...Star was, if nothing else, patient. Even on the verge of passing out from her exhaustion, she held patience. She took Ellesandra's lead about silence, then took some of the medical supplies for herself. Not to apply to herself, but to tend to other wounds she could see on the knight. Just because they were giving her the silent treatment didn't mean she was going to stop caring about them and their health. It would take a lot more than a stubborn pout to turn off Star's altruistic nature.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra jumped when she felt Star reach for her arm. A glance to the side made it obvious Star was reaching to help tend to the wound, and she sighed. "You're too damn good, Star. Be a bitch back sometimes, it would help." She gave Star a wry smile, before holding her arm out in an angle that helped Star to access the shrapnel wound just above her elbow. She'd been lucky it hadn't hit right in the elbow, because unlike the damn captain who just kept swinging after being struck there, it would have more severely impacted Ellesandra. Would she have been able to bring the dagger into his head if she'd been hit there? Probably not, not that it really mattered anyways. Another wince came, though this time just from the general ache and muscle fatigue that came from her using the haste spell to it's full duration. She could rest for hours, if she let herself. Would the camp rest here, to take care of their wounded? A glance was given around to see what the plan was. "What's the plan for getting back? Or are we going back, or leaving from here to our next destination?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I'll just feel worse if I'm mean to you," she said, offering a sincere smile at Ellesandra. It was true. A little misunderstanding was all it took to make Star bawl her eyes out. "If you need more motivation to ease up, I can always work on my puppy-dog eyes," she added, being as gently playful as she could be with her words given her state. Though the notion of Star somehow looking even more like a kicked puppy when receiving harsh words was a scary one. It already took so little to get her misty-eyed when it was someone she cared about. She worked on what wounds she could, demonstrating a clear skill with medicine, though her motions were slowed considerably by her exhaustion. She was liable to pass out once the adrenaline waned. She already looked a little unsteady now and again. "I'm sure Morrun and Lissana would accept us if we need to go back. But I think the decision is one we should make together. You were the one who demanded I take an extra day and rest...I'll probably need two or three days to get back to full strength after today. But hells if I'll be able to march back there. I'd sooner find an inn in Cloverport to pass out in than even think about marching that distance again. Hell, this log is looking pretty comfy right about now, even. Just hold still until I'm done dressing your wounds, if nothing else."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra just imagined Star giving her puppy eyes and was immediately effected by just the imagination. "Do not ever do that." She said in a serious tone that was much more fear that Star would do it and she'd bend immediately than in actual seriousness about her doing it. She finished bandaging her own thigh, delayed a bit by using only one hand while Star bandaged in her right arm, and then watched as Star finished up her arm. She used her left hand to reposition her leggings back in place, settling back in on the bench and sighing again. "I agree, that march back to the elven settlement would be too much for today. Need to find somewhere to rest now, but I'm not sure an inn in Cloverport will be the best, do you? If there are people who remember us and blame us for the attack at all, or the damage or death caused by it, it might be bad for us in our weakened states. Perhaps you can rest on the bench for a bit while I ask the elven commander what their plan is, and decide from there?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept up until all of Ellesandra's wounds were dressed. Her work was good, even in this state. She knew her way around properly cleaning and dressing a wound. Thankfully none were deep enough to require stitching. Her hands were too shaky to hold a needle still at the moment. She nodded to the plan, though couldn't help a lingering smile at the idea that she could sway Ellesandra with puppy dog eyes. She'd never do so maliciously. She couldn't. But if it was all in good fun, she was perhaps even more inclined to try it, given Ellesandra's response. A little secret for her to keep, though the smile on her face was at least a little bit telling to her inner mischief maker. But, serious topics once more: "Mn, that sounds like a good plan. I'm sure most of the soldiers feel the same, and not just forced march but carrying the wounded I'm sure isn't high on everyone's priorities. Still...I have to wonder. I noticed how the pirates reacted to the captain dying. I have to wonder if there was some magic at play, something that affected the townspeople as well."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited until Star had finished entirely bandaging her, and then moved to stand again. She grit her teeth at the ache in her muscles; yep, she definitely needed some rest. "I don't know, there was the gem that fell out of the captain but...I don't want to bother investigating it until we're both well rested. It's entirely possible it's cursed in some way and I don't want to deal with that in our fatigued state." She looked around, trying to find the rear guard commander. "You lay down and rest. When I have a plan of where we can stay, I'll come get you." She also hoped that she would be able to wake Star, because in her current state she wasn't confident she could lift and carry the mage. As small as Star might be, Ellesandra was weaker than ever right now, and with her right arm being out of commission for lifting things she'd be hard pressed to just fireman carry Star anyways. The mention of Star healing that arm came back to her and she pursed her lips, not liking the idea even if Star had a point. "Will you be okay while I go do that?" She wanted to ask before leaving, and asking also got her mind off of the discomfort with the idea that came up.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft nod. "I've made friends with the healers, I'm sure they'll smack anyone who tries to bother me," she said with a smile. That she made friends was hardly a surprise. She moved to lay on the log and looked to be quite swift in falling into a light sleep. Talking to the captain would reveal the plan was to make camp among the trees when spoken to, and that Ellesandra and Star were more than welcome to join them, that a tent, a fire, and provisions were plentiful, and plans were already being made for a rotating watch to guard the camp. A safe place to rest for the night was theirs, and with Ellesandra bringing the topic up had the captain starting to bark orders at soldiers to begin the preparations for the camp. Bedrolls and communal tents were planned, though the travel food would prove to leave a little to be desired. Military rations were meant to last, not be tasty, after all.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, glancing at said healers at the mention. Now that she was standing her legs were screaming at her. It wasn't pain, per say, but just the absolute fatigue that came with pushing your muscles too far. Taking a deep breath, she confirmed that Star was laying down and alright before she headed off to the commander to inquire about the camp's plans. With confirmation they would be setting up camp nearby, Ellesandra began making her way back to the healer's tent and locating her bag, which she'd placed down after they'd set up camp. The tent was folded up within it, but as she stared at it she realized she really did not have the energy right now to set it up. Instead, she looked over to the healers, and deciding their tent was good enough, she just moved to lay down her bedroll next to the bend Star was laying on. A spare blanket, small but still a fur blanket, was placed over Star's resting form, trying not to wake her. If the healers needed them to move, they'd tell them. Until then, Ellesandra needed just as much rest as Star probably did, and would lay down next to the bench she was sleeping to get it. Food could come later, once her muscles weren't screaming in fatigue.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The healers were naturally the ones in charge of comfort for everyone. So, one came over with a less fatigued soldier and directed Ellesandra to one of the tents that was set up with bedrolls, and had the other soldier carry Star along to something more comfy than a log. Thanks were given to both of them for their efforts along with a deep bow from the healer, allowing the two to rest through the night. Food could come in the morning, more than likely, as fatigue remained the most pressing issue. A communal effort was made to ensure everyone was taken care of, with the remainder of the night being just idle tasks before everyone went to bed. The elves did not sleep; they engaged in reverie, often called 'trance', for just four hours. But Star and Ellesandra would likely need a full eight, perhaps ten or twelve before they were able to wake again. But during the night, Ellesandra was visited again. The scenery was different this time. They were on the pirate ship's deck this time, out in the middle of the ocean. Water in all directions, moonlight sky above, sails fully deployed and riding the wind across the black waves. No other beings on the deck of the ship. Just Ellesandra, and the shadowy black creature. They had no eyes, yet Ellesandra somehow knew the creature was looking at them. They were about ten feet apart. Ellesandra had their rapier and armor, and didn't feel any of the injuries of their waking self. They were lucid, aware of their dream. The shadow figure did not exude malice or a desire to fight, but there was certainly also a sense that fighting this creature was a bad idea, at least in this dreamscape where they seemed to hold all the power. "...Why, Ellesandra?" asked the voice which continued to deny any understanding about its nature. "Why did you not run?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expected that offer. When laying down and the healer offering them to go to the tent, Ellesandra looked at Star in concern. That was quickly answered as one of the other elves moved to carry Star. She felt concern for Star for a moment until she saw Star laid down in the bedroll safe, and then moved to lay nearby. She positioned herself so that she'd be between Star and anyone that would be approaching; not that it would matter, with how deep into sleep she fell. Normally Ellesandra had trained herself to sleep lightly, to wake up at any strange noises and such, but when she was this exhausted and her body so weak after the haste spell, she always slept deeply. It was one reason she hadn't felt entirely comfortable with sleeping in the inn, compared to with the elves. The elves, she at least was allied with and kind of trusted to keep an eye out. Random people in an Inn who might hold a grudge, whether or not they were magicked? Definitely not. When she dreamt again, of the shadowy black creature, Ellesandra immediately reached for her weapon. Even if it wasn't looking hostile, it had been hostile - and Ellesandra was taking up a defensive posture. "Why are you still in my dreams? Is it the gem?" She had worried that the creature might be in the gem. Had sleeping with it in her pocket been a mistake? Either way, she didn't answer it's question. Instead she stayed in the defensive, concern and caution filling her emotions, eyes flicking this way and that to see if anything else was around.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The dreamscape was still just a ship. No other persons. No threats. Not even any waves to speak of. The waters were unnaturally still as the ship sailed through them. The shadowy figure did not react to the defensive posture. "The gem lost its influence when you shattered it. But it also a...Lesser gem," the shadow explained, strangely helpful. "It poses you no harm, now. Though perhaps some magic lingers within it to be discovered. Now I ask, again...Why did you not run? I have shown you that the only thing that awaits you is pain."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was a little surprised at how the shadow just...answered her. A frown creased her face and her right hand reached for her pocket, where the gem had been. Magic still in it? It would need to be examined by someone with more skill in identifying that type of thing; she didn't trust it otherwise. She definitely wasn't just going to take this shadow's word for it. "I'm not going to play your games or answer your questions just because you show up in my dream. After what I saw you encouraging be done with those pirates and in that town, I've no requirement to answer anything." Stubborn she was, not always the most intelligent though.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "If I wanted to force you to answer, force you to bend to me, I would have little trouble. I would think you'd consider not joining the fate of that pirate captain you slayed a mercy. Not that I expect you to take my mercy as a signal that I am your ally. But that I am not your ally does not necessarily mean I am your enemy. I hope at least you can recognize that drawing your blade has no purpose here." With those words, Ellesandra's rapier drew itself and flung across the ship, embedding in the deck far behind the shadow. It then exploded into flowers. This was, after all, a dream. Just not one that Ellesadnra was in control of. "I'm not here to play games. I'm here to talk. But if you'd rather be stubborn and resist, there's no reason I need be civil. The choice is yours, Ellesandra."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra reached for her rapier even as it shot across the ship and into the deck, then turned into....flowers? She blinked a few times in confusion before turning to look back at the shadow. Well, if it was trying to show it had control here, it did. She considered trying to pinch herself to force herself to wake up, but not only did she doubt that would work, it seemed childish. Instead, she took a step back, creating more distance between her and the creature, then crossed her arms tightly. "Fine. We trade questions then. I ask first, then you. Why are you haunting, or visiting or whatever you would call this, Star's guardians?" Obviously there was nothing forcing the creature to answer, but she was hoping that it would accept the back and forth rather than just asking Ellesandra a bunch of questions. It would put them on as close to even ground as Ellesandra might be able to wrangle in this space.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"I certainly wouldn't call it haunting, but you can call it whatever you like. And it is not just Star. But she is certainly one of the persons of interest, yes. The reason for it? Well. It is quite a story to explain in full. The overwhelming majority of it does not concern you. But the part that does? I hope you won't consider the answer insufficient as I tell you that it is...Not as much about Star herself as it is what Star is trying to do. If she, like you, were to abandon the cause and leave, then you would never see me again. I have little hope that you, or I, would ever dissuade her from abandoning her cause. I have succeeded in manufacturing the circumstances to ensure Nina is no longer acting in protection of Star. And you'll forgive me for hoping that my previous entry into your dream, showing you what awaits Star, and showing you that I am all too aware of your past with Marigold, along with the leverage that provides me, would have been enough to make you act rationally, and leave. She will pursue her goal without you, but she will not be able to achieve it alone. She might even live to an old age." The shadow then paused to allow them to take in the information. "So again...I ask...Why did you not run?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She watched the creature, considering. Was it...trying to protect Star? Though it's mention of Marigold sent anger through her, not only at the memory of the previous dream but also at the irritation and pain that the memory brought. And that not only star, but this damn creature could just apparently see right through her. She was tired of not having her normal barriers work. Shifting to let out some of the irritated energy, she shook her head. "Rationally? You pretend you know anything about Marigold, to have her name in your mouth. If you did, you would have known that showing her dying to me, and implying the same would happen if Star continued alone, would only encourage me to stay with her and protect her from that fate." The words were not verbalized, but in her mind she heard them. 'like I couldn't protect Marigold'. She wanted to do it right, this time. She could not let another charge die. If she walked away now, and Star died on her journey, Ellesandra would be at fault - or at least, she would feel like she was at fault.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Really? Because the way I see it, you've done nothing but agonize over your failure. Nothing but insult and push away everyone around you. I saw fit only to give you a gentle shove over the edge and have you see the truth. The pirate captain you faced was a peon. The thralls that serve me could run you through in an instant, ending your life before you ever realized you were under threat. And I say that not as a threat. I say that simply to illustrate to you that the path you walk is one that spells your doom. I would truly prefer that you and Star do live. I mean that. But you meddle in things beyond the scope of your existence. You walk forward to mutual peril. You have encountered me only by chance, and you owe nothing to Star. You won't be able to save her from me if you press onwards to Myst, and then her homeland. While Myst will be a safe place for you, the lands beyond will not be. Gurhal will be your grave." The shadow paused again, once more giving information away. "You are welcome to ask another question, if you are prepared to answer another in turn."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Lips pressed together in a firm line, displeased with what he was saying. It wasn't entirely inaccurate, though she didn't go out of her way to insult people like he implied. Push them away surely, but she mostly did that by just being guarded. Unfortunately, that didn't seem to work with Star. At the promise of how dangerous continuing this path was, she just shook her head. "Again, all you're doing is assuring me that either I stay with Star and convince her not to follow this path, or stay with her to protect her from this mutual peril that we'd both be in. Not doing a good job of convincing me otherwise." She relaxed her crossed arms, only to reach up and scratch at the back of her head when considering another question. Did she have another one, that was worth answering one of its? The creature seemed to be pretty powerful, and already knew about Marigold, so what did she have to hide. "Beyond convincing Star not to follow this path - because we both know that's about as likely as myself becoming as emotional as Star and sharing them with the world - How can I best protect her from you and these perils she faces?" Might as well get straight to the heart of the matter, right? No need to beat around the bush.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"There's no reason to kill Star if she has no guardian to get in the way. Conflict will keep her away, and she will find it at very corner where she walks without you. She will run, perhaps forever, while being infinitely redirected by me. I can't guarantee she will survive, but I can promise I won't be the one to fell her if you leave," said the creature, difficult to determine if it was indifference or some other thing in its warbled tone. The emotion was impossible to discern. "As to your question? You can best protect her by leaving. But to ensure I stay true to the spirit of your question, I will provide another answer." Was the figure lying, or just trying to dissuade Ellesandra further? Could they trust the figure? It was giving a warning where it at least claimed it could end them in an instant, but was holding back. Was that also a bluff? If something stronger than the pirate was sent to Ellesandra and was equally able to take knives to its brain, perhaps it wasn't. But it had made its desires clear. It had every reason to try and get Ellesandra to leave, and little reason to encourage them to stay. "You will not defeat my thralls in combat. You are too mortal. Strong as you are, you are too weak. You have lived but twenty four years. Barely cresting adulthood. My greater thralls, the bearer of the Blood Onyx, the Red Opal, the Blood Emerald." As they spoke, the thralls in question appeared behind them. They each looked at Ellesandra with indifference, though their forms were shadow, like the primary shadow. Each one had a gemstone embedded in their heart, like the captain had. An onyx, an opal, and an emerald, each one tinted red and dripping with blood. Unlike the main shadow, they each had a set of eyes. The first two red, 'emerald' one green eyes. The eyes were solid colours and glowing. "You will not defeat them in battle. And since that is all you know, you will be powerless against them. And if it comes to it, they will take Star by force. Before I ask my question...Does that sufficiently answer yours?"
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked between each of the creatures that the shadow was 'showing' her, trying to take in any details about them she could. Obviously there was very little information, but even just a generic outline might help her recognize one of them in the wild before they started attacking, assuming she couldn't identify the feeling of the shadow ahead of time. It was odd that she'd been able to feel it from the boat, but she didn't want to ask about that or give that information away, unsure if it knew that she could sense it. "Lovely to know your absolute confidence, thank you for that." They weren't going to pretend the 'leaving Star' wasn't a consideration, but it was one she could consider when she was awake, not when she was conversing with this shadow being for now. "If I were a technical person, your question was just asked by confirming it sufficiently answered mine. But I'll play fair and honorable, as Torm would have me do. Yes, that sufficiently answers my question."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You'll find that playing games with me will end poorly for you all the same," said the shadow, still once more with emotions unable to be discerned. "Very well. Then my next question is thus: Why do you believe Star is connected to you? Auramancers have supreme control over their auras. Or at least...A master auramancer does. It should not be that touch alone bridges the connection between you both. Or is it not that you do not think about it, simply that you do not care to consider it? That her ability to see through your careful stoic face bothers you too much to bother with such idle curiosities?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned. So this being obviously knew Star was an auramancer, which was apparently something most people didn't know about. Was it a deity of some kind? Or perhaps just a really powerful demon? She wouldn't be surprised if it was just a deity fucking around in mortal's lives, and huffed silently. "I have no idea why, she mentioned that and it bothers the hell out of me. I'd rather her not be able to see shit. I'm not aware of any connection between the two of us, beyond maybe you appearing in my damn dreams." She paused, tilting her head one way then the other. She never fully looked away from the shadow, keeping it in her sight, but she did look to the side while considering. "Perhaps when she first used magic when I first approached her, and I absorbed some of her energy through my own ability, that bridged it? Because I have some of her energy in me, her auramancy reads it like she's reaching out to something similar, or acts as the bridge for her?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The shadow didn't react to the answer given. "A worthy theory. But her auramantic magic bypasses your absorption. Her more typical mana, that she can use to cast spells more familiar to the typical caster, you have absorbed. But it connects her to you no more or less than it has connected you to every other source of mana that you have absorbed." The shadow then paused. "I remain honourable in my methods. So I will further extend the spirit of the question and ask: Do you wish to knew the truth of this matter? And if so, do you wish for me to explain it, or do you wish to ask Star, knowing she might not know, or might lie? Though I suppose...If you do not leave Star, you will be seeing me again, and may wish to explore one option before the other."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	"What is the purpose of sending me to ask Star only to expect me to ask you again afterwards? If you know the answer and are willing to share, why not just share it rather than ask these silly questions? I care not where the answer comes from, other than knowing I distrust you more than I distrust Star." Which was actually saying something, since while she trusted Star to speak the truth most of the time, she did not trust how her magic worked. It was less about trust in Star and more a dislike to how vulnerable and open she felt against her magic, how she had no control over a firm emotional boundary that she usually drew for everyone to stay away from.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You'll find that I don't ask needless questions. Even if you might not understand the reason initially, it has its purpose. In this case, consider that the answer I have to share may have its consequence. That learning this from me may deprive you of the chance to ask Star instead. You say you care not where the answer comes from, but perhaps you should consider if that is wise. I am not your ally. My words may sow doubt in you. I have proven that I know things most do not. That I know at all what Auramancy is alone proves as much. Yet I know so much more. Things I should not know, in the opinions of many. So it then becomes a question you must ask yourself: Where is your anchor? Unto which pillars of truth do you sow your foundations? Plausibility? Contextual validity? Faith in the source? I present to you the problem you now face, since you are so eager to rush forward without due consideration of it: You may ask Star, and Star alone. I will tell you that Star knows not the full answer. Only the surface of the truth. She will tell you the root cause. She will tell you what her mother told her. She will tell you, perhaps even show you, what causes the two of you specifically to be connected in that way. She may even be able to tell you how rare it is that this phenomenon occurs with others. What she cannot tell you, what she does not know, is why you and her now stand together. And that, Ellesandra...Will prove to be unpalatable knowledge for you, I believe. Knowledge I am happy to provide...For I believe there is a chance it will further my ends, and give you greater cause to depart from Star, and abandon her mission. Knowledge I can assure you is the truth, regardless of how vehemently you choose to doubt it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shook her head. "If the answer is true, then I care not it's source in this moment. Should the answer be something I feel Star should have told me, then that's a conversation I will have with her. Assuming I believe you and you aren't phrasing things in a way to intentionally antagonize me against her, which I'll decide if you are after I heart this. So, stop talking in riddles and answer it." Ellesandra seemed a little impatient and annoyed with the shadow. She didn't like how this creature could apparently just appear in her dreams at will, how much power it might have and that it seemed intent on stopping Star from finishing her mission. Her arms crossed again, glancing around as if seeking a way to escape this conversation or dream. Maybe pinching herself wasn't such a bad idea, after all? Would that wake her though, or just reinforce that this was a dream? She wasn't sure; dream magic was something she wasn't aware of, if this even was dream magic.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "They are hardly riddles, Ellesandra. You are still young, still cresting over your passage into adulthood. One day, you will need to face the reality of the grand multiverse around you, and your place in it. Or don't. You're welcome to remain ignorant. But as for the answer...You and Star have what auramancers call 'resonance'. Auras are a strange and mysterious thing, and there are many points where words will fail to adequately explain them. This is one such time, but...Simply think of it like music. Two harmonies that compliment one another perfectly and sound...Right. Auramancers slowly come to achieve resonance with other people over time, if they remain close, and the bond between them grows strong enough. Though, I speak of this as if there are thousands of auramancers from which to draw such conclusions. No. Their bloodline has been ongoing for but a few short centuries, and what other bloodlines of auramancers I have known have all died. But I digress. This resonance is rare to exist naturally. Extremely so. Perhaps it is just chance, perhaps there is some other quality that creates it. I truly cannot say." A first for the shadow, it seemed. "But the resonance of your auras is something that would typically require a very....Specific emotion to achieve. And even then, it is not guaranteed. That is why Star struggles to control her powers in how they affect you. That she could see your emotions would always be true, but what happens when you touch is where this resonance matters. Which leads me to...The part that Star does not know. The why of it all. The truth of why you were on the road you were on at the exact moment you needed to be. Perhaps you just through it a coincidence. But I'm sure my talking about it clues you into how it was anything but." The shadow stopped here, raising an arm towards Ellesandra. A shimmering light appeared beside Ellesandra. Another figure, this one a coalescence of white light taking the form of a humanoid. Around this figure's neck appeared to be hanging a necklace, with a brilliant sapphire pendant. The necklace was ethereal and made of light as well, so it would take some time to study it to discern that it was supposed to be jewelry, and different from the embedded gemstones of the other shadows behind the one who spoke. "...It was my enemy who guided the circumstances. Who meddled in precisely every necessary event to ensure that you and Star crossed paths and met one another under circumstance that would compel your response. Manipulated you into meeting her, with both of you remaining none the wiser to it, so that all would fall into place, and disrupt my ends. And you have said yourself more than once how you do detest the gods and their meddlesome ways...Even if this white figure beside you, nor I, are gods. Had it not been for this influence, you very well might never had met Star. And thus, never would have been caught up in the war they and I fight. So it is my desire only to persuade you to walk away from this manipulation, return the world to its fated ways."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was getting tired of this creature's way of speaking. It was arrogant and seemed to like to hear itself talk, considering how it kept going on and on without getting to the point. The point being, apparently this other creature with a sapphire pendant was the one who brought them together. This shadow creature's enemy? They looked towards this figure, looking them up and down to take in as much detail about them as possible so if it was anything like how the creature actually looked, they would be able to recognize them upon encountering them. Then, turned back to the shadow and shrugged. "Oh lovely some fate designed connection between Star and I that lets her see into me. That isn't her fault, and damn well isn't mine, as much as I hate her being able to see my emotions so easily." She shook her head. "And why would knowing this strange creature orchestrated us together make me less inclined to continue on my path? You're doing the exact same thing, trying to manipulate me into not continuing. Either I continue and do what this other creature wants, or don't and do what you want. Either way, I'm following the plan of some other asshole. Might as well do what I want and say fuck you to anyone else who might benefit or not from it. Right now, my decisions are my own. Now, if I jump over the side of this ship, will the damn dream end?" She was done talking to this creature. Her head hurt - as much as it could hurt in a dream - and she didn't give a damn about what it was saying.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "You're welcome to view it as such. But consider that one side manipulated you without your knowledge, and I brought forward my intentions honestly. I am stating my intentions, and providing you forewarning of the consequences of your actions. I relegate the freedom to choose to you in turn." The shadow paused a moment. "The dream will not end if you jump. The dream will end when I permit it. Which I will permit promptly once I offer you one last chance to ask a final question of me if you so wish. It will be a few days before you see me again, I imagine. But time will tell."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waved her hand. "No question, just get me out of here. Your verbose way of speaking is reminding me of the nobility back home and it's giving me a headache." She'd always hated being in meetings with Marigold where she had to listen to the nobles speak down their noses at every little thing, but speak around issues consistently so as to not draw any unwanted or negative attention to themselves. She had frequently just wanted to knock them in the back of the head and tell them to speak normally and tell it to someone straight, but they wouldn't of course and she would never do that. The only one of them that ever spoke to her straight was Marigold, though growing up together certainly helped that. Marigold had learned early in childhood that Ellesandra might tease her for something, but would never hold it against her or over her head. Children made mistakes, and Ellesandra was a ride-or-die friend in keeping those mistakes secret. She looked back at the creature, impatient and waiting. Would she wake from her dream immediately after, or would she still be able to sleep normally? She hoped she didn't wake up screaming or go into a nightmare after this; the creature probably had the power to force that and it would just be plain annoying to do when surrounded by elves and Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Upon the question being passed, the ship faded away to blackness. Their regular dreams were not theirs to have this night; Ellesandra woke, and it was later into morning. They were rested, though the wounds from the night before were certainly still there. Star was still asleep beside Ellesandra. Peaceful, and calm. The gentle sounds of elves moving about outside the tent to tend to morning needs could be heard. It was a calm morning. The dangers of the night prior were gone, now.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra set up quickly, Groaning at the pain that shot through her ribs, she did a quick link glance around to ensure that the shadow wasn't anywhere to be seen, and that they were in the camp as they were when they went to bed. Star was still next to her, and the bustle of the camp in the morning seemed normal. Her muscles still screamed in protest at her movements, still in a state where she would she would need rest to be back to 100% not even considering injuries, but she wasn't going to fall over from fatigue at least. For a moment, she watched Star sleeping to ensure she wasn't having a similarly bad dream. With a grunt, she pushed off of the ground and stood up, stretching and popping multiple bones along the way. Her entire body was still sore, but pain was mostly focused to her rib and thigh. Her arm was a minor ache, where apparently the shrapnel hadn't gone in enough to be a major wound. With her stomach growling loudly, she made her way over to wherever they were serving food. She considered cooking her own out of their stock, but that would just be wasteful in supplies and also might offend their hosts. She took some time to ensure the camp was in order and nothing happened overnight, before bringing two servings of the breakfast back to Star and sitting down next to where she lay. She stretched her leg out so weight wasn't put on the injured thigh and reached out, lightly placing a hand on Stars shoulder and giving her a gentle shake, emotional guard firmly in place to limit any emotional sharing. "Star, you need to get some food in you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The bustle was normal. The air was normal. The shadow was nowhere to be seen or felt. It was just another, normal day. Star looked calm, not at all like a nightmare plagued her. When Ellesandra roused her, she slowly stirred and rubbed at one eye as she slowly came to wake. She looked up at Ellesandra and offered a warm, tender, sleepy smile. "Good morning," she said quietly with a sleepy lilt. "Food...Food sounds good, mmnh." That was enough to get Star slowly rising, still clearly lethargic. Her nose was no longer bloody, and the marks of blood on her dress that were definitely there last night were now...Gone. But all that aside, Star took a few minutes to work up to wakefulness. She had a heavy weight dragging her down with every step, but she was...Happy. She was very clearly happy as she went about her morning routine and sat with Ellesandra for them all to enjoy a morning breakfast that was...Of passing quality. Good enough, filling enough, with at least some delightful fiery char on the meats cooked that had a natural, satisfying quality to it, even if there was nothing in the way of spice. It was a good morning.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched as Star roused and began moving about. She was watching for any sign of injury or worse fatigue that would be of concern, but so far she'd seen none. The blood was gone from her nose, which was good. She considered talking about the shadow in her dream, but didn't quite yet. Let both of then enjoy the morning, fully wake up and then discuss the unpleasantness of that visit. And so, Ellesandra sat to eat the camp food. It was obviously not the best, but also not the worst food she'd had. Despite trying to relax and enjoy the food, which her body desperately needed, there was now a constant paranoia. If the shadow creature could possess people like it had the captain and the pirates, they weren't exactly safe just because they were with the elves. She thought of the gem in her pocket, then shook her head and looked around at the rest of the camp. "We should take advantage of what rest we can get now. I'm still unsure how wise it would be to go into town, and I don't think going back to the settlement with the Elves is on our way to Myst, is it?" It had been a while since Ellesandra had looked at a map, and while she knew the general location of places she'd been, she hadn't been to Myst before. Thus, she was going to be relying on Star - or perhaps seeking to purchase a map- for their direction and guiding. Her job was to keep Star safe, whether that be against mundane people or shadow controlled ones.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
 Star was obviously tired. Her marching would not be wise, that much was obvious. Light travel would be okay, but long distances would require more rest before such a journey. Ellesandra's question about Myst had some of the other elves looking at each other and shrugging. Clearly, they'd never heard of it. Star shook her head. "Part of the way there is shared, but the elvish settlement was north-west, and the directions he showed me on the map have us going north-east. There's...Some degree of shared passage. It's closer physically than Cloverport is. Morrun told us we have to find the people who were from Myst. Sort of...Requires someone who knows how to get there, to get there. As I understand from his explanation, it's not just a place we can walk to. It's a plane all its own. We'll be traveling to another plane of existence to get there, and from there doing the same to get to my home, if his theories and understanding of it all prove to be true," said Star as she finished her breakfast. "I agree that we ought to rest. I don't know that town is dangerous right now, but I'm fine resting in the woods for now if you are uneasy about it. Still. We'll make better time and exhaust ourselves less if we can hire a coach in town."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star, glancing at the nearby elves who seemed confused, then sighed and grumbled. "Have to know someone? I hate knowing people. Means you have to talk to them." The comment was mostly made in jest, trying to inject humor into the camp and Star, even if it wasn't entirely false. Ellesandra was an introvert through and through; guarded because of her trauma and not willing to open up to anyone. Talking to people led to friendships which led to expectation of opening up. So in a way, she was being entirely truthful with the comment. Finishing up her food, she wiped her hands to get rid of the crumbs that might have lasted on her fingers or any of the meat juices, then moved to stand and stretch again. Her muscles ached and she winced, imagining marching back to the elven settlement feeling like this. Even if she could make it, she was almost certain Star wouldn't. "Okay, we can try town. I'll be sure to sleep lightly tonight and we'll see if we can get a room with two beds, so we can be in the same room should anyone try to sneak in." Getting a room at the inn would potentially put a target on them, but it was probably less dangerous than camping in the woods alone. There was no telling if someone might go on a hunt for any stragglers of the army, or looters for anything left behind. Even if the Pirates wouldn't hold a grudge, Ellesandra was not fully betting on that. "Do you think you can make the hike down to the Inn, though? Or should we set up some place nearby to rest more?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star giggled at her companions response. "I'm fine with doing the talking, though you shouldn't sell yourself short. You're plenty likable, whether you like it or not," she said with amusement and affection in equal measure. She wouldn't turn down a chance to be kind to Ellesandra. "I can manage getting into town, it's not that far. I'm not entirely disabled, just want to take it easy today is all. I'm ready to head out when you are."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't quite know how to take the compliment. A huff was all that came out, but there was definitely a stirring of something in her chest. She couldn't identify it - or more like didn't want to identify it - but it was definitely something akin to the way a school girl blushed when given a compliment and her stomach got butterflies. Focusing instead on their plan for the day, Ellesandra grabbed her pack and slung it over her good shoulder, looking down to check to ensure her thigh or arm didn't need rebandaging. The shrapnel hadn't gone so far in that it had bled overnight; it probably had already clotted and was in the process of healing, but she didn't want to replace the bandages quite yet. Walking might reopen the one on her thigh, and she could deal with that when they got to town. "I wasn't claiming you were disabled, I just wanted to ensure that if you needed rest still, you knew we had options. You pushing yourself to the point of collapse can not be a consistent thing. I've known you for just under three full days now and two of those days have come with you doing something reckless that made you fatigued." Granted, those same two days had seen Ellesandra get injured too, but she wasn't about to admit that - or how fatigued she was. She could certainly do a hike to town, but a hike to the elven settlement would have been pushing it for herself as well. "Do we need to report to - actually. Can you point me to any of the magic users here? I'd like to see if they could help check out the gem that was in the Captain's heart before we leave, to ensure it isn't cursed or going to explode on me or anything."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled at the bashful huff. Star hadn't lost her ability to see emotion overnight, so it got her smiling a big, dopey smile for it. She said nothing, however. She just let them huff and save face. On the matter of Star pushing herself to the limit, she pouted playfully. "When we stop getting into life or death situations, I'll stop pushing with all I've got, how's that sound?" she asked with a playful smile. And then, when asked for Star to point out the magic users, she just...Raised a brow and pointed to herself.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra huffed again at the life or death situation comment. "Well if someone wasn't such a meddler, we wouldn't have been in either of those situations." That was probably inaccurate, and Ellesandra wasn't actually upset at Star for meddling. In reality, she would have wanted to do the same had she been on her own, but if she were on her own things probably would have ended very poorly for her. Her hand moved up to her throat and touched the sensitive bruising that was there still, wincing at the thought, then looking back to Star when she pointed to herself regarding the magic user. Rolling her eyes, Ellesandra shook her head and dropped her voice to a whisper. "Considering the shadow demon thing came OUT of this gem and seems hell bent on ensuring you do not continue with your goal of finding your mother, I do not want you touching it at all. There's no telling what kind of trap or curse it might put on you if you do." Hell, she wasn't entirely comfortable carrying it around herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star squinted playfully at Ellesandra, flashing a knowing smile. She had every belief that the knight would not be able to walk away from another in need, just as they hadn't with her. She then sighed through her nose at Ellesandra's worries, at least agreeing that they were valid it seemed as she pointed to the circle of three other elves who were finishing their breakfast. Robed elves who were part of the group of healers. "If you insist, talk to them. But I don't really sense any malicious presence from it. Or much of any magic, though I'm sure it might be different if I held it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pretending not to notice the squint or smile. Instead, she shook her head. "Oh yeah, I'm sure it might be different if you held it. It might possess you and turn you into a creature who doesn't die when I stab him in the head." She paused, then corrected. "Her, in your case." Okay, maybe she was just a little salty about how the pirate didn't die like he should have. She needed to adjust how she planned to fight any other creature she sensed the shadow in, going forward. Hopefully it wouldn't be any creatures, but she doubted that was likely if she continued with Star. Instead of continuing on about that, though, she followed Star's point to one of the robed elves and approached, waving awkwardly to get their attention as she did. "Good morning-" Her voice was stilted, awkward, randomly talking to a stranger to make a request which might endanger them. She honestly didn't want to, but felt like she needed to. "I was wondering - when I killed the captain yesterday, he didn't die normally. Had to stab him through the heart despite stabbing him in the head, and apparently he was being kept alive by this gem..." She reached into her pocket, ensuring skin didn't contact that gem when she pulled it out. "And I was led to believe it might still have a few traces of magic in it. I was wondering if one of you could help check to see what kind of magic, if it's cursed or needs to be destroyed somehow?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded, though she could tell that the knight was bothered by the outcome of fight. Or what it took to get there at least. She could hardly blame them. "I thought for sure you had him. I was relived. But then, when it wasn't the end, well...That's when I lost it, sorta. I'm...Still trying to figure out where that all came from." She gave a soft smile, assuring she was fine, at least would be until Ellesandra came back from the others. The elves in question smiled at Ellesandra, hearing their request. One of them held their hand out to take the gem. When they took it, the elf focused on the gem for a moment. They lightly glowed with mana. A bit of time passed. When they finished, they held the gem back out to Ellesandra. "There was some sort of enchantment on this gemstone. Only broken echoes remain. I could not tell you the purpose, other than it was quite powerful to still have such a presence when broken like this. That said...The spell is broken. It has no effects now that I can detect. Only a malevolent whisper that is fading slowly. I imagine it will lose its power in a few days, possibly crumbling to nothingness from there. If it was within the pirate, then it certainly explains what gave him such power. But with it being so broken, the finer details of what it was supposed to do are lost."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. They would talk about Star's magic use later; when they were alone. While the mage was examining the stone, Ellesandra was patient. She watched the stone carefully, to ensure that the process of identifying it didn't cause any types of chain reaction or something, but eventually she was told that it was turning to a normal stone - maybe even would crumble away into dust. She pursed her lips, looking down at the gem and taking it back when it was offered. A brief though of just tossing it away into the woods with all her strength crossed her mind briefly, but she instead pocketed it again with a nod. "Thanks for the confirmation." If it still had whispers of malevolence, it was possible for someone to randomly stumble upon it and maybe unintentionally empower it again, right? She wouldn't take the chance of throwing it away only for it to harm someone else. She'd let it crumble away in her pocket, instead. With a nod to the healers, she headed back to Star, nodding. "Okay, we should be good to head out. The gem apparently is of no immediate danger, and might fall apart on it's own in a bit of time. Until then, I don't really want a stranger to stumble upon it, so I'll carry it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to Ellesandra. "That is a wise choice I think. Even if it's harmless now, no reason to not be cautious and handle it with care until it's gone," she said, working up to her feet. Being good to head out, Star set about towards the city. Her pace was slow. Cautious to not rush either of them. There was time to chat along the way, though silence wouldn't be broken by Star. Just some smiles now and then. Even in the wake of battle, so long as evil did not win, it seemed there was no shaking Star's pleasant spirit.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched Star move to stand, taking up that protective stance close to her in case she needed assistance. They had both worn themselves out the day before; Star probably more so. Ellesandra's fatigue was muscle weariness, but she'd gone through this plenty of times when forced to use her haste magic like that. She would be sore and feeling it the entire walk back, but she wasn't about to collapse. Star, however, had magically exhausted herself - again. After having done so just recently, Ellesandra was worried about her stamina and ability to make this trek. Still, she didn't say anything as they collected their things and began the hike down to the town, staying close enough to reach out and take an arm or help steady Star if needed. She didn't speak, not really having much to say in her normal no-small-talk way, and also wanting to ensure that they could focus on their trip and not get distracted or fall due to it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star managed to keep steady. She wouldn't turn down Ellesandra's arm if offered, but it was taken with a tenuous grasp. Her ability to maintain the emotional wall in tandem with the knight was a little fragile. A steady stream of connected emotions, echoes of the other person, would bleed through while connected. So if the desire was to hold on anyway, there would be plenty of Star's serene, pleasant happiness to feel bleeding through the connection, muted and muffled by the attempts to solidify the barrier between them, as well as an ever-present concern for the other woman. Regardless, the walk proved uneventful and the people in town were working with some of the elvish soldiers to clean up the mess. The bombs had left scorched stone in some places, broken patches of stone in others, some minor property destruction to be found, and plenty of mopping to deal with the spatters of blood. Among the people were what appeared to be city guardsman, who hadn't been too great in number before the war, but seemed to be far more numerous now. Where did they all come from? Where were they when the city needed them? Questions remained unanswered for the moment. But nobody seemed hostile, either. Rather, the people seemed cordial. Thankful. There'd be no resistance to walking into the inn to book a room for the night, as if nothing even happened. There was some lingering fear on the faces of the people but...More than anything, relief.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra looked around, both on guard and cautious, but also feeling for the citizens. While they obviously looked relieved to have the pirates gone and no longer be under their spell or rule, there had obviously been damage and likely deaths. She kept a special eye on the city guard she saw; it was entirely possible they had been under some sort of magic just like the pirates had been, but it was also possible they'd simply been paid off, so until anything was clear Ellesandra was going to be on guard. She stayed closer to Star than normal, just far enough away she could avoid touching Star unless necessary, to make it clear that they were together and Star was under her protection. When they got to the Inn, she would first go about requesting a room for the night and more food. It wasn't that it was that long since they'd begun their trek that morning and eaten breakfast, but they both needed to rejuvenate a lot of energy - be it physical or magical - and food would help with this. She didn't go straight up to their room, but would indicate Star find a table to sit at and join her after ordering food -extra fruits and veggies for Star - and some water, and leaning against the table across from her. "We should talk about the shadow. I had another dream last night. Ellesandra kept her voice low, but felt no need to hide this from Star. If anything, Star deserved to know what she was potentially up against, on this journey.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was certainly feeling for the people as well. Perhaps better than anyone else could. No immediate signs of civilian deaths could be observed, but it's possible the dead had all been carted away already to be buried. It certainly put a damper on Star's smile, though she sought solace in the fact that their actions were simply dousing an infected wound with medicine. Pain felt now to save greater pain later. There was only so much that could comfort her, of course. Being given an extra helping of her preferred food from her knightly companion, a small showing of thoughtfulness, did bring her spirits up a little once more, however. It wasn't the food that made her smile, but rather that her companion noticed and remembered such things. They could hide behind the guise of duty all day, but Star had an advantage in her sight that made such lies even more flimsy than they were on the surface. She was clearly still hungry as she began into her food, though politely paused when acknowledging the other's words. "Is that so?" she asked with a troubled tone, kept low all the same. They had a booth together that would allow them to keep their discussion private enough, so long as they were mindful with their volume. "Please...Do tell."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked down at her own plate, spearing a piece of an egg and chewing it slowly while considering how to approach this topic. She probably should have considered that more on the walk here, or even explained it on the walk, but she had wanted to look into Star's eyes while explaining it. To see how Star reacted to some of the news, or if Star had intentionally been hiding the resonance bit from her for some reason. She chewed slowly while considering before looking up to her. "Well, there was a lot discussed. In summary, you and I share a 'resonance' which is apparently the connection between your magic and why it's so easy for you to interact with my emotions. Not a fan of that, by the way." That probably didn't need to be said; Star fully well knew by now that Ellesandra was a very private person about her thoughts and emotions and found it invasive that Star could just see that naturally. "And that the enemy of this shadow creature, unnamed, is what organized us coming together. The shadow creature orchestrated all of this, and has multiple other servants like the captain being controlled by some gem like thing. And they're set against you reaching your destination; claiming that if I go with you it will empower you to continue rather than giving up and lead to both of our deaths." She paused, trying to think if there was anything else she'd missed in that very high level summary. "And encouraging me to abandon you because you won't be as likely to get close, and thus die, to your destination. Oh, and that if you made it to Myst you'd die. So, we're on the right track, at least." She began to reach for the water, then paused. "And I think they confirmed that they were the influence that took your previous guardian from you. Unclear, by that point I was getting a headache at it's damn political talk of walking around a point."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star wore a little pout when Ellesandra made a point of how they weren't a fan. A face that spoke of how she wasn't really able to control it. "It's not normal for me, either," she said quietly, still pouting a bit. "But...Are you sure? I've...Never been fully resonant with someone before," she said, which then prompted her to blush. "...A-Are you...Sure that is the word the shadow used?" she asked, with her embarrassment to the fact alluding to there being more to it than the shadow had told. She had to ponder the other parts. The enemy of the shadow got them together? Was that a good thing? It was a lot to take in. But the overall message was clearly one of trying to dissuade the pair from continuing. "Mmnh....And, well. I won't stop. But I also hope you know that you're not...Bound to me. Forced to be here, or anything. N-Not that I...Want you to go, or anything. Quite the opposite. But given how much has happened in just the few days you've known me I wouldn't blame you now or ever if you decided your path went elsewhere. Not...Advocating for it. Just making sure you know that I care about you and your choice in the matter, whatever it may be. So long as it's your true feelings."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned at Star's reaction to the word resonant. The blush made her tilt her head, eyes narrowing curiously and observing what she could of the mage before her. "Yes, I'm pretty sure it used the word resonance. Explained that it's some musical harmony between aura's or something." A brief wave of her hand. She hadn't fully understood what it was talking about. "And how it usually builds over time from some sort of emotion, I'm assuming a loyalty or bond or love or something like that. And that for it to have been a natural, immediate occurrence for us was rare, which is honestly just a little more annoying." She paused after saying this, guilt creeping in again. She knew this wasn't Star's fault, and didn't want her to constantly feel bad about something she could control. Picking up a piece of bacon, she chewed on it and leaned back into her seat, glancing around the Inn for a generic perusal and ensuring they hadn't drawn any unwelcome attention so far. "I'm not leaving, and while it seems like you stopping your journey would be the best thing for your safety, I both don't believe you will and also refuse to give into the obvious manipulations of some sort of higher power. Confirmed not deity, at least by it's own mouth, but still some sort of higher asshole being." Ellesandra obviously didn't like being directed by any form of 'fate' or manipulated by those who thought they were simply beyond mortal.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile. "Then we're agreed that I was already going to do all of this, but someone telling me not to is just going to make me do it even harder," she said, her smile growing playful. A little light-heartedness, for the daunting task grew ever more daunting with the knowledge of such an enemy that would see them fail. She paused to bite into the apple she had and thoughtfully chew it before circling back. "...What they said about resonance is true, at least insofar as what my mother told me. My two mothers had resonance with one another, though it was not immediate. Auras grow more naturally attuned to each other in time, with longer exposure. At some point you'll be able to see my natural aura to some degree, though without my gift it might not make much sense. Colourful, if nothing else. I don't want to bore you with the ins and outs of it all. But when we first met I'm sure you noticed how I stared at you for so long. I've never felt a connection to another's aura like this before, and I've been trying to figure it out. I...Hadn't assumed it was full resonance; like you were told, it's exceptionally rare. Enough that in all my travels you're the first." Lucky them. If anything, Star assumed Ellesandra found it to be more of a curse than a blessing. "...But without taking the time for us to expose our auras together, resonance does little beyond act as a strong...Compatibility. Musical harmony is a decent way to think of it I guess. It's the first time I've had to actively separate our auras as they try to mingle when we touch, like I said. But...Resonance..." Once more, there was some allusion to potential benefits to be gained from this quality, though Star seemed to assume Ellesandra wanted nothing to do with any of it. Or maybe just didn't want to babble magical words at them over second breakfast.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't actually noticed how Star had stared at her, not really. She'd just thought the staring was hoping that Ellesandra would help her, trying to plead with her silently or something. The intense stare hadn't been out of the normal, and as they'd walked to town she'd figured Star was just seeing her emotions, once that became a thing that Ellesandra knew Star could do. Ellesandra did have a lot of them, even if they were repressed, so it hadn't been abnormal for her. The idea of her being Star's first, in regards to this resonance thing, was just her damn luck. Or, this strange other figure who had orchestrated them together. She hadn't forgotten about that, and though it irritated her she didn't really have a purpose of just stewing in said irritation. "Well, I'm not a musician, so I'm not about to be making any kind of aura harmony with you intentionally." A joke, to try to lighten the mood a little. And get them off such a serious topic in which Ellesandra was feeling both distaste for how invasive Star's power was, and also guilty at that feeling because she knew it wasn't something Star was choosing to do. She didn't hold it against Star, per say, but it still made her even more cautious and guarded around her than she might be - and that was a little unfair. She finished off the last of her plate and slid it to the side, taking a longer drink of water and gazing out into the Inn again. "I'm getting the sense your magic would be stronger if I let this resonance or whatever work, but I'm not going to just let you in. I'm not okay with that. So I'm drawing a firm boundary here, okay?" She didn't look at Star as she said this, unsure what refusing that might mean for Star - or even she even could control this at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "There's a reason I didn't bring up all the ways it could be beneficial to our adventures. You don't need to redraw boundaries that you've already drawn," she said with a voice that was two parts respectful to one part...Sad. Perhaps disappointed. But there was resignation which joined her tone, an acceptance despite her own desires for the state of affairs. She looked at the last remnants of her food, moving a finger to roll a lone blueberry that she was saving for last around on her plate in little circles. She didn't look at Ellesandra either as she continued to speak. "I'm doing what I can to keep the boundary firm between us...I just need you to know that anything that might spill through that isn't intentional. I'm a little out of my depth with you. But it...At the very least allows my sympathetic healing to be most effective on you, and effortlessly performed, should we need to leverage it. Should you permit it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt - was it pain? No, it wasn't quite pain, but the guilt and feeling bad about causing that sadness in Star was so similar to the guilt and pain combination she felt for Marigold that she felt it like that. Her jaw clenched, knowing that this boundary was something Star might not like or understand. Star was too willing and open to share things, and Ellesandra the exact opposite. How their 'auras' could have any form of harmony with how different they were was beyond the knight. She snorted at the sympathetic healing bit, mumbling - "Great, an easier way for my mistakes to cause someone else pain." She didn't refuse it, though. Star had a good point that, in the moment, it might be absolutely necessary. And if it were, Ellesandra would accept it - but ONLY if she agreed it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise, she was going to keep that rule of it not happening firmly in place. "So, next steps. Go find someone who has come from Myst and encourage them to lead us back there, somehow." Her arms crossed and she finally turned fully to look at Star again. "I think we should stay here at least two days before we start on that, assuming the place continues to be hospitable. We both need that rest, and we'll reassess the second day on if we need to stay longer to recover or are fine to head out afterwards. Does that sound like a plan?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There wasn't enough ambient noise to drown out Ellesandra's mumbling. It was likely intended to just vent internal frustrations, but the comment...It struck Star deep. A mix of sorrow and anger swirled in her, leaving her uncharacteristically silent and focused on her plate as Ellesandra got down to business. Normally quite attentive and chipper, the empath looked like someone sucked the wind out of her sails in the moment. Enough that when the knight asked if it sounded like a plan, they earned only a set of three small nods from Star as she continued to circle that blueberry around on her plate under the pad of her index finger.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She noticed star staring at her plate, but she'd been staring it for a while so Ellesandra hadn't thought anything of it. It wasn't until Star gave just a few small nods that Ellesandra stopped and examined Star closer. Guilt rose again, gnawing at her. But what the hell was she guilty of? For having a boundary? Anger swirled among it, that her having boundaries was harder on Star, that Star could so easily feel and unintentionally slip past those boundaries. She reigned it in though, knowing that being angry at Star wasn't right, and it would just later make her feel even more guilty for how Star would likely react to it. She was the type you had to treat with a very gentle hand, sensitive in more ways than one but willing to be stubborn and stand up against you. Ellesandra sighed, rubbing at her right shoulder and the scar beneath her armor and clothes unconsciously. She couldn't even touch it directly due to her armor, but the habit was there. She didn't know how to handle Star and her openness compared to Ellesandra's own closed off behavior, so instead Ellesandra didn't say anything. She would sit there silently, eyeing the last bit of blueberry on Star's plate for a moment before turning her eyes out to look into the Inn and keep watch until Star was ready to chat or go up to their room; because Ellesandra had insisted on a single room with two beds.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star eventually plucked the blueberry and placed it between her lips. She closed her eyes, pensively savouring the tart, sweet berry for a moment. She remained quiet for a while longer. Whatever it was that ate at her was deep in her heart, clearly. "We should go up to the room, let you get out of your armor if you intend on it. I should focus on meditating." Despite stating this, she didn't immediately rise, waiting for Ellesandra to do so and lead the way.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star spoke again, Ellesandra turned to look at her, then nodded. She very much did want to get out of her armor, having slept in it the night before as well. It was never comfortable to do so, and she knew her underclothes were extremely sweaty right now. Moving to stand and grab her bag, she left the plates and everything on the counter for the waitress. She didn't just walk away, standing beside the table and waiting to ensure Star could stand and didn't need help, and then leading them upstairs to the room the innkeep had indicated. A glance was given around to ensure there weren't any watchers or sentient looking shadows nearby, before opening the door and stepping in. A quick sweep was given around the room as well before stepping to the side to let Star enter, and to confirm that the room was indeed a two bed room. If there was one she'd give it to Star, but it would be nice to have one herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star stood silently and moved with the knight. The room was as described. There were no menacing looking shadows. There might have been a moment where it seemed there were monsters under the bed, but upon closer inspection it would be just a dust bunny moving with the wind of the door opening. A small attached room had a shower to enjoy. A bit cramped, but serviceable. A stack of white towels was also supplied to be used as needed. The sheets and bedding were white. Clean. The two beds were comfortable enough. Far better than a bedroll, but otherwise mediocre. Star wordlessly entered when permitted, and helped herself to seat herself on her bed, electing to stare at the floor for a little while. They had two days to burn, now.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the silence like a damn weight. Normally, she was comfortable with silence - enjoyed it, even. But this silence from Star wasn't natural. She didn't know what it was that she'd done that had upset Star, but something obviously had. Was it the comments about boundaries? She wasn't sure, but with the door closed she watched Star for a few moments, just staring at the floor. Aggravation at herself and her inability to comfort a stranger, how awkward she was with people, built up. She didn't say anything, though. Instead she checked the attached shower room for danger, then set about taking her armor off. It was a relatively long process doing it herself, and in her muscle's weakened state causing the soreness to spike when reaching for the straps beneath her arms. It took about ten minutes to be stripped down to her leggings and tight undershirt, both of which were rank and covered in sweat and blood from the battle and then sleeping in them. She moved to her back and pulled out a change of clothes, laying them to the side. Her right shoulder in particular was bothering her, a symptom of the guilt that seemed to creep up when she was feeling particularly bad, and now it being free she reached and lightly massaged at the damaged muscle at the top. She didn't go straight for the shower though, like she wanted to. She wanted to rinse the stink and blood of her wounds away, change her wound dressings and check on her ribs. Instead, she sat on her own bed and motioned with her head for Star to take the first shower. "Yours if you want it first." The first words spoken to her since arriving, the tension of whatever was wrong having been left to build or go away on it's own.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took a look over Ellesandra as they took off their clothes. The offer was enough to lighten her mood a tiny bit, enough to eke out a tiny smile. Thoughtful as always. "I mean this in the absolute most respectful way I can possible say it, Ellesandra...You need it first." She smiled again. "You look like you were suffering under your armor. So please. I think it's best I take time to meditate for a moment anyway." Her tone lowered as she spoke, moving to a bit over a whisper by the end. That was all she seemed to have to say on the matter, then went back to staring at the floor.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't disagree. She knew she stunk right now, but had been used to this before. Still, at the confirmation to do it first Ellesandra had stood. She watched Star seem to disappear into herself again, a frown crossing her face and concern now showing. This wasn't just a little feeling bad, was it? Star was troubled by something, relatively deeply. Ellesandra stood awkwardly for a moment, not knowing how to approach the topic, before she shook her head. Best not to, since she was probably the one who had caused the issue to begin with. Knowing herself, she'd just make it worse. So, Ellesandra turned to the shower. "Don't open the door for anyone until I'm out." The warning came over her shoulder as she was pulling her jerkin off. She didn't have any concerns with modesty, but she did close the door to just a crack. Open enough that she'd easily be able to hear if anything went wrong in the main room, but closed enough that no one would just see her standing nude in there. There was a chance, if Star had looked up and seen her as she was walking in, that Star would have seen the scars across Ellesandra's back. Whip marks for the most part, as well as an ugly scar that was on the back of her right shoulder where some sort of blade had pierced straight through her shoulder. Harder to see was another one further down her right arm, between her elbow and shoulder. And lastly, a thin scar on her left rib where someone had obviously cut deep into it from the side. There was also a noticeable lack of muscle definition on her right side, when compared to that of her left. With her back turned to Star as she entered, it was only briefly - but Ellesandra's lack of modesty or attempting to hide said scars spoke to a likelihood of Star seeming them later on in their travels anyways. She took a quick shower, assuming no interruptions, using the water and a little bit of a lavender scented soap she carried in her pack in a wood box to help with the worst of the stench. She kept the old bandages on her wounds for now, planning to change them out after rather than removing to be stung by the water. She did dry off inside and put on her clothes with the door just cracked before re-entering the bedroom, doing another quick glance around to ensure Star was still there, and safe.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star flicked her eyes at Ellesandra as they moved into the shower. Enough to catch a glimpse, but little more. She sat with the knowledge for a while. Specifically, as long as Ellesandra took to shower. No disturbances came. When the other woman emerged, Star was seated on her bed, the one closer to the wall as she imagined Ellesandra would prefer the one closer to the door for the security of the arrangement, with legs folded and hands in a meditative position upon her knees. Her aura was visible in this moment. A swath of blue that flowed in wispy waves up along her figure. Her aura was a beautiful sight to behold; the colour was vivid, though ethereal and transparent. There was no real influence of emotion while looking upon it, though one could imagine Star saw something similar, but around all other people. Except Star could read it. What just appeared to be colourful to the knight held a wealth of information for someone like Star. Enough to see mountains that weren't there. Enough to know when someone was lying. Enough to see straight through someone's emotional armor. Yet in return, even when her aura was plainly visible to the naked eye, it gave...Nothing. Just a pretty, enchanting blue colour that clung to her. She seemed focused on this, though soon after Ellesandra came out of the shower, she naturally concluded whatever she was meditating on. Her aura vanished slowly, then, as she looked pensively at...The floor again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pulled up to a stop when she saw the blue aura around Star. She stared at it in confusion at first, then once she realized what she was seeing she quickly turned away. If it was her aura, or her emotions, she had no right to stare at it and try to figure it out - not when she spent so much effort on building a barrier and boundary between herself and Star. Sitting on what would be her bed, she pulled her hair up into a ponytail so the wet strands would be out of her face, only glancing over at Star when she heard Star moving out of the meditative state. The continued pensive look at the floor made Ellesandra feel like something was terribly wrong. For someone like Star, to go so long like this without saying anything, what was she working through? The blue aura came to mind, but Ellesandra had no idea what that would mean. Her only guess was sadness, but just because something was blue didn't mean it was necessarily sad, right? And even so there was probably way more niche information that Ellesandra didn't know what to look for, even if she had wanted to. Still, the possibility that she'd done something to so thoroughly upset Star that she had gone silent and staring at random things bothered Ellesandra enough to speak up and break the silence. "What exactly has you so quiet and introspec-introver-er." Introspective was the word she was going for, but the way to say it was slipping her mind. She blinked, thinking, and having a complete brain fart on it shook her head. "thoughtful?" She finished, reaching into her bag for the medical supplies to begin working on rebandaging her arm, raising her sleeve up to do so.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked up when Ellesandra stumbled over their words. She gave them a smile. No judgement, just patience as they figured out what they were trying to say. She then had to stare at Ellesandra for a few moments as she gathered what she wanted to say. "...I can't tell you, Ellesandra," she said, still smiling a small, sad smile. "It'll just lead to questions that I can't ask, and topics that aren't allowed. I'll be okay. Promise. I just...Need some time to feel sad. The sad feeling won't go away until I...Feel it. Let it be felt. Let it...Naturally flow through me. It'll be okay." An attempt at a reassuring smile followed, though it wasn't...Very reassuring at all. Star still wore her emotions plainly. And she was hurting inside. She fought against that hurt, trying desperately to put on a smile to allow Ellesandra to be happy, too. Or as happy as they could be, given the mountain that didn't exist that wasn't weighing on them at all.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It took Ellesandra a moment to realize what she meant. Was she sad for Ellesandra? Because of her being so guarded? Or was that pity? Defensiveness rose in her and she shifted a little uncomfortably, thinking of what Star might feel she couldn't ask or topics that weren't allowed. The concept of just letting herself feel sad was foreign to Ellesandra though; sadness was a weakness. She didn't let herself feel it, only feeling it when it forced itself out. Shaking her head, she turned her attention to the bandaging and ensuring that the cut in her arm was healing decently enough. She'd do her thigh afterwards, just taking them one step at a time. "You're allowed to ask anything, just respect me being allowed to say no or not answer." She hadn't been sure she wanted to open that door; it was probably easier for Star to just not ask when Ellesandra knew she'd stonewall the mage anyways. But the idea that Star thought she couldn't even ask potentially unrelated questions bothered Ellesandra; her boundary was around herself, not around Star's ability to ask questions.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to the words given. "I do. And I also don't want to fight with you, even a little. So it's prudent for me to acknowledge when the things I feel, the things I want to say, are only going to lead us towards my desire to...Talk to you about things you do not want to talk about, and your desire to, well...Not. It's just hard for me, y-you know?" she said, doing her best to repress what was clearly a rising sorrow that threatened to make her cry. Her voice shook, but she paused to breathe and steady herself, keeping her on the calm side of things. "I can't help who I am. I can't help that hearing about how you blame yourself tears me up inside. And I don't even want to say such things...Because then, well...Is that not just all the more likely to make you redouble your desire to push it all down? To pound upon your heart with an iron first until it submits, not caring for what wounds you leave in the wake?" She bit her lip here. "Just...I'll stop. Before I get carried away. I have...Too much to say, and as I said I...Can't bear to argue with you. I don't want to. It hurts..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked up after finishing her bandage, watching Star struggle to keep her voice calm, to repress the tears. The guilt built again, but she also pushed it back down again. Then winced when Star called her out for doing that exact thing. She couldn't win, could she? How was she supposed to respond to this? The only way she thought Star would be okay with her responding to it would be to completely open up, but Ellesandra wasn't okay with that, so they were very much at odds there. She pursed her lips, watching Star for a moment, then stood and walked over to her. Sitting down on the bed next to Star, she raised her arm to begin wrapping it around Star. She went slowly, so that Star could pull away if she wasn't okay with that, but would allow space for Star to be pulled into her side and place her head on Ellesandra's shoulder, should she wish. The touch was hesitant. Ellesandra's emotional barriers were up as strongly as she could put them up, even if they weren't entirely effective. But she didn't want Star repressing emotions just for her. Ellesandra repressed emotions for herself; Star didn't. "If you need to cry, and you're comfortable with doing it, then do so. No words are necessary for why." She held back an apology, wanting to tell her she was sorry for how much baggage she brought with her. She was also supremely uncomfortable with offering this touch, but if it was a matter of making Star feel better, or living in her own discomfort, she would choose Star's feelings every time. At least, in something as small as just offering physical touch as support.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star might have been able to see the internal struggle Ellesandra faced, if she was looking at them. But she shifted her head back to looking at the floor. Her favourite patch of floor, in fact, in this whole room. She only did look up again when Ellesandra rose to move over to her bed. She was uncertain how to feel about it, but she didn't have much time before Ellesandra joined her and opened an arm to her, then went beyond a mere offer to forwardly bring her into a hug. She wouldn't have the emotional fortitude to resist a hug from Ellesandra at her apex, so feeling so vulnerable in the moment she was helpless. She leaned against them, rested her head against their shoulder, and quietly let a few tears flow from her. One hand moved along their back, the other slid up to their opposite shoulder to gently cling to it. Her eyes closed and she simply...Basked in the comfort Ellesandra's hug gave her. It didn't fix anything. It just...Helped. Made the hurt quiet. She had no reservations crying in front of Ellesandra, even if the reverse wasn't true. But with the comforts provided, Star was not breaking down into sobs. Just a silent stream of tears, free from sobs. Maybe the occasional sniffle. Truly, it did help her. The emotional barriers were raised, but there still was some amount of...Leakage that seemed to be unable to be closed. As if the dam was permanently damaged. Was it because Star was unable to maintain her side of it? Certainly, she was more capable of it than Ellesandra's budding control over it. Or perhaps it was more to do with the resonance? Either way, some of Star's sorrow leaked through into Ellesandra. Not to force them to feel the same, but for them to have that, perhaps familiar at this point, out-of-body understanding of the emotion that Star felt, exactly as she felt it. It carried echoes disturbingly similar to Ellesandra's own guilt. The desire to help...The contested sensation of inadequacy...The self-sacrificial desire to take pain unto one's self...A pain that resonated with flickers of guilt, of ownership. Star's emotions were complex, perhaps only because she allowed herself to feel them all; by contrast, Ellesandra might struggle to feel little beyond guilt overwhelming at times. But Star? Star let her emotions flow free in her heart. The clashing of guilt, of sorrow, of determination, of everything she could feel in the moment all at once. And though Ellesandra was feeling only a tiny echo of it, the complexity, even if not the raw intensity, was plain for them to feel. Sitting behind that dam was a wave of emotion that would dwarf the mountain of guilt that Ellesandra definitely did not feel. For it was not just emotion on its own; Star's very emotion sung with power within her aura. Even here, in her sadness, the slow blossoming of mana from her heart was clear and trivial to pinpoint in this moment, where it had been so obscure before. From emotion, Star was empowered.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Even through the barrier, she sensed the sorrow and guilt coming from Star as well. Ellesandra winced as she felt it, coming through the apparent aura bond they had, or whatever it was to Ellesandra. She took a deep breath, doing her best to ignore it, and looking away from Star's tears. They made her uncomfortable, and her half hug - while fully intended and not half-hearted, because she did want to make Star feel better - was awkward at best. Still, her eyes turned up to look at the door while Star silently just, felt. She just lived with the sadness that was in her, let it process, and honestly this was something that Ellesandra was a little envious of. The ability to just feel emotions and then have them not be a thing anymore - she didn't think she could do that. The pure depth to Star's emotions rivaled Ellesandra's own - nay, maybe even outdid it, though Ellesandra didn't actually feel them to be able to properly compare. It was almost overwhelming, feeling the pressure behind all of Star's emotion, and how she was just letting it slowly work through herself. She did her best to not let any of this become obvious or noticeable to Star, not wanting to distract Star from how she processed her own emotions, or make her think she needed to take care of Ellesandra instead. There were no words spoke, not unless Star said anything first, Ellesandra just looking around the room quietly and waiting it out, providing physical comfort as essentially the only thing she could do in this situation. Her hand, which had stayed in a single spot on Star's side for a few minutes at first, had begun to lightly rub up and down, like someone might do to one's back when trying to comfort.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The physical comfort continued to be everything that Star needed, short of actually addressing any of...This. Nothing was solved by this moment they shared, but it at least provided Star with gentle reassurances that Ellesandra, to whatever degree, cared about her. Concern enough to be there when she was vulnerable despite their own discomfort. Of course Star could feel the discomfort. The envy. The subtle feeling of being overwhelmed. She could see it in the moments where her eyes were open, even if the direct connection between them had an attempt to block the two off from one another, a barrier both women tried to maintain but ultimately could not perfect. But these things did not distract Star. She accepted the comfort. The gentle rubbing in particular invited her to shuffle just slightly more against the knight and hold just a tiny bit tighter. Ellesandra might feel awkward or uncertain or a thousand other apprehensive emotions at this physical contact, but Star always was, and perhaps always would be, open with such emotion and tenderness around those close to her. Eventually, the tears did stop. Calmness and serenity returned, slowly. It was not happiness that took the place of sorrow, but...Calm neutrality was still a step towards the right direction. Not wishing to further discomfort Ellesandra, Star slowly retreated from the hold once she had weathered the worst of her bubbling emotion. Eyes were a bit puffy, but mostly dry now. Despite this, she still didn't seem to have much to say aside from a quiet, almost inaudible 'Thank you' said as she pulled away and a vaguely forced smile. She retreated into her mind again, staring off at nothing. As promised, she seemed...Okay. A stable state, one that would allow her to hold a conversation if Ellesandra wanted to talk. But whatever deeper, underlying troubles she had remained. The aforementioned forbidden subjects weighed on her still. Truly, it could only be a matter of time before the empath was overcome by her own empathy for someone as deeply troubled as Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She released Star when she started to pull away. The almost inaudible thank you was ignored, if it had been heard at all. As Star pulled away and began staring away again, Ellesandra watched her for a moment. Her concern was only increased with the continued silence. Sure, Star wasn't crying any more, but she obviously still struggled with something. Ellesandra wouldn't push it though, letting Star process whatever was bothering her how she wished, just like Ellesandra would like to do if something was bothering her. Standing, she headed over to her own bed and moved to the side that would have her back to Star, slightly pulling down breeches enough to rebandage the wound on her thigh. Ellesandra didn't bring anything else up, letting the afternoon go silently until or unless Star said anything. She finished replacing the bandage on her thigh after disinfecting the wound with a bit of alcohol, then pulled her breeches back up entirely and turned to lay back on the bed. Her body was still sore, and needed rest, but she didn't sleep, her right arm thrown up to rest across her forehead while she stared up at the ceiling. Quiet and resting her fatigued muscles, but not letting herself fully rest for fear that Star would go do something stupid like sneak out while Ellesandra was asleep and get herself into trouble.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star seemed to deflate a little more as Ellesandra moved away from her. Had they done something wrong? It was impossible to say. She simply was in her own mind, stuck and introspective. But she didn't stop the knight from departing. She just adjusted to delve into meditation again. She remained in this posture for some time; eventually, her aura once again became visible. Where there was one just a solid, medium blue, there was now a swath of colour. She did not glow with any particular luminosity while meditating, so it would not prove to be a disturbance to Ellesandra if they did close their eyes or attempt to sleep. But if they did observe, the colours that mingled into her aura were a complicated mess covering the entire rainbow, every colour fathomable flickering in and out of existence upon her still mostly blue aura. A turbulence, perhaps? Was this what Star saw in others? It was simply...Indecipherable. It had no meaning in the moment, despite it's quiet beauty. She remained in this for hours, silent and unmoving. Night would come before she broke out of this meditative state, unless Ellesandra had reason to disturb her from it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't realize Star had still wanted her there, after pulling away. Ellesandra was the type to want space, and she had just assumed Star had wanted the same once she'd pulled away from the hug. As she lay there and saw the colors out of the corner of her eye, she turned to glance at them. She didn't realize she was staring at first, frowning as she tried to see all the different colors, but then when she realized what she was looking at - the same aura and emotions that Star supposedly saw in other people, an insight to someone's emotions and maybe thoughts, she instantly turned her head away. Star was much more open about her emotions, but Ellesandra still wasn't going to just try to read or decipher what she saw simply because she saw them. As pretty and interesting as the colors were, and odd as it was to see all of them surrounding Star while she meditated, Ellesandra was respecting a privacy that wasn't even asked for; a desire to do the type of thing that she herself wished could be done for her. And so, the majority of the day passed. At some point while Star was meditating, Ellesandra had let herself drift off into a nap. It was one of those hyper aware naps, where any movement or sound caused her eyes to open and to look in that direction. The type of thing someone who was trained to guard someone and be woken by the smallest of things could do easily, but looked like she was just sleeping fitfully to anyone else. She shifted positions a handful of times, just letting the relaxing afternoon work it's magic on healing them. As night approached, she did move to stand and stretch, working out kinks in muscles, before going to the door. She considered interrupting Star to ask what she wanted for dinner, but decided to let her stay in meditation while she slipped out of the room to go get some dinner for them both. About ten minutes later, after Ellesandra had watched the stairs leading to their room like a hawk for any potential danger headed towards Star while waiting for food, she came back in with two steaming plates of food. Some beef and potatoes with a healthy serving of brown gravy over both, and some vegetables. Ellesandra had obviously moved some of the veggies from her own plate over to Star's, but it wasn't like she'd gotten rid of all of her own. "Star." Was all she said as she entered, to ensure that if the movement and noise, or smell of the food, didn't bring Star out of her meditation then maybe her name would.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It was difficult to tell how much awareness Star had while she was meditating. Either she was just unaware of things, or she was aware and just very good at keeping still and not paying mind to them. Not that there was much to disturb her, but it very much did appear she was deep in whatever trance state she had assumed. When Ellesandra returned, the colours had shifted to a uniform, sky blue. No other flecks of other colours to be seen. Hearing her name, however, saw her aura receding again. She looked at Ellesandra and wore a lightly exhausted smile. She was still tired. The meditation seemed to steady her, but more than that it was seeing Ellesandra's thoughtfulness again that had her smiling. She adjusted in her seat on the bed to accept the food, taking note of the adjusted portion. If the meat portions were equal, Star would offer to give about half of her beef portion to the other. After all, it wasn't just that she had her preference, but also that she knew Ellesandra's own. She had noticed the way the knight had delighted in filling their plate with meat just as she delighted in berries and steamed vegetables. It was a perfect balance where each one had the complimentary desire for the less preferred thing on the other's plate. It was a small thing. But as much as the two clashed on the matters of the heart, this was one way in which the two were in perfect harmony with each other. Yet aside from any transactional dialogue, Star still, uncharacteristically, had little to say. Perhaps she was just hungry.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra allowed Star to move some of her meat onto her plate, though was careful to watch how much. Even if Star didn't like meat much, she needed the protein and sustenance to help recover. The continued silence worried Ellesandra, but only in that it was abnormal for Star. She was comfortable with silence, enjoyed it even, so it wasn't the silence itself that bothered her at all. However, the longer it went on as they ate and Star still didn't say anything, seeming withdrawn, the more Ellesandra was concerned for Star's well being. She wanted to ask what was wrong, but knew that doing that would open up conversation paths that would not end well, based on what Star had said previously. It was honestly best to just let the situation lie as it was, trusting Star would get over whatever it was and move on, back to her normal self. Which was exactly what Ellesandra would do. She'd finish her food, and when Star was done she'd take their plates and drinks back downstairs to be washed. When she returned, unless Star would do anything different than normal, Ellesandra would go about nightly activities. She took it easy on any exercise, since her body was still recovering from her haste spell, and simply worked on stretching out her right shoulder muscle to work out the kinks and soreness that came with it whenever she used overused it - which meant anytime she used the haste spell. There were a few twinges of pain, but nothing that was unexpected for old injuries, and afterwards she would lay back down, content to just rest like she'd done the whole day.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The silence was comfortable for Ellesandra, but there were subtle signs that it wasn't ideal for Star. She had a lot on her mind, and she certainly was no stranger to sorting through her emotion, through her thoughts. But even if she smiled when sharing her portion of meat with Ellesandra, mindful to keep some to herself but ensuring of course in turn that the thoughtful sharing of some of the knight's food with her wasn't putting the knight themselves at a caloric deficit, the smile came with a weight hanging on it. The truth of the matter was that what it was at the core wasn't even a terribly big deal. Star being such an emotional woman simply meant that certain things struck her deeply, and she wasn't able to, or perhaps willfully did not hide her emotions like Ellesandra did. Perhaps she could don a mask and Ellesandra would be none the wiser to any of it. But as much as Ellesandra might feel the privacy of emotion was unequal, Star's emotional sensitivity ensured that no special powers were required to read her emotions in the moment. She ate. She was polite. She spoke when spoken to...But she was stuck inside herself for the time being, and if Ellesandra wasn't about to do anything to change it, then Star would go through her nightly routine and settle into bed without a word.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't do anything, not at first. The night passed normally and as Star was beginning to do her nightly wind down activities, Ellesandra suddenly stood and moved to the door. "Be right back." She slipped out, ensuring that Star didn't think she was suddenly leaving or anything. About ten minutes later, she'd return and open the door, but not enter. She was carrying two mugs with some sort of steaming hot liquid in them that smelled of something sweet - chocolate. She stood in the doorway and motioned with her head for Star to follow her. "Come." It was an order, and one that Ellesandra said simply expecting Star to follow along. She'd turn, walking down the hallway, and assuming she didn't get to the door at the end of the hall without Star following her, would open it and lead Star up some stairs. Without a word, she'd hand Star both mugs for a moment, reaching up and pulling down a trap door from the ceiling, which had a ladder that folded out from it. Then taking both cups again, she balanced them between her right arm and her torso to prevent spillage and began climbing the ladder with her left arm mainly, using her right elbow to stabilize on each step. Exiting the top, they were on the roof of the Inn. She ensured Star would get up to the roof without difficulty, then move to find a good place to sit in the center. Not too sloped, so that they didn't have to worry about sliding at all, and not blocked by anything, handing one of the mugs over to Star to smell and drink at her leisure. "Hot chocolate and a starry night, used to be the best to think through things."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wasn't expecting much to happen through the night. So to her surprise, the knight arriving with hot cocoa and a path to the roof of the inn? If not just because she wanted to do as Ellesandra asked unless she had reason not to, the curiosity of it all was enough to motivate her to join along. Her hair was still a bit damp from the shower, given how long and thick it was, but it wouldn't be a risk of a chill even at night. The nights had been warm lately. So when the two arrived on the roof and Star was able to secure a seat next to the knight, she had a small smile. She looked into her hot cocoa. The answers weren't there, but that didn't stop her from looking for them. "...Thoughtful as ever," she said quietly. The proximity almost ensured that Ellesandra would hear, but she was speaking to herself. Then, she spoke to Ellesandra directly. "I appreciate this. And I won't say that the company and ambiance doesn't help, because it does...But it's not really a matter of thinking things through for me. I promised I'd be okay, didn't I? I'm...Okay."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's anxiety seemed to spike a little when Star said she didn't have things to think through. She took a deep breath, closing her eyes and letting the anxiety flow through her for a moment. She hadn't really let herself think about this idea, not until she was sitting on the roof. Star needed to talk though, and this was going to be the only way Ellesandra could do so. He mug was brought up and sipped at, silently staring off across the roof tops tops before she responded. "I didn't bring you out here to do the thinking, Star." She settled with her feet placed flat on the roofing, knees up and arms partially wrapped around them, hugging them up close to her chest. The mug sat atop them while she looked anywhere but at Star, her jaw working from an obviously tense and nervous demeanor. "You obviously need to talk about something. You're afraid that it'll cause an argument, or you'll get shut down by me. But this helps me, so let's talk. What's on your mind?" It might not be Ellesandra throwing the door open for Star to come in, but at the very least, the window was cracked.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was surprised by the answer. But she smiled. It made sense, now. It was good, actually. Comforting, more than words could be, to see Ellesandra actually caring about their own emotions to some degree. Even if it was just seeking a little comfort for themselves. She looked up at the sky when the question was turned to her. "...More than you could possibly know. More than you'll be comfortable talking about, that's for sure," she said, though it was with an easy tone. One that accepted the reality, while still being happy for this chance. "...What you said at breakfast bothers me more than anything. More than you could have ever thought it would, I'd wager, else you wouldn't have said it. That you think of your wounds as mistakes, to start. I'm sure you could take a hardline thought to it and say that every single time you are wounded is somehow a mistake, somehow your fault, but to think that requires the belief that you're somehow possessed by wisdom and intelligence enough to perfectly predict every situation and every attack at all times, all the time. A mistake has to be reasonable in the moment, not just in hindsight. People don't often make mistakes intentionally, after all. It's why they're called mistakes." She paused here to sip her cocoa. "...But it's not like I'm upset at you because of poor grammar or something, this isn't some...Literary lecture." A smile, as she looked at her cocoa again. "It upsets me for two reasons. First being that if you were to tell me you're not giving it your all, that you're keeping a cool head and doing all you can to come out on top of the fights you get into, I'd be tempted to slap you for lying to both of us. The bravery I've seen you hold, the fearlessness, it's second to none. Not that you're impervious, I'm sure. But it's inspiring how you give it your all." Another pause. "...I'm not dumb though. It's not like I can't...Piece together some of the things you've said, connect some dots. Figure out with the insights that I have that the guilt you definitely don't feel because it doesn't exist and the frustrations you express about mistakes, how you clearly view it as some failing on your part, the handkerchief you aren't carrying around, and the thing you didn't blurt out to me when we got emotional back in Morrun's place...I don't know anything for sure, but it certainly gives me a few things to guess about what didn't happen, because nothing happened." Another pause for sipping her cocoa. "And because it all ties together, because this isn't about one single thing, but just how one word was the straw that broke the camel's back and put it all into context...That's why I thought it better to just not talk about it. I don't...Want to upset you. And if it requires me being upset so you don't have to be, well...That's kinda where it leads into my second point." Though what that second point was, she clearly was leaving until after Ellesandra had a chance to respond. Or not respond. "Just gonna throw out there that I recognize that was...A lot, all at once. And also gonna throw out that you asked for it," she said, smiling softly.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't answer while Star laid out all of her thoughts. About the comment from this morning, about how she'd connected it with the other things Ellesandra had said. Honestly, Ellesandra had assumed Star had made some of these connections even prior to that comment, but if that's what had made her close up, to get so introspective, then maybe Ellesandra was right in not sharing what had happened. Star didn't even know the entirety of it, and was just guessing at it. The anxiety mixed into some of the guilt that still existed as Star continued, but surprisingly there wasn't the same level of grief as there had been other times Star had approached the topic. No, there was still grief and sadness, but the other night of sobbing had seemed to do a large amount in helping relieve that load. She sipped at her drink again, letting silence build once Star was done. Her fingers tightened and then loosened, then tightened again around her mug while she considered what to say. There was twice that she opened her mouth, but nothing came out and she closed it again. She instead let the night air surround her, the smell of the evening and cocoa mixed, the sound of night creatures far off in the distance on the outside of town. It was still, with most people having been in their rooms or houses, and only some generic noise coming from the Inn below them. Finally, Ellesandra spoke. "Simply because someone is trying does not mean it's not still a mistake. A controllable one, no not necessarily. But it can still be a mistake. And you're closer to the truth than you think, though I'm not sure you can tell the extent of it." It was vague, but an answer - a confirmation for Star. There was something there, and she was close to figuring out what happened. Ellesandra ran a hand through her wet hair and snagged at the ponytail, mindlessly pulling the band off and letting her long hair flow down her back instead. "There are other mistakes that are undoubtedly mistakes though. Done in fits of rage, seeking revenge; not ones that you would argue weren't mistakes. Carelessness and recklessness." The movement was subtle, but her head lightly tilted to her right arm. "And those effect everything afterwards. The consequences of them effect my fighting. So, if I get hurt and you need to take that injury from me, it's a direct consequence of a mistake." She took another sip, then turned and gave Star a look, knowing damn well Star wasn't going to just accept that as truth or an excuse not to let Star heal her. "I was serious, that if it is something that needs to be done, I'll allow it. But otherwise, I'm not comfortable with it. I -" She paused and there was, out of nowhere, a sudden spike in the grief. Her throat closed and she closed her mouth, knowing she wouldn't get another word out right then. The grief and guilt twirled for a moment while she looked away again, forcing more hot cocoa down to try to calm herself. It didn't work, not entirely, but enough that she could finish the sentence. "I deserve the injury, if I let myself get injured. Not you."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star remained calm in the face of Ellesandra's response. Where she might have previously stubbornly fought back and insisted, she just...Listened. "I have confidence that I have a vague idea of what didn't happen. I've avoided saying much about it, but from the moment I saw you, the very first moment, I could infer a lot. It's my gift, after all. That under your calm demands to the pirates, there was grief and guilt. A wounded heart. It was of course not until you outright told me, in perhaps not so many words, the source of it that I could really understand. Just understand that as much as I'm gifted in seeing emotion, that gift doesn't do all the work. I've had to learn to read between the lines of the things people say. Pick up on the little head nods towards wounded arms that people show me and connect the dots. Speculate on whether a scar on someone's back is from a sword or a whip from just a single glance at it. But, circling back to the first point a little.." She paused to take another sip. "Intent is very much what differentiates a degree of a mistake. If you walk into someone's house and bump a priceless vase and knock it over and it breaks, well...That's an accident. If you show remorse, if you explain how you didn't mean for that to happen, well...It matters. It doesn't un-break the vase, but...It matters. Sure as heck makes the response from the owner of the vase less hostile than if you walked in and grabbed the vase with a big sadistic grin on your face and spiked it at your feet then stomped on the fragments. Or if you just shrugged and coldly told them to not leave vases by the doorway. Just like how fighting with your all, and despite your best efforts still getting wounded is different than intentionally standing there and letting someone hurt you because you feel like you deserve to be punished." She let those words linger for a moment. "You're right that I don't know all that happened to you. That I don't know the context. And you don't have to tell me. I won't ask. But I'll remind you that I want to know. More than my calm words can convey, I want to know. But I want to respect your boundaries more. So...That's where that ends unless you decide otherwise." Another sip. "...We can all be careless and reckless sometimes. I'm not saying we're absolved of the consequences of our failures by our good intentions. But just as I said before...There has to be some allowance for us. We are, none of us, perfect. And I'm sure if I were to turn this on you instead, you'd find every excuse to try to absolve me. Or perhaps you wouldn't. So...Let me ask you rather than assume." She looked at Ellesandra again. "...If I find my mother dead, what should I feel? I told you what happened. I told you that, in the moment, perhaps I could have taken my mother with me, or insisted she come. Perhaps that could have saved her life. By not doing so, perhaps I allowed the fear I felt to stop me from intervening in what could very well have been the moment that sealed my mother's fate. So it's a direct result of my inaction." Another pause. A softer, slightly more serious tone then came from her, then. This question was important to her, even as it was left prefaced to some degree as a trap for Ellesandra to either agree with Star and acknowledge their own hypocrisy in excusing another's actions but not their own, or condemn Star to the same grief: "Should my mother's demise weigh on my shoulders, Ellesandra?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
What was she supposed to say? As Star continued speaking, Ellesandra just sipped until her cocoa was gone, and then she sat the mug to the side. She wrapped her arms around her knees entirely now, hugging them up close to her chest, and looking out over the town. Star wasn't entirely right, not with everything she said. Ellesandra hadn't just stood there and let someone stab her because she felt like she deserved it. Though - a twinge of pain came back up as she remembered what happened after all of it. And how she had, indeed, just taken her punishment without complaint. She let out a deep breath, lowering her forehead to her knees and working to push that feeling back down, the memory of her Marigold's parents. The silence stretched again, after Star posed the question to Ellesandra. How would respond to that? Ellesandra didn't move, considering. Moments passed, and then she turned her head to look at Star. "No one 'should' feel anything. You feel what you feel. How I would respond to the situation, were I to have a mother who encouraged me to run and I did so, I am sure I would handle that differently than you did. Any feeling you have there isn't inherently wrong, nor would mine be if I were in that situation." She paused, and then turned again, resting her chin on her knees and looking out over the sea. "I can't relate to being close to a mother, Star. But if I had one, if I loved her. I would feel guilty. I would feel guilty for leaving, even if I knew it was the best move right then. Staying would have distracted her, whereas leaving gave her a fighting chance. Guilty but hopeful. If she ended up dead, I would feel grief. Sorrow. Probably anger, a lot of it. Both at her for taking that choice away from me, and whoever did it to her. And if any of those are as overwhelming as...other things I've felt, I'd deal with them the only way I could while staying sane. While moving on." She looked back to Star now, her words dropping into a whisper. "I'd pretend it didn't happen."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't looked upset by the answer. She'd been exposed enough to Ellesandra's way of things to know vaguely what to expect. "Pretend it didn't happen but punish yourself for all of it anyway, you mean," she said with a calm smile. She mirrored Ellesandra's posture with legs hugged up to her chest, though she held onto her cocoa. "And hey, looks like you're not half bad at this empathy thing too. You know what it was like for me without me having said a thing about it. Guilty, but hopeful. Grief, sorrow, and anger...I've already had a lot of that over this, but plenty more waits if I find her dead, yes. But I can't do what you do, I'm afraid. Not that I would want to. It might have worked for you to some measure, but as an expert in emotions let me tell you that all you've done is ignore a festering wound. No more can you pretend this doesn't exist than you could a necrotic foot. That is to say, you can say you pretend it doesn't hurt all you want, but you're just lying to both of us." She kept a smile as she said these words. She had accepted Ellesandra for this, even if she clearly, very obviously, disagreed. "But I find it illuminating how easily you can apply nuance and judgement to the situation when your focus of your frame of mind is me, and not you. It's not to say that I'm assuming you don't have valid reasons to feel all these feelings that you do. Of course not. Like you said...You feel what you feel." She looked at Ellesandra here, meeting their gaze. "And you're going to feel it no matter how hard you try not to. And it's sat inside you, slowly chipping away at you. Poisoning you from the inside. Leading you to conclusions you truly believe...But I know for certain you would never tolerate coming out of my mouth. Things like...How you deserve to be hurt. How you deserve the injury, not me. And I could argue with you as the night is long...That you wouldn't suffer the wound if not for you needing to protect me, that it is, pragmatically, the best choice given your resistance to regular magic and it allows me more mana to do other things that are useful on the battlefield and that by not permitting it you are directly contributing to mistakes that can lead to even worse consequences - by your own logic, of course. But as I've said...I don't want to argue. All I can do is share with you what I see, and what I feel. So...Whether you want to sit with those words and say nothing, or talk about them some more, or something else entirely...There's something a little unrelated I'd like to share with you. If you'll let me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
That didn't seem fair. The defensiveness rose, but she didn't say anything. She held her response back, pressing her lips together. There was a difference between pretending a physical ailment wasn't there and an emotional one. She also had never said she'd deserved an injury in the line of protecting Star. If she got the injury in a fight, she deserved to get it because she'd been careless. Not because of any self-punishing thing - at least not consciously. The thoughts ran through her mind, but she prevented herself from saying them. Doing so really would lead into an argument with Star, which was exactly what Star had wanted to avoid. They simply didn't agree on these topics, and Ellesandra didn't think trying to explain her side would convince Star otherwise at all. So after a few moments of sitting with those thoughts but not speaking them, she just turned to look at Star and nodded. "Go ahead." Permission to discuss whatever was unrelated that was on Star's mind with a head nod, pushing the previous conversation to the back of her mind.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took the silence for what it was. The topic drew too close to disagreements. She could see the frustration and defensiveness. Star's view on emotions was naturally a deeper one than most, and with that came a reverence for them, and what led her to liken them to physical wounds. To her, they were fundamentally similar. But rather than say anything, she extended a hand to Ellesandra. "...Not words, but...A memory. A happy one. I figured we'd get here eventually if you insisted I share what was on my mind. So I came prepared to...Hopefully share with you something sweet. Something to give us a smile for the night."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She frowned at the idea of a memory being shared. What did Star mean? Just that she was going to talk about it? But then her eyes fell to Star's hand, extended to her, and she remembered Star mentioning she could see memories in some people. And apparently share them that way as well. There was obvious distrust and caution come up, a fear that Star would somehow be able to reverse it and see Ellesandra's own memories. Did she want her to see those? Very much not, even if sharing them would make it easier than trying to explain them. She stared at that hand for a few moments, unconsciously reaching for her empty mug and trying to take a sip. It was gone, but it was the action that helped soothe the anxiety. With a deep breath, they reached out and took Star's hand, nodding. Not that she felt like she needed to experience a sweet smiling memory from Star, but that if it would help Star feel better she would comply.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star knew there was distrust. But it only reinforced the notion that she had to ensure Ellesandra felt that this was not an invasion of their privacy, but her opening up to them more. Not that Star was really closed off. But whether she could or not turn this on Ellesandra and jump through their memories was unknown, and the knight would have to believe either she couldn't, or that she wouldn't do it. One a matter of limitation, the other a matter of trust. Time would tell. But when Ellesandra took her hand, her aura blossomed off her again. It washed over Ellesandra, bringing a sense of serenity to them. It beckoned them to ease their eyes closed. Not forced, just...Soothed towards closing their eyes to share in the memory. And the memory that followed was one of Star and her mother. The viewpoint was from beyond. Like an unseen eye peering through the veil. Star was a small child. And it would be the first view Ellesandra would get of Star's mother. White hair, though slightly less snow-white than Star's. A bit more silvery. Eyes were also a slightly greener tint of blue, in contrast with Star's vibrantly blue irises. But the familial resemblance was more than obvious. Aurora. This was Aurora Lumina. A mature woman. The motherly gaze with which she gazed at Star spoke of the family bond enough without the resemblance. Little Star was still quite young in this memory. Big, twin braids flopped behind her as she ran into what looked to be the main living area of their home. Aurora was sitting upon the couch. The house was cozy. A little rustic. The furnishing weren't royal, but they were made with care. Aurora had a book in hand, but smiled as Star ran into the room. "Hello there my little twinkle-toes," said Aurora, her words adoring and loving through and through. Star giggle. "Mommaaaaaa! Sir. Bakersman came to visit! Come see, come see!" she insisted. Aurora smiled and set their book aside, then stood to follow Star as Star tugged her mother along to another room. Star then adorably began to mantle on a chair and then up onto the counter to kneel on the counter of what looked to be the kitchen and out the circular window. The vision shifted to behind their heads to reveal that Sir. Bakersman was...A squirrel. Aurora smiled, leaning slightly down to peer out the window with her child. Then, she reached forward to unlatch the window and pull it open. Aurora's aura then blossomed off her. Aurora's aura was similar, yet different to Star's. Tighter. More purposeful. More refined. More powerful. Controlled, though it retained its ethereal wispiness to it. Aurora extended a hand out. The squirrel hopped onto Aurora's hand from the tree branch that it was perched upon, crossing the small gap to land on Aurora's hand to sit in her palm. There was a trust in the body language of the animal. Aurora then pulled the squirrel in a little to let them down on the counter. "Now stay there a moment, Sir. Bakersman. Star, why don't you entertain him for a moment? I'll get him a tasty nut for his travels," she said, earning an enthused giggle and set of nods from Star. Star then set about petting the squirrel, who seemed calm as could be as she did so. "I know you've got a lot to do, Sir. Bakersman, so it is with great uhm...Great...Res...Uhm...Great happiness that you are welcomed!" she said with a giggle and kept about petting the animal. "Momma says if I keep trying, I'll figure out how to talk to you. You two better not be discussing my birthday surprise in secret! You gotta promise you aren't telling momma all my secrets, 'cause I showed you my diary in confidence! Mhm, mhm!" As Star had her fun, Aurora did leave and indeed return with a handful of nuts from their pantry. Aurora held them out for Star. Star examined them, plucking an acorn from the mixed pile and smiled as she offered it to the squirrel, who naturally took it and then turned to skitter away with the prize. Star giggled some more, so full of childish mirth. She then took the rest of the nuts and put them by the window. "Gotta leave the window open, 'cause what if he is still hungry later? I'll leave him a little pile to come back to." Aurora chuckled. "Are we just gonna invite the whole forest into our kitchen, my little sparkle?" she asked as she picked Star up to hold in her arms. She then shut the window and latched it while holding her daughter. "It'll be good practice for your aura sense. You know what Sir. Bakersman's aura feels like. So if you feel him come around again, you let me know and we'll make sure he has all he needs, okay?" she said, earning some enthused nods from Star. The two then moved back to the living room and Aurora sat down again, setting Star on her lap. Star then moved to lay down across her mother's lap, possessed by a warm smile. Aurora gently stroked Star's head, smiling. "I love you, Star. I always will." And with those words, the dream faded to white, returning Star and Ellesandra to their night atop the inn.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was definitely a happy memory, a cheery one that she was sure Star remembered fondly when thinking of her mother. Ellesandra's own reaction to it was bittersweet. A happiness for Star, to see how happy and loved she'd been by her mother, but there was also...envy. Disappointment. A feeling of missing out on these types of moments herself. It wasn't that she'd not had anyone to care for her as a kid, once she was taken in, but those who were her guardian's weren't...parents. At least not hers. They supported her, encouraged her to get better and find a career, but love her? Nothing like this. So while she pulled away from the memory, smiling softly to Star but pulling her hand away before any of her own memories that had come to the surface could flow back into Star, her own memory of the last time she'd seen the one who might be considered the closest thing to Ellesandra's mother came through her. There was shame, mostly of herself, and she pushed the memory away before she could relive too much of it. Before Star would feel bad for sharing such a pleasant memory of her mother, or see the reactions Ellesandra would certainly have to her own memory. "She obviously loved you. What ever became of Sir Bakersman? Did he come back and get more nuts?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see it. Despite not seeing the memory, she could still see Ellesandra's emotions. She knew this was possible. That she'd be, to some degree, shoving Ellesandra's face in how close she was with her mother. Not the intent in the slightest, no. But she was sympathetic all the same. She wore that sympathy in her eyes as she looked at her companion. She hugged her legs, leaning her head on them, turned towards Ellesandra. She smiled. "He did. Paw-paw'd at the window since they were right there in sight. I didn't sense him coming that day, but I got better at it. I just wanted to share that with you...Because now you know what she looks like. What she sounds like. And...Maybe gives you a bit of a better understanding of why it's so important to me that I do what I do. I know that...things weren't so easy for you. I remember you told me you were an orphan. You probably didn't need a reason or any reinforcement about what this means to me but...I hope you enjoyed it at least half as much as I do thinking back on it." She was a little misty-eyed, though it wasn't as easy to spot in the moonlight. "I won't bridge off that to talk about you, much as I do want to know more about your childhood and past and...The people you've cared about through the years. I just wanted to share that sliver of my happiness with you tonight." She sniffled. "I really love her, too. I really miss her."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She smiled at the idea of a squirrel pawing at a window to be let in to get nuts. As well as a child Star excitedly looking out for him to come pet him and feed him. A nod was given in regards to the information about her mother, turning back away from Star and staring out into the night once more. She was silent, not knowing how to respond as Star brought up her childhood, even if she reinforced that it wasn't intended as a bridge to talk about Ellesandra. The sniffling got to her, a weakness in seeing someone cry, to where Ellesandra scooted closer to Star and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. There were no words - what was she going to say, 'yeah I know you love her and miss her'? What benefit would that have? Instead, if Star accepted that touch, she'd continue looking out into the sea that could be seen across the horizon, the ships that were in dock right now. Her mind flitted through different things in her childhood, before things had gone wrong and soured her view of it all. There were few things she could think about or share without Marigold being involved, since Marigold had been such a large part of her life for essentially all of Ellesandra's memory, but eventually she did think of one that she thought could be shared. "After I was found, outside a burned down building that they assume my parents had died in, I was taken in by a very well to do family." She started off, chewing on her lip and intentionally keeping things very vague. She didn't want to go into too much detail about any of it, since it would beg questions. Keeping it vague felt like an obvious boundary. "Well to do enough that they had a personal swords trainer on staff, and I remember sitting on a bale of hay in the training grounds. I must have been - five, six? And this woman, I've never admired someone so. She was an Acolyte of Torm, having left his temples to serve the family of her partner. Best fighter I've ever seen, even to this day. I don't think I ever, even as I came into my own in training, landed a blow she didn't intentionally leave open to test my awareness. Black and grey, salt and pepper colored short cut hair, for a while in my teens I tried to emulate her with the short hair because my admiration had turned into a little bit of hero worship and attraction for your teacher, situation. Didn't really fit me, though." She reached up, running a finger through her hair briefly. Her own round face didn't fit the style of a short cut military style; her face was too 'cute', and not quite as sharp or strong as her teacher's had been. "I don't remember a mother, not like the mother you had. Those who took me in provided a purpose, a shelter and food, but they weren't parents." She said this with a shrug. That part had never bothered her; she'd never sought that type of affection from them. Well, it hadn't until the last few days she'd seen them. She hadn't realized just how little they'd thought of her. The shame came back, but she forced it down again. "So her, she would probably be the closest thing I have to a mom, a mom like yours anyways." A snort came out of nowhere. "Not that she'd ever deign to let me lay my head in her lap. She would have slapped my ass and told me if I had time to lay against her I had time to work on my stance. But it was always done with the goal of improvement because she wanted to ensure I could protect myself. A genuine caring, in her own way."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was once more a little surprised, but not unpleasantly so, to have Ellesandra scoot over and loop an arm around her. It brought a smile to her lips. She might sniffle, but her face wrote how touched she was all across her features. It was a small gesture, but an important one for Star. Physical touch was important to her. A manifestation of a bond between two people. She leaned into the touch, into the hold. Not a peep was heard from the empath while Ellesandra spoke. Just a series of warm smiles that brightened across her lips at various points in the story. There was some darkness on her features at the notion that Ellesandra had caretakers, not parents. A parent didn't need to be blood. But it sounded like love was a scarce resource in Ellesandra's home. All that did was quietly give Star resolve to ensure that Ellesandra felt her care as their friend. More so when seeing the shame rising in Ellesandra. She didn't comment, but it remained tucked away with the many insights she had about the woman that she held in her heart with the hope of someday, somehow, giving Ellesandra something to smile about. A smile so wide and so genuine that it brought them to tears. Yes. That was a fine dream to hold onto. Something that only reinforced her desire, her drive, to keep Ellesandra close. They might be her guardian for now...But no matter what fate had in store for them, she wanted to ensure beyond all doubt that she and Ellesandra would never forget one another, and smile when they thought of one another. "Everyone shows love in different ways," she said quietly, smiling. "I like hearing about people who made you smile. About people who cared about you." She left out her thoughts on the matter that the knight sounded to be severely lacking in people like that in their life. "She raised a fine knight. Finer than any I've ever met, certainly. And I have indeed met my share."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't really look at Star much during her story, so she wasn't seeing how her smile spread at different parts of her story. The idea of telling Star about people who made her smile though brought back memories of the only one who had done so consistently, and that just sent a shock of pain through her system. She did make a dismissive, disagreeing hum at the fine knight comment as well, trying to play off the pain she was sure Star had seen briefly as disagreement about whether she was a fine knight. Ellesandra was certain that her old mentor would be ashamed to claim her as a student. She hadn't seen her mentor after the incident and before she left, but Ellesandra knew - or at least she thought she did. In reality, she'd have been welcomed with open arms if she'd gone to her mentor, but Ellesandra had not been in a mental state to believe or do that. She still wasn't. "So, there." Ellesandra said, clearing her throat of the memory of one more thing she'd lost. She once again pulled her knees up to her chest, and sidled a little bit away from Star. This time it wasn't a matter of wanting distance, but that after a moment Ellesandra laid back on the roof and spread her arms out, staring up into the night sky. "Don't expect stories like that often." She warned, not wanting this to be a precedent set where Star would expect Ellesandra to open up about things from her childhood or past.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept her posture, despite the flicker of desire to mirror Ellesandra and lay next to them. That brought a momentary...Weird feeling in her chest that was gone again before she could focus on it and put any meaning to it. So she just stayed where she was, knees held to her chest. Maybe she just needed this self-comfort. She looked up at the stars some more as well, all the same. "I don't hold any expectations. Just hopes," she said with a soft giggle under her breath. "Just for the record, I don't mind sharing. I know you're a private person. I respect that. But you don't have to treat me as you want me to treat you in this respect. I'm sure it's not the same for you but...I like to relive memories. Good, and bad. I like to share myself with the people I care about." Ellesandra was obviously the subject of this, though she kept it general to avoid pointing a spotlight on the knight. "So don't be afraid to ask, if you ever find yourself curious. If it helps your pragmatic mind, maybe you can just think of it like...Understanding the details of the mission. Fishing for clues." She giggled. "Might be something relevant in my stories that I just hadn't considered. Definitely not me making up excuses to give us more to talk about, ehe.~"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Hopes. Ellesandra had to resist rolling her eyes at this. Why would anyone hope that Ellesandra revealed more about herself? It wasn't like her past was pleasant, a good story to listen to. She wasn't one of those adventurers who would go to a tavern and tell tales of their exploits all through the realm. There was no comment though as Star extended the offer to open it up on her own side, even the implication that she cared for Ellesandra. Which was ludicrous, considering they'd only known eachother for a few days - most people didn't learn to care about anyone that quickly. Was it this resonance thing, or whatever harmony it was? She shook her head, finding herself smiling in amusement at Star's giggling and ending 'ehe'. "You don't need my permission to talk about yourself, Star." She opened her mouth, about to add 'as long as you understand it might not be reciprocated', but stopped and closed her mouth. That boundary had already been drawn, multiple times. Star knew, and shoving her face in it when Star wasn't pushing wasn't going to do any favors for them getting along. So, she closed her mouth and settled back into the roof, repositioning so that the wooden slat beneath her wasn't pressing into her shoulder uncomfortably. "Don't just randomly send me memories though, please. I'd like warning before that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled, unseen to the woman laying beside her as she kept her gaze forward and upward. "You sure do live by a strict set of rules, don't you?" she asked, perhaps rhetorically. "I'm not asking permission. I can say whatever I want, whenever I want. But just because I can talk about something, doesn't mean you want to hear it." She looked over her shoulder to smile at Ellesandra. "If you don't want to know anything about me, hear anything about me, there's not much reason for me to talk about it, is there?" Another question that seemed rhetorical, meant just to make her point than to actually demand an answer from the knight. She turned her eyes over to the water, then. "I'm not sure where you get this idea of me that I'm purposefully going to trample over every boundary between our emotional selves. Believe it or not, I care very much about preserving the privacy of peoples' emotions. Which might sound a bit strange, since I can see everyone's emotions," she said with a giggle. "But I can't help that much. What I can help is what I do with that knowledge. And of course, what I always want to do is help people. And sometimes that means putting a bold step forward, but...Most of what I see in others, I keep to myself. There's something I do with others, once in a while. I can bridge my aura to another person and temporarily let them see what I see. And if you ever did want to see the world through my eyes, you might understand a little more what I mean. The world is always alive, always brimming with colour. But I've never done that with someone I am resonant with, obviously. So better to just leave that as a...Thing to ponder for a while, maybe never to do." It wasn't like Star to shy away from something like this; she had said herself she enjoyed being open. And that she had shared this connection of her sight with others in the past. It was perhaps the first time it was Star being hesitant about sharing some part of herself, regardless of what Ellesandra thought about it. "Sorry. Rambling...I just was trying to say I'm not going to go doing what you said. I'd never want to bridge our auras without your consent. I want to respect your boundaries as much as I'm physically able to. It's just harder to do with you than it has been with anyone else. I'm sorry that that is how it is. I know it frustrates you."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra almost laughed at the rules. Rules helped her with a lot of things, helped her socially anxious ass know what was appropriate in certain situations. The rhetorical question was nonetheless answered with her shaking her head. Still, the discussion of not walking over Ellesandra's boundaries made her roll over to her side, watching Star curiously. She had a thoughtful expression on her face as she did, letting silence fill the air for a few moments after Star's comment about allowing Ellesandra to see things Star did, before she answered. "I wouldn't want to do that. It's not that I distrust you, specifically, Star in that you would intentionally bulldoze through the boundary I've tried to create, or that others do. I find your power, inherently, invasive." She took a breath, shaking her head. "I know you can't control it, and that you're doing your best to do so when we touch, but if the shadow is right that's especially hard to do with me because of whatever resonance or harmony we have together." She waved her hand, waving off the more technical explanation and just assuming Star would follow along with it. "At first, I was afraid you were going to just ignore my wish and decide that you were too curious not to. And that you'd hide behind the guise of wanting to help me because I'm in pain or something like that. I don't think that anymore, I know you wouldn't intentionally do anything like that. But your power is hard to control with me, and even if it's not your fault I don't feel comfortable with that. So when I reaffirm my boundary, know that I'm not criticizing you. It's honestly more for my benefit than anything, and I recognize that it's not something you can control when you do that. It's also why I would never want to use your power to see other's aura's like you do. I find it invasive to them even if they're open to it, and I can control it by not taking you up on the offer."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded along with the knight's explanation. "In this case, I think you're right to worry it would be difficult to maintain that boundary in such a case. And I try to realize you're not criticizing me. I try. But there's part of me that can't help but feel rejected for something I can't control." She shook her head. "That's equally not your fault. It's just completely different from what I was used to growing up. With my mother, we could hold each other any time and there was this...Unspoken way we could communicate, since we share the same gift. There's nothing as comforting to me as being able to do that with someone, even if I know it would be a lot to task of even a generally open person." Read: Not you, Ellesandra. "I obviously had to learn to have trust people at their word, read context, all of that. But as much as my gift is something I consider a blessing, it hasn't come without its struggles. It's...Hard to put into words what the anxiety can be like sometimes. I see anxieties in other people and they can be strong, yes. But it's not quite the same anxiety that I feel needing to trust in the unknown, instead of being allowed to hold someone and let our hearts connect. It's so much harder to convey how I feel to other people with words." She paused a moment. "...I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm just doing my best. And no matter how strongly I feel that that connection I can have with someone because of my gift is a beautifully special thing, it won't stop me from acknowledging that you feel the way you feel, and that your views are as they are. This whole subject just has put this...Longing in my heart. So I apologize in advance if I'm sounding a little more sentimental than usual." She then smiled and threw out a distraction before Ellesandra could properly reply to any of that, giving them an out to just move on from it all without a word: "...The stars are bright tonight. Beautifully so."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She listened, not quite sure what to say to what Star was sharing. It might not come as a surprise to anyone, but Ellesandra wasn't good at these types of conversations even at the best of times. She could tell when someone needed comfort, but she wasn't always good at giving it, as seen by the simple hug that was done awkwardly and uncomfortable occasionally. Verbal comfort? Ellesandra was bad at it. She wasn't the type to just agree with someone and vent about something, talk about boys or girls you were interested in and complain how they were dumb dumbs for not being interested in you back. With the topic change to the Stars, a thought flitted through Ellesandra's mind. Her eyes ran up and down Star's back, knowing that if Star were not a client, her charge, she would probably have made the comment that came to her. That at least one Star was particularly beautiful that night. She refrained, however. Flirting with a charge was a good way to get herself hurt again, and upset a client most likely, considering Ellesandra had no intention of opening up to a lover. And Star very much did not seem the type to be able to have a night of passion and then act like nothing happened the next day. So, without comment she turned to her back and stared up at the sky again, grunting softly in agreement. "I've looked at the stars more in the past few nights than I have in years." She commented, considering. She normally didn't bother looking up at the sky, not unless she thought there might be danger coming from it or anything.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a calm silence that overtook Star for a moment. Something pensive. Something that suggested she was retreating inwards again. Then she just shook her head for seemingly no reason, then eased back to lay down, hands folded on her middle. "There might not be answers among them...But they've always inspired me. Kinda lame, isn't it? That me, with my name, of all people, would feel that way?" A small giggle. "But it is who I am. And if there is one thing I am good at it's...Being completely, unashamedly...Me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra scrunched her face up in confusion. "Why would it be lame? Your family has history with celestial objects, apparently naming children like that. Your mother being named Aurora doesn't make it lame for her to enjoy looking at Aurora's, does it?" She shrugged, considering back to her childhood when she cared if people thought she was lame. These days, being called lame wouldn't bother her at all. Lame was safe, expected, predictable. The only part of her that she didn't want to be predictable was her fighting, or her work guarding someone. If she was too predictable there, it could get a charge in trouble or in danger. Everything else? What other people thought of it didn't matter; they couldn't think any less of her than she already did. "Did your family have any stories in regards to the stars, or things as such? I've heard some religions tend to dedicate certain constellations to their deities and attribute the creation of such to them, though I'm not sure how much I believe that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star just smiled and laughed under her breath. She didn't really have an answer as to why it was lame other than just the connection between name and object. Did one cause the other? Or was her mother just astute and felt some energy, some feeling that she would feel this way? She hoped she might be able to ask her mother someday. She still hoped they were out there. "I remember the first time she showed me an aurora, to explain what she was named after. I asked her if that was the aura of the world," she said with a giggle. "Auroras look a lot like what I see around people. Some people are more colourful than others. Everyone's aura is unique. So when I saw it in the sky, I thought it might be a glimpse about how the sky felt, and I just couldn't reach out and feel it yet. Unfortunately, that was just me being a silly little girl. As for stories? There's one." She paused a moment, recalling the story. "...My mother told me about one star in the sky, something she called the star of guiding silver and purest white. A star that shone only once every thousand years. A star that, if it hung high in the sky, could be called upon to shine down a healing light upon the one who beseeched it. The silvery white light of the star could cure the worst curses, the deepest wounds. It could comfort the greatest sadness and banish darkness wherever it shone." She paused another moment. "There was...A great, terrible war in my homeland long ago. The story goes that there was a man of the most vile hatred for life that he saw fit to exterminate everyone under the guise of a promised ascension to something greater than themselves. But being so charismatic as he was, he rallied cultists under his rule to spread across the three realms of my homeland, plunging everything into war. Each innocent slain rose again to serve under the army of the Grand Magician, Faust. A darkness that spread across the land so dark that it threatened to snuff out all life. But on one fateful night, my mother told of a story that she was passed from her mother, and to them from their mother, going back as far as anyone can remember, that one night when all seemed at its darkest, the white-silver star shone in the sky. And from the heavens descended the savior of the realms, who we know only as Silent Purity. An angel, with wings of purest alabaster, a sword that shone light bright enough to banish darkness across the plane of Sun, Moon, and Star in one glorious thrust to the sky, and a mask over their face. Never to speak a word under an oath of silence. And this is a story known all through my homeland; the scars of this war remain in some places even to this day, unless a great deal has changed since I was separated from it. But most who tell the story simply say the angel came down on just some fated night. It is only when my mother told it to me that she said Silent Purity brought with her the white-silver star from the heavens, plucking it from its home in the sky for when the land needed it most to shine amidst her golden halo as she banished the darkness. Ultimately...The story concludes not with a righteous salvation, but sacrifice. That Silent Purity held high the white-silver star, but that Faust dragged Silent Purity with him to his grave. That she saved the land, but had known from the moment she descended from the heavens she knew her fate was to die for us all. So...As you can expect, there is a fair amount of reverence for her that lived on. Statues built in her image, some who worship her. But it was all supposedly a thousand years ago or so. So I imagine the devotion these days is much less than it was in the era where the realm rebuilt itself after the catastrophe."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra listened raptly. She didn't watch Star, instead eyes gazing across the many speckles of light in the night sky, but she fully paid attention to the story. It was hard not to relate the story to those she knew as a kid, most closely to Torm himself and his sacrifice as well as the sacrifice of the thousands of mortals who supposedly gave their souls to empower Torm. And his resurrection, which she had fond memories of celebrating. They were some of the few times that she spent away from Marigold, and though she still had bitter sweet memories with her mentor during such celebrations, there were many in which Ellesandra lost herself to drink, food, and the pleasures of a night's company during them. Not as many as she would have liked, before she was fully turned away from the god. "Sometimes I wonder if all of the stories we hear about deities are really just one deity in different forms. So many of them are extremely similar to one another; are they making up stories of such because they know it works for us mortals to connect with them and believe in them more? Are they truly as similar to one another as they seem sometimes?" She shrugged, looking over to Star finally. "Silent Purity, though. Quite a name to have to live up to, with self-sacrifice. Certainly a worthy role model and someone to look up to as a child."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I don't have the answer to that. But if that's the case, this one god sure does like to fight with themselves. Bahumat and Tiamat. Selune and Shar. Lathander and Myrkul. Corellon and Lolth, and Gruumsh. Mystryl and Kozah. If you give me a few minutes to recall my lore, I'm sure I can come up with a whole lot more tales of gods who really, really don't like each other," she said with a giggle. "But, even that could be a manifestation. It's hard to...Know something." She paused again, donning another pensive expression. Something tinted slightly with sorrow. Her heart was reminded again of what it was like to connect with her mother and know the depths of the heart of the other. The longing ache returned. But she kept quiet about it. "What about you?" she asked, looking at Ellesandra again. "I would say I looked up to my mom more than Silent Purity. Did you have anyone you looked up to, besides that nameless trainer who would probably crack their whip at you for doing something so heinous as, ah...Relaxing on a rooftop instead of practicing your flourish?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She snorted at the idea of the god fighting amongst itself in different forms. "Maybe the deity is just bored so creates conflict with itself. Fighting can be fun if you've grown up with it your whole life, a sport really." She knew many a person who enjoyed the art of dueling for the enjoyment over it more than the utility and use it had in guarding or fighting for something. The comment about cracking the whip was something she had to actively force herself not to react to. The scars on her back seemed to tingle at the thought. Oh, her trainer hadn't been the one to cause them, hadn't been holding the whip, but it was too close for full comfort. Shaking her head and those thoughts out of it, she considered who she might have looked up to. Besides 'that nameless trainer.' "Her name is Sia. I only called her ma'am or ser, though." A moment of silence after as she considered who else she may have looked up to. At least, looked up to and was still comfortable talking about. "There was a soldier I served with for a time, Aeras. He was a true believer in Torm, a paladin. The most honorable man I've met; he would tell it to you straight and still make you feel grateful for him giving you brutal honesty. Truly wanted to help people in the world, and thought hiding things from them or being anything but truthful was, in the long run, more harmful than telling them the truth. I don't know how he did it, tell someone to their face they were an asshole and somehow make them thank him for being honest and never feel defensive." She shrugged lightly. "Last I heard, he'd died in battle against some beast that was prowling the beaches near the outskirts of the Kingdom. I mourned his loss, and celebrated his memory during The Divine Death ceremonies."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star noticed the reaction. Of course she hadn't intended it, but...Well, that did confirm that, didn't it? She made a mental note to not bring that up again. "Sia? That's a nice name," she said, unable to view the stern mentor with the same instilled fear, respect, or whatever kept Ellesandra in line. Sia hadn't yelled at Star to demand she call them 'ser' after all. A passing comment, before Ellesandra continued. "Paladins have that way about them. I knew a paladin before, a paladin of Arshea. She was...Eccentric. But kind." Once more, just an anecdote, not wishing to linger on herself, wishing to focus on the other instead. "I'm sorry to hear of his passing. It sounds like your homeland lost a good soul. Perhaps not the most gentle one, but I get the sense from the people you describe as looking up to, you have a lot of respect for strong personalities like yours." She smiled, truly meaning it in a good way. "I can't say I blame you of course. It's inspiring to see someone face things with fearlessness, to command others with strength of conviction." She was mostly thinking aloud with this, but focused back on the point by the end. "Have you ever been a leader to other soldiers? I can tell you're well used to being part of an organized plan with how you fit in with the elves, though with how you always spoke in common to them it makes me suspect you missed the speech that was given in elvish before we left the grove."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Sia was a nice name. For a while, Ellesandra had considered it for a child's name, if she ever had one. She no longer considered having a child as an option, though; no more dreams of settling down with someone and raising a family. She nodded at the comment about Paladins and their seeming natural charisma. She nodded softly to herself, not letting her mind stray near the only 'gentle' person she'd looked up to or truly respected. She didn't exist, after all. "Leader? Oh, no. I don't have the desire or drive to command others; the ability to command respect like that. I've never desired to be able to do so, either." She paused, reaching up to run fingers through her hair and scratch at her scalp lightly, thinking back to her early teens. "I did serve as a squire to a knight on a brief campaign. It was just to take out some bandits on the outskirts, we weren't a Kingdom at war or anything. I started squiring when I was about ten, with the goal of becoming a Knight, of course. So I have experience marching with them, travelling and how an army functions overall." That was what she'd been calling upon during the march with the elves, and her tendency to follow command when given. "As for language - no I don't speak anything but maybe one or two words in elven I've picked up during my travels. I did join a few lessons in Sylvan growing up, enough I could pass for a basic conversation, but I wouldn't be able to hold anything in depth or get nuances in it." She hadn't been particularly good at that, and did not want to delve into those particular memories. Marigold had dragged her to the lessons because she wanted someone to be able to practice with; Ellesandra's interest had always been much more in Marigold and much less in the actual Sylvan language. The memory stirred up some of the guilt and pain, but she quickly focused her mind elsewhere. Pretending it didn't exist, after all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept an eye on the way Ellesandra's emotions flashed through their explanation, as she often did. Polite eye contact was maintained all the time, though that naturally came with the obvious consequence. Star idly wondered if Ellesandra might consider it more polite if Star didn't look at them. Just...At all. Weird thought to put away. She found it odd, and her face shows as much, that Ellesandra had no desire for leadership. But with some short consideration, she surmised her own answer to why that might be. She didn't want to push it. It was nice to be on the receiving end of them opening up, even if it wasn't anything terribly personal. "I speak a lot of languages. They come pretty naturally to me, so, if you ever need a translator, I'm your girl," she said with a bright smile, not having any judgement for Ellesandra's lack of desire to learn them. Only one of them needed to speak any given language to get around, after all. "Was there anything else you had to learn in part of becoming a knight? Maybe it's a given, but I assume you're at home on horseback. But I don't really know what else you might learn outside of combat. Surely there's some other facets to it, no?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She didn't seem to notice Star's apparent thoughts. The eye contact did make her uncomfortable, in which she usually was not meeting it just from a habit of looking away while she spoke. The 'I'm your girl' comment made Ellesandra raise a single eyebrow at Star in amusement, but she didn't comment on it. Again, there would be no flirting with Star, even when Star made comments that left her wide open for it. Turning her mind back to her training, she sat up and took her empty mug, looking down into it as something to look at rather than the eye contact Star was making. "Well, fighting is an obvious one. Being able to put armor on and take it off quickly. Riding a horse, yes, as well as driving a carriage and wagon and such. Camp making, fires, setting up tents, how to live off of the gruel they serve when out on the road." She smirked at this, thinking back to some of the particularly bad meals that were served. Stew that was more water than anything else on particularly long trips. "Keeping an eye out while being on guard, how to sleep lightly to be woken easily but still get decent sleep. Along with that learning how to fall asleep almost instantly. Sometimes, you take the nap you can get. And then one specific to myself was studying some basic medicine; since healing magic didn't work well on me, I went out of my way to learn how to tend to wounds myself if I could."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star noticed the brow raise, then looked away. Did she say something weird? Truly, she was too innocent in the matters of the heart to know what she invited. Among more flirtatious company, she was utterly out of her depth and bullied to an inch of her face's ability to hold a blush. Moving on from that, she nodded to the mostly expected answers. "I noticed the medical training. I learned much of that myself from a few different mentors over the years; healing has always been a calling for me, though there's only so much I can rely on my magic for that. And I wouldn't use my sympathetic healing on just anyone unless it was critical." Something said casually, perhaps without thinking about how it drew the natural parallel to how eager she was to use it on Ellesandra. She kept going without notice of this however. "I commend you for your iron stomach. I would sooner live off the land than even think about some of the culinary masterpieces you must have experienced in your time in service.."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The sympathetic healing comment got her to look over at Star again curiously, eyebrows raised. She didn't call Star on it, on how much Star had wanted to use it to heal Ellesandra. It could just be that Ellesandra couldn't be healed easily with normal magic, so it was the main option for her. It could also be the supposed resonance between them, but she suspected it was something different. She pursed her lips for a moment, then turned to look out over the quiet night of the town again. "I would prefer to live off the land too, but when you're travelling in large groups that's not as much of an option. Additionally, just typical rations you can buy from the store would be too expensive for a large group over month's of travel, so you take what ingredients you do have and make it stretch as far as it can go. I understand why the food was like that, even if I didn't particularly enjoy it." She began rubbing at her shins beneath her breaches, happy it was a warm night because she would have been getting cold by now otherwise.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  If the two hadn't committed to two days of rest, Star might have been more eager to get back to bed to ensure she caught up on some lost sleep from recent days. But for all she cared she could sleep until four in the afternoon the next day if it meant she could stay up and have a moment that meant something with Ellesandra. Assuming the knight was true to their word and didn't feel the whole thing to be in jest, the two were to be together for at least a whole year. Not that Star gave a damn about the formality of 'hiring' Ellesandra, which was just a front to try and give them some money. Not that she'd admit as much freely. The knight was free to go any time as far as she was concerned but...She did want them to stay. She did notice the rubbing though. "You're not cold, are you?" she asked with idle concern. "We don't have to stay up here. Though I...Need to thank you for taking me up here. I feel better than I did...I hope you are having a good time here with me, too."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She shook her head. "Oh no, I was just thinking it is nice that it is a warm night. Otherwise I might have been getting cold." She did look sideways at Star curiously though. 'a good time here with me, too.' Was Star flirting with HER? She eyed Star curiously for a moment, then shook her head and turned back out to watch the sea in the distance. "Well, I think I've done what I set out to do here. You wanted to know some more about me, I think that's three different stories of my past I've shared?" Oh, none of them even came close to touching the mountain that Star was actually curious about, but the empath would just have to take what she could get. This was more than Ellesandra had shared with someone for a long time, since the incident actually. "Glad it helped you feel better."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a smile at those words, nodding and glad to hear the knight wasn't cold or uncomfortable. "I like knowing more about you. Even the small things," she said, then giggled. "Hey, what's your favourite colour?" A silly question on the surface, but...Ellesandra had certainly seen how much importance colour had to Star and her powers. The swath of colours that surrounded her when she meditated demonstrated as much. "Mine is blue. Azure, actually. Like the sky."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Favorite color? She hadn't considered a favorite color in years. She was thoughtful for a moment, looking up at the dark, starry sky as if she could see the blue azure in it that Star had mentioned. Closing her eyes, she knew the answer she would have said just three years ago. It was no longer the same answer, though. The brief pang of loss only happened for a moment before she was considering a new answer to the question. Eventually, she reached up and ran a finger across the center of her own chest, where her armor would have been if she'd been wearing it. "Silver. I consider the sight of silver hopeful. Seeing armor and swords around me, the dull greys and the brighter, polished silvers all blending together. Torm's gauntlet on his symbol, I'm sure a lot of people might look at something like that and have fear if they've been on the receiving end of people who use weapons and armor to oppress or hurt. But I like the glossyness of it. The sun reflecting off of a breastplate, and.." She paused, reaching up and running a hand through her hair. Unnaturally silver, for someone so young. She'd had it ever since she could remember. "I've grown to enjoy my hair color. Makes me stand out, which is unfortunate, but also something I wouldn't give up."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled at the response. She was obviously happy with it. It meant more to Ellesandra than just 'I like it', namely. There was depth to the emotion. And Star was all about depth to emotion. It was strangely uplifting, enough to brighten her smile significantly. Though it might not be clear to Ellesandra, it was, to Star, an insight into the core of the woman. The place she cared most about. Indeed, it wasn't the actual answer that mattered, but more how much thought and meaning was behind the answer that had Star looking genuinely brightened. "You do have a nice hair colour. It's...Hm." She looked at Ellesandra's hair for a time, deciding how best to describe it. "...Well. I don't think you'd agree with what I think about it. But it's nice. It suits you. Brings out eyes quite well and compliments your complexion, and looks dashing in the ponytail you wear. Though, as close as it is, I prefer it when you have it down." There she went, light-heartedly going on about Ellesandra's beauty without a single moment of inhibition.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't sure why her answer had made Star so happy. She narrowed her eyes in confusion at the woman beside her, tilting her head to the side. Why did that matter so? Did her own aura have a lot of silver in it or something, that would explain the color choice? The curiosity to see her own aura rose, but she pushed it down. She knew she'd see something there that she did not want to see, and as much as she might pretend it wasn't there, she knew in the back of her mind it was. The weird comment about her hair made her tilt her head to the side and pull it over her shoulder, looking down at it. Was there something wrong with it? Then the casual comment on how dashing she looked made her snort. Star was so innocent and naïve she didn't even realize what she was saying could be interpreted as flirting. Another reason that Ellesandra shouldn't try anything with her; Star had indicated previously that she'd never been intimate with someone, after all. Ellesandra wasn't about to take advantage of that. "Well, even if I don't agree what you think about it, I'd love to hear it. Other than your flattering me there, which I don't think you meant as part of that statement since I've done nothing to imply I think I look less than dashing." Ellesandra knew she would be considered beautiful to some. She was fit, athletic, and had one of those rounder faces that many considered adorable. She hated her face shape a lot of the time, but it had it's benefits.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star giggled. "I'm not afraid of flattering you. There's plenty to flatter. But if you want to know what I truly think of it? When I think of seeing your hair blowing gently in the breeze while standing with the sun rising behind you, the only thing that comes to my mind to describe it is...Heroic." She redoubled her smile at that. Even if Ellesandra disagreed, it was how she felt. "Glad we can at least agree on how dashing you are, if nothing else, ehe.~"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra paused, turning to stare at Star and her giggling - flirting. Well, it might not actually be flirting, but Ellesandra wasn't sure. Confusion clouded her as she watched the mage next to her, eyes squinted and trying to determine her game. Was it just naivety and she was saying things she thought were true, but not with a goal behind it? That was most likely, but Ellesandra was doubting how true it was. After a moment, she decided to go with that anyways. Even if Star was actually flirting with Ellesandra, it was a bad idea to pursue anything there. Best to assume platonic and keep acting that way. Turning, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Heroic." She muttered, considering Star's image of her like that. "You're wrong." She reached up, rubbing at the base of her neck and staring into the night sky. She used to think she'd be heroic, some strong lady knight who would save the world. That was what she daydreamed about as a kid, even as a young teenager. She had no such fantasies any more. This was a job, the only thing she knew how to do and was good at. It was no longer a life long dream, but simply a way to survive. Taking a deep breath, she slapped her hands onto her thighs and then moved to stand, planning to effectively end their night out on the roof. "Well, I think I'm going to head in to bed. I'd feel more comfortable if you did as well, not just staying out on this roof where some shadow or pirate could assassinate you. Are you ready?" It was an obvious brush off from the topic of heroicism, and a potentially forced end to what Star might be considering a pleasant evening, but Ellesandra simply didn't have it in her to talk about herself any more. She was already stretched more than she had in a long time, telling the stories she had.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wore a smile even in the face of Ellesandra telling her she was wrong. "I did tell you that you wouldn't agree with me," she said, not fazed by the brick walls Ellesandra was busy laying mortar to build around herself again. She could see the complicated emotions that surrounded the notion swirling around on Ellesandra's aura. A hint of hopefulness at the word smothered by crushing waves of the usual other emotions. It wasn't difficult to understand; Ellesandra had shared at least the surface of what she assumed was the primary source of her pain. The life of growing up an orphan had given her a new nuanced understanding after this night. The envy. Seeing how much her own mother loved her had inspired it in Ellesandra enough to paint the picture that perhaps Sia wasn't the only one who was hard on the woman. It certainly explained why Ellesandra was so rigid. As if a whip would crack if she stepped even an inch out of line. And that, too, could very much be true. The mention of whips offhand had evoked a jolt from the knight's heart. What Star saw briefly...She might be brought to anger, if not for wanting to maintain a smile for Ellesandra. Her anger for the knight's past was there, no mistaking it. But it had its time. It had its place. This wasn't either. It was left to sit and bide its time, ready to one day showcase the rare side of Star. The angry one. The one that was capable of breaching her goals of pacifism to unleash her torrent of anger in admonishment of those who had wronged Ellesandra in her eyes. Perhaps an anger that would never have its outlet. Yet it remained true that she would not allow these wrongs to go without a proper verbal lashing given the opportunity. All of this was sequestered away, out of sight, out of her heart. It had no business souring this evening. "And while I don't expect if I elected to stay that I'd catch an arrow for my troubles, it's a good time to retire to bed all the same I think." One more smile before taking her empty mug again to be returned at some point. Then, she joined the knight back to their room so they could get a good night's rest.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star had, of course, been right. Ellesandra found that she usually was when it came to emotions, even if she didn't want to admit it. Glad that Star agreed to head inside as well, Ellesandra would take the mugs down to the innkeep to be washed with a polite thanks for allowing them up on the roof, then headed back up to their bedroom to go about getting ready for bed. She was already out of her armor, but her rapier was removed from her waist and laid against the wall right next to her bed. She didn't say much to Star, but instead slid under the covers and then turned her back to the other's bed. She hoped she wouldn't have one of the dreams which made her make noise in her sleep; usually when she did she woke up due to sleeping lightly, but even still. With most clients, they would listen when she shrugged it off and said she had a bad dream. She was pretty certain that Star would be able to see through it, see it as the ptsd flashbacks they were and push on that. And so, it was with this thought in her mind to push those previous dreams back that she let herself drift off to sleep.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star fell asleep facing Ellesandra, rather than with her back turned to them. She always did, when Ellesandra was near. Perhaps something to do with being able to see the other, reassure herself if needed with what she saw. An answer that could not be known without asking directly. But it all aside, Ellesandra was pulled into slumber deeper than their usual degree. A pull that was familiar by this point, one that forcibly dragged Ellesandra into those meetings with the shadow, where the waking world was lost to them. Except this time, Ellesandra found themselves standing on an immaterial black void. Lucidity possessed them. Aware of their dreaming state, able to think and act as they would in the waking world. They were clad in the same clothing they wore while sleeping. And within this void, there were three simple choices laid out before them. Two doors, and the boundary of the dark void. One door was black, with shadowy essence seeping through the gaps between the door and its frame. The other door was white with a golden handle with soft light shimmering from behind the door. The shadow, or the white ghost. A choice. And if neither was desired, Ellesandra could feel the soft embrace of surrendering their lucidity was just beyond the border of the dark void. A short walk, ignoring the doors, and regular dreams, perhaps infused with the flashbacks that plagued Ellesandra, were waiting if they were so chosen.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hated the feel of that pull. When she came to in this strange void like area, eyes darting around and taking in the two doors, and the temptation of regular dreams down the side path she cursed. "For fucks sake!" She spun, taking in all options around her and what it was like. Part of her wanted to just sit and waste the time of whatever was behind each door. What if she did that? That is, in fact, what she did. Instead of moving off to where she could feel the soft embrace of normal dreams, she moved to where she was just in front of the two doors, standing about as close to inbetween or in the middle of them as she could, and just plopping down on the ground, criss cross apple sauce. She leaned back, palms behind her on whatever served as 'ground' here, and stared at the doors. "If you want to come and fuck around with my consciousness and decisions, the least you can do is both come out of the damn holes you're in and have a group chat here. Maybe I can watch you kill one another, that'd be a fun dream. " Ellesandra was irritated at the constant invasion into her conscious. Star did it, though in her defense it wasn't intentional, but it was still an invasion to Ellesandra. And now she had two different beings doing it, not just the shadow? She didn't care if this white and gold, supposedly 'positive' and 'heroic' vibe was actually good or not. Even if they opposed this shadow, they were still trying to use Ellesandra like some pawn in their games, and she didn't appreciate that.
</p>

  Perhaps to Ellesandra's surprise, the doors each opened at the same time, slowly, at their words. Through the black door stepped the shadow. Through the white door, the white figure, though the white figure lacked the shimmering blue spot that it had the last time it had been seen. The black and white apparitions stared one another down for a moment, though how Ellesandra knew that when the apparitions did not have eyes was a curious notion. "As you wish," said the ever-enigmatic shadow. "Though I'm afraid you won't get the deathmatch you wish for."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh shit, Ellesandra had NOT expected them to take her up on her challenge. She stood up quickly, ankles rolling smoothly to stand up in one smooth motion and taking a few steps back to ensure there was enough distance neither being could lash out at her without her having an opportunity to defend herself. Yeah sure, Ellesandra probably had no chance going up against either of them, especially without her armor or weapon, but that didn't mean she was going to be reckless in her positioning. Her arms crossed and after the moment of surprise in which her eyes had widened, she looked between the two with a frown. "That's lovely. Deathmatch would be preferred, but instead why don't you two introduce yourselves? Or shall I call you shadow bastard and light bitch? Or maybe it's shadow bitch and light bastard? Whichever you all prefer." It had been a long time since Ellesandra had actually let her ire get this evident and been petty with names - probably since she was a teen. Yet she couldn't help herself; she held her irritation with Star's invasion of her emotional boundaries back due to recognizing it not being her fault, but these beings were fully in control of whether or not they stepped in on Ellesandra's consciousness like this. And Ellesandra was not a fan of powerful beings, deities or not, playing around with her or anyone else. After what happened to Aeras and how she had been told Torm had intended that for him, else would have protected him, she had said fuck you to all beings of power like such.

  "Until such time that your decision is cemented with action, there's no purpose in revealing ourselves," said the shadow. The white apparition paused a moment, then spoke in a refreshingly feminine voice, not veiled like the shadow. "Sapphire Trisfina," said the white being. "My name is Sapphire. I know you are wary of us. Both of us. I do not blame nor begrudge you for this. But I felt it only appropriate that if...They..." she said, gesturing softly towards the shadow. "Are going to address you in your dreams, and speak of my deeds, it only is fair that I stand to represent myself. But it is my belief that our influence ought not be forced upon you. So at any time, you may walk away, beyond the boundry, to find sleep again. I have asked...them...To only ever offer you passage to speak to them, but I cannot stop them from forcibly pulling you into a shared meeting if they will it." At least this time, it seemed the shadow was playing by the rules. If there was any reaction to Sapphire introducing themselves, the shadow didn't show it. Not that it had a 'face' to speak of to examine. Just a blank slate of shadow on its head.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra rolled her eyes at the shadow, but then turned to look at Sapphire as she introduced herself. An eyebrow raised at the mention of the shadow being they, and the rules she had set upon them. Looking back to the shadow, she glanced past it to the doors, then back to the two beings in front of her. "Sapphire, huh? So are you one of their little gem creations, emerald and ruby and all, that just decided to work against them or something? Or is that name just entirely coincidental?" The doubt dripped from her voice. She was now even more convinced that the shadow was just creating this fake 'light' force to manipulate Ellesandra with. Her lips pressed together in distaste at the idea, or at the idea of falling for it anyways.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "While I can't speak for them...I'd wager it was me that inspired them, not the other way around. I assure you, I am no creation. Born human, same as you, before eventually becoming what I am today," said Sapphire. The shadow responded: "The names of my thralls are from the gems seated inside them. And if Sapphire has introduced herself, then...Call me...Black Diamond."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Black diamond? Ellesandra raised her eyebrows at them, a little amused by that, but not commenting further on it. She could just spend this whole 'dream' poking fun at both of them and annoying them, or trying to, for invading her dreams but that wouldn't be very productive. If she wanted them to leave her alone, best to let them say what they wanted to say then tell them to shove off and deny participating in their little game. So instead, she nodded. "Okay, Black Diamond and Sapphire. Sapphire has the prettier name, sorry Blackey. No, Di - yeah, Die is the right nickname for you. Sapphy? no, Sapphic. So Die and Sapphic, what I get is that Die here wants me to leave Star alone so she doesn't continue her mission or gives up, whereas Sapphic here wants me to stay with Star and protect her during her mission. Not sure if your goal is to actually ensure she dies in it by keeping her on it, or protect her to help her complete it. What's the real reason you give a damn about this though?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There would be no reactions from either as the nickname convention rolled into town. They each acknowledged, somehow, the names they had been given. "It is my desire to see Star safe, healthy, happy, and reunited with Aurora. It was a tragedy that they were ever separated," said Sapphire. "Whether you stay to protect her or not, it remains my goal. If not you, then perhaps another," she continued, earning a response from Black Diamond: "And on and on and on in a relentless and futile pursuit. Sapphire could not stop Star's last guardian from perishing. So too will be your fate, Ellesandra." Sapphire did not respond to that, instead focusing on the question once more. "I need no reason to want to see someone happy and reunited with those that love them. But if that is not enough, it is true that the Lumina family holds a gift of great import. Their auramancy can only pass through the bonds of love; all those in the Lumina family have been paragons for peace. Aurora herself can, and indeed has, stand before an army and through words alone achieve a lowering of arms, a peaceful end to conflicts that never were given a chance to begin. Star is destined to achieve the same greatness in her years to come. Thousands upon thousands of lives may yet be saved by her, so it is worth a great deal to shield her. Can you not see it, too, Ellesandra? Do you not see the purity, the kindness of which I speak? The strength that exists within her to stop bloodshed between the most bitter of enemies before it could ever manifest, and to strike down evils of this and all worlds she travels," said Sapphire, her voice filled with hope and belief in Star. "All in service of continued, perpetual suffering," responded the shadow. "A slave. A puppet for the gods to do with as they please. Protected only for their usefulness. Speaking of defending life in one paragraph, only to justify murder the next. Nothing but pandering to soft hearts for their own ends. Arbitrary lines drawn to determine when they can send Sapphire to guard someone and when it is but the will of fate, or some other absurdity they get away with only because none challenge them." The shadow didn't really have emotion in their voice, and yet...It somehow still conveyed a sense of annoyance as it responded in kind to Sapphire.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She looked between the two, listening to Sapphic's comments about Star and Aurora. That was additional proof that Aurora was alive; Star would be interested in hearing that. And apparently Sapphic was some sort of guard for the gods, to protect someone for them? Die was apparently going that route, trying to lean on Ellesandra's hatred of how deities used people to further their own ends, but she shook her head at them, anger rising as they tried to take a moral highground to the deities. "While I agree with you the gods deserve to be challenged and put in their place, Die, you've lost any respect for morality when your own creation and protected puppet had his pirates capture Lissana. They were going to rape her, maybe they even did before we got there, I didn't want to press on that question. And then likely kill her, not to mention what I overheard them talking about when they found Star that first time. Your mission might be good, but your means aren't, and for that alone you can shove off. I may not follow Torm anymore, but I still believe in honor and integrity in one's mission. So take your door away from these dreams and don't approach me again." Her attention turned towards Sapphire, then. "Whether I tell them to shove off while protecting Star though, is not your decision. I've agreed to guard her for one year, that is the deal we have currently. I maintain full autonomy to tell her to shove off as well at the end of that year and abandon her wherever she is in her search at that time, if she has not completed it by then. I won't be your god's puppet, either."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Bold that you think you have any bargaining chips in this matter," responded Black Diamond. "You're still neutral to me in this. But rest assured, if you act in defiance of my warnings, it won't be you I kill." That ominous threat had somewhat obvious target behind it, though it remained spoken with cold neutrality. Sapphire spoke next: "Never was it that I or anyone else made you a puppet, Ellesandra. Black Diamond would have you believe I manipulated you, pulled the strings of everything behind the scenes to manufacture events. It is not so. That I had a hand in matters is true, yes. I had known of Black Diamond's presence in Cloverport, and I had known what information might lead Star and, at the time, Nina there. Nina was unfortunately assailed. But I knew Star would press given the chance. So it was. I ensured that Morrun was given a second wind of energy on the fateful night he observed those from Myst, where he might have otherwise returned to sleep. Thus, he had energy to continue what he wished to do. It led to his observation. Then, his excited words reached the mutual contact which had sent Star to meet him. I had hoped he would have chosen to meet at the grove, as it was safer, but such was not to be. Star then went to Cloverport. And when Black Diamond saw this, they saw fit to pull the strings more directly with the intent of scaring Star away. Then you showed up. Black Diamond would have you believe I aim to intervene in everything...But truly, I want nothing more than for each to live their own lives, happily, and in peace. It is they who pull strings directly and speaks in half-truths to sway others." Words from Sapphire which could not go without answer from Black Diamond, of course: "Decrying me a purveyor of half-truths while speaking a half-truth themselves; they have known of your resonance with Star from the moment you were both born and has been plotting you both meet from that very moment. She will not admit an iota of this truth, how if you were not born with such resonance surely she would have intervened and saved Marigold to spare you the suffering you now bear. She will insist it is a matter of non-interference, but could you truly believe someone who stood by and watched Marigold sacrifice herself for you, and stood idle? Just like all the other gods and goddesses of the multiverse. Action only when it suits them. You say my methods and means have become devoid of morality, yet opposing me are those who enforce their own selective morality and wield all the power necessary to enforce it only to dismiss any attempt to judge them or demand better of by hiding behind their age and power as reason to submit and be subservient. Such is my path; words have failed. Peace...Has failed. So it is war, for if none of them will listen to understand how much this and all worlds bleed, how much they all SUFFER...Then the only option left is to show them how much the world can suffer. Let them see it with their own eyes and hearts until they decide it is time to rise off their laurels and act against the evil of the world. Because it is entirely apparent that the current degree of evil, of suffering, is acceptable. So it falls to me to become the paragon of suffering, of sorrows, to force their hand to try and stop me. And if they will not stop me, I will slay all of them. I will become the god-killer and end their reign. And you are but a wandering knight who has stumbled into this war; I will not be told otherwise that my intervention to advise you to leave is a mercy. For if you stand against me, you invite the same suffering unto yourself that will make what you now feel be, when juxtaposed, utter paradise made manifest."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She had rolled her eyes at Die's attempt to threaten her, or Star, simply looking over to Sapphic as she spoke instead. That was when Die responded, and threw Marigold into the mix. Ellesandra's mood shifted immediately. Even without Star's power, the change was noticeable. Previously she'd been annoyed, irritated and frustrated at the both of them, though her dislike of Black Diamond had obviously been more than directed at Sapphire. After commenting about how Sapphire had simply stood by while Marigold died for Ellesandra so that she would eventually be able to meet Star and protect her? It took every ounce of rational thought she had left not to swing on Black Diamond. She rarely took to violence out of anger, usually just using the anger to simmer and fuel her in training or something like that. She had never started a drunken fight, though she'd definitely finished them before. The only time her anger had completely overwhelmed her to where she physically lashed out at someone was after Marigold's death, and her body took on the scars from that encounter. No, it was with the training Sia had given her to control herself and not attack someone rashly that she held back, but her demeanor went from annoyed and trying to annoy both of these beings back for being a pain in her ass, to outright fury. She didn't respond at first, glaring at Black Diamond, but then turning her eyes to glare at Sapphire too. Her mouth opened, then closed. She didn't even have words to express her anger; they would simply seem like the petty response of a mortal to these two, most likely. Instead, she turned and began walking off into the void. Sapphire could go fuck herself for all Ellesandra cared, she wouldn't intentionally go out of her way to help Sapphire's goals unless they were the same goals Ellesandra had on her own. Black Diamond, though? She would go out of her way to destroy any shadow of theirs she saw in their travels; and she had no doubt that Star would be willing to go along with that, considering the things they were capable of. If the option still existed of walking out of this forced dream and into her normal dreams, she was now taking it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Silence reigned from the two figures as Ellesandra stormed off. Neither stopped her. Neither said another word. The void of regular dreams soon consumed Ellesandra's consciousness. Lucidity left them. But there would be no time to dream left. Morning was upon them both, and Ellesandra would wake to see Star kneeling beside Ellesandra's bed with her hands holding onto the edge, eyes poking out just over her knuckles. Like a cat, she was just observing Ellesandra with curiosity and, indeed, concern. She wanted to touch Ellesandra, but she knew they didn't like that. How long was she just sitting there watching?
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra woke up quickly, eyes opening up and quickly scanning the room. Her first goal had been to ensure neither Die or Sapphic were somehow in the room with them, but then she saw Star first thing, just peeking over her bed and staring at her. The fury was still there, covering the pain and guilt that she hadn't even noticed while in the dream, but had come up at the mention of Marigold sacrificing herself for Ellesandra. She wasn't quite sure what to make of Star crouching next to her bed and staring at her like this, her eyes furrowing and jaw clenching, trying to work the fury out of herself so it wouldn't be directed at Star. Sure, Star could see it, but it didn't mean she had to deal with it. Instead of asking the obvious about why Star was there, Ellesandra rolled over to the other side of the bed to sit up and throw her legs over it, her back her companion. "Not talking about it." She didn't know if she had been speaking out loud during the dream, so maybe Star had heard some of what she'd said, or if it was just Star seeing the fury that had built up and the irritation that had been there throughout the night. Was the fury strong enough that it had covered up the pain and grief? She was trying to push that down too, not sure how sensitive or focused Star's sight could be on emotions like that. Instead, she tried to focus on the day; it was another rest day, something she was reminded of due to her muscles. They were not nearly as bad as they were yesterday, or right after killing the captain, but they were still sore. "Breakfast?" A topic redirect, to try to distract Star - as useless as that would be.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I assumed as much," came Star's reply. She rose up and took a seat on the edge of Ellesandra's bed at those words though, looking over her companion with sincere and deep concern. "...Can you at least promise me that you're okay?" Obviously Star could see that Ellesandra wasn't. But Star had come to recognize that Ellesandra tended to prefer it when she acknowledged the knight's strength. Recalling when Star herself had pushed herself beyond her ability to walk and Ellesandra allowed some amount of pride in the matter from her. Some amount of her refusal so long as she was able to keep walking. Of course, she knew that giving Ellesandra an out to not talking about things was going to be taken. But more importantly, Star wanted to know if that went far enough that Ellesandra would lie to her. She would be able to see the telltale flush of emotions that preceded a lie, subtle in some, obvious in others. Or even if it was just a dismissive, angry retort. She'd see that, too. "Then breakfast, yes."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't look at Star, even as Star asked to promise about being okay. She didn't answer, back to her for a few moments before standing up and going to grab her rapier, strapping it to her waist. It looked like she might not answer, though her emotions went through all the thoughts of whether or not she would lie to Star, or brush her off, or how she was going to respond. The fury was still there, and after a few moments she motioned for Star. "We can chat over food." Well, that wasn't a brush off, but it also wasn't an answer. Ellesandra was not going to tell Star why she furious, she would not go into that, but she would explain what happened with Black Diamond and Sapphire. This involved Star, after all. They were playing with Star's life and mission, and Sapphire again confirmed that Aurora was alive, which was news that Star certainly deserved. No need to go into what Black Diamond had said to infuriate her, but explain the dream? Star deserved that much at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could accept that much. She nodded, accepting a chat over food instead of belaying their hungry bellies. It would give Ellesandra time to cool off, too. She could see the fury as it intermingled the guilt. Each tried to overpower the other, but neither could win in this war. It was just a mess. Star was certainly not going to call anyone unreasonable for what was the equivalent of 'I need a minute'. So down they went to get some food, with Star following Ellesandra's lead.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra smoothed her shirt down. Really, she wanted to take some time in the shower and take advantage of having one to cool down, but she wasn't going to hold it off that long. Plus, they both needed food. So after running her fingers through her hair to untangle knots and pull it up in a ponytail, she would lead Star downstairs for breakfast. Finding a table that was relatively secluded from the rest of everyone, to prevent as much eavesdropping as possible, Ellesandra didn't say anything at first. A waitress would come by and Ellesandra would get just water and a basic breakfast platter, since most taverns didn't exactly have a lot of options for it. It came with eggs, meats and some fruits if the tavern was lucky enough to have them. She was silent as Star would order anything, and she didn't say anything at first. Like Star had assumed, she needed a moment to process. She didn't meet Star's eyes at all while they waited, eyes out on the tavern in the guise of keeping guard and watching for anyone who might be setting up to eavesdrop. Her fury had begun to subside, though it didn't go away entirely, and she'd mostly pushed the guilt and pain back into that unmentioned mountain. Her jaw was still tensed, and she was obviously going to be in a mood for most of the day, but by the time the food came she'd mostly let herself calm down enough that she could actually talk. She'd wait until the waitress left, before speaking, looking down at her plate rather than at Star. "The shadow visited me last night, along with someone named Sapphire Trisfina. Opposite sides of wanting you to find your mother, who Sapphire confirmed is still alive."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star just ordered the same as Ellesandra. She wasn't picky despite her preference and figured it was easiest for the chef at the inn to just make something by rote. Easy and filling. They could portion out who got what once it arrived if they so wished. Star was fine to just let the silence linger for a while, but it seemed there was news. Big news. The moment Ellesandra said this Sapphire woman confirmed her mother was still alive, Star's eyes shot open wide. Tears welled in them. Her lips fell just ever so slightly apart. A dumbstruck, paralyzed look overtook her. She had no words in the immediate. Just a shocked expression as she was flooded with more emotion than she knew what to do with. Which for her, had to be a lot.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't panic or do anything to break Star out of the thought and emotion that overwhelmed her at the statement. Instead, she moved the chosen fruit entirely off her plate over onto Star's while she was dumbstruck, then sat her plate down in front of herself. A sip of water was taken, before she began eating. It might be noted that Ellesandra didn't split Star's breakfast meat or take it, but just gave her fruit. Either way Ellesandra was silent, only glancing at Star briefly, and just letting the news sink in for a few moments and for Star to wrap her head around it. Finally, she added. "This Sapphire person seems to be a servant of the gods, in some way, whereas Black Diamond - that's what the shadow calls themselves - is wanting to kill the gods. They are also the one who was behind the pirates and their power. Anyways, Sapphire wants to see you complete your mission of reconnecting with your mother, and that's apparently on behalf of the gods. So, she's alive and the gods are in your favor in regards to you two meeting up again." Slices of the information in digestible, small chunks. That was what Ellesandra was going for; letting the initial shock of her mother being alive settle before releasing the information that the gods actively wanted her to reconnect to her mother.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star seemed so wholly fixated on the reality that her mother was alive still that she didn't seem to really process the other information given to her. Gods this, war that, it didn't matter to her. "A-Alive.." she finally said. And then came the tidal wave. Relief hit her like a rock from a catapult and she lowered her face into her hands. She trembled and, quietly as she could, sobbed into her palms. The nonchalant manner in which Ellesandra carried on was not at all matched. It meant the world to her to hear this, and whether or not Ellesandra realized it was a catalyst to galvanize her. She had said previously she might not want to know, but here in the face of the information, she was certainly having a positive, if strong, reaction to knowing the truth. Still, it looked like she might need a minute herself. Or might need such a long minute that her food would grow cold before she was centered again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well if there was one way to get rid of all of Ellesandra's fury, it was to see Star break down like that. She hadn't expected that strong of a reaction. She stared at Star for a few moments, before pushing out of her seat and moving around to Star's side of the table. She was gentle, kneeling down next to Star on her side of the table, and reaching out with her left, good arm to wrap it around Star. Once again, as Star began to break down, Ellesandra turned her head and allowed Star to use her shoulder to cry on, to get that physical comfort that Ellesandra knew she needed and wanted. Once again, Ellesandra prepared for the onslaught of emotion that she knew would come through Star's connection to her. Even with her barriers up, she knew that she'd receive a large blast of emotion from the woman and she braced herself against it as soon as she had reached out to touch her. Either way, though, Ellesandra would offer that comfort, the willingness to just wrap her arms around Star and hold her while she recovered. In hindsight, doing this over breakfast, in public, wasn't as good an idea as Ellesandra thought. She'd assumed Star would respond like Ellesandra would have, and that was so, so wrong.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Truly, it had been off the mark. It was the biggest news Star had received in a long time. So when Ellesandra touched her, their two auras resonated together and the crushing waves of mixed relief and sorrow and urgency and a thousand other frantic emotions bombarded Ellesandra's heart all at once. As always, Ellesandra was not forced to feel these emotions herself, but rather the emotions were bared to them to know. The empathetic connection made it so the knight could know all of what was in Star's heart to the degree their connection permitted. Resisting it didn't stop the emotion, though it wasn't pointless either. It just wasn't enough to stop it all. Just enough to take the edge off it all and blunt the feelings a small amount. Star leaned into the knight. She took the comfort. She took all they could give her while slowly finding her way to serenity again. It would take some time, and draw some wandering eyes from the inn, but otherwise proceeded without incident until such time that Star was able to sit upright again and draw in slow, measured breaths. In, out, in out...All just to try and calm down again. She would need to be reminded that she even had food in front of her; there was no guarantee she would be able to even eat in the wake of what was truly monumental news.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was patient, doing her best not to pry in on Star's emotions. Yeah emotions were bared to her and available, but Ellesandra made a concerted effort not to focus on those. Instead, she looked away while holding Star, glaring down anyone who was looking their way for too long, and simply letting Star feel the emotion. It wasn't until Star began to pull away and sit upright again that she moved away, a silent sight of relief coming as the contact stopped and the pure overwhelming plethora of emotion was no longer bearing down upon the knight. She didn't say anything else, but instead pushed Star's plate directly in front of Star's face again to indicate she needed to eat, while moving to begin eating herself. She paid no mind to the food being cold, if it was. She also didn't say anything else, recognizing that Star had experienced much more from that news than Ellesandra had expected. She wasn't sure how long Star might need to recover from that, considering the immensity of her emotions. That was more emotion than Ellesandra ever let herself feel, but also Star was better at processing and feeling emotions than Ellesandra was, so she really had no idea what it would take to get Star back down to normal. It had been good news, right? There had definitely been sorrow there, but she wasn't sure why that would have been sad news. Maybe it was sorrow at being separated? Or the sorrow from the grief and anxiety of what might have happened? She didn't know.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The food hadn't gone cold quite yet. Lukewarm, yes. But even as it was pushed in front of Star, she just...Looked at it initially. She knew she had to eat, but how could she do anything except rise up and charge onward? Of course that was a foolish plan. She didn't even know really where to go besides this lead they were following. And what if her fervor cost her her only chance to get to Myst, then to her home? She couldn't. Even more so, now that she knew her mother lived still. She couldn't risk it. She needed to calm herself, but the knowledge came with the double-edged blade in reinforcing that she could no longer delude herself by thinking nobody was waiting for her. Her mother was waiting. And now she was pouring over every decision she'd ever made. How much time had she wasted? How much closer could she be in this moment if she just kept pushing onwards? From Ellesandra's position, she just looked like she was a million miles away. She was there, but she wasn't present.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star didn't eat, and just stared at her food, Ellesandra reached over so her hand was in front of Star's face, and snapped to get her attention. "Hey." Her voice wasn't the gentle, encouraging voice Star would probably use in this instance. Something to ease someone out of shock and into the right actions. No, Ellesandra's voice was sharp, cutting to get her attention; the command of someone who was telling someone to listen, not requesting it. "You need to eat. You are no good to your mother or anyone else if you don't take care of yourself. Which includes continuing to take today to recover from your magic expenditure; we agreed two days rest here, and today is the second day. Then we'll head off to search for these traveller's from Myst. We have a plan, even if it's not going to be fast. All we have to do is keep moving forward as planned. But to do that, you have to eat, and drink, and rest." Ellesandra didn't know what was going through Star's head, and how close she'd been to exactly those concerns. If she had, she would have phrased it differently, commanded Star not to be rash and run off. But instead, she was emphasizing that Star couldn't forget to practice self care in her attempt to find her mother; she'd get herself killed that way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  As emotional as Star was, she had proven multiple times that she was capable of being rational and thinking things through. Even when it seemed she was acting rashly, she had thought things through. That she was so highly emotional was, perhaps contrary to what most expected of her, precisely why she was able to stay calm and stay logical when she needed to. So she did snap out of it when Ellesandra spoke to her. She looked at them. She nodded gently. And with rather noticeably trembling hands did she set about eating. Slowly, but...She ate. Out of necessity, not enjoyment. Normally so thoughtful and deliberate in her actions, she had been reduced to a woman acting on little more than instinct.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
This was outside of Ellesandra's expertise. How to handle Star was something Star would have been good at, and Marigold. Ellesandra was never good in situations like this. So, she didn't say anything else, just keeping an eye on Star as she ate to make sure she was eating and not about to bite her own finger or something like that because she wasn't paying attention. Ellesandra again regretted saying this over breakfast and not in their room, but it was too late now. How was she supposed to have known it would have that level of effect? On the positive side at least, Star was entirely distracted off of Ellesandra's emotions and how she'd woken up. So, unless Star said anything, Ellesandra let the breakfast go by in silence, sipping on her water and keeping an eye out on any pirates or anyone who was looking over at them with distaste or hatred. The crying had obviously brought some attention earlier, and she wanted to ensure that it hadn't brought any negative feelings or looks from anyone. The last thing Star needed right now was someone to comment something rude to her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There hadn't been a single pirate in sight since the captain had been slain. Just regular city-goers. Some who showed concerning looks for Star, but were swiftly dissuaded as it being none of their business with one glare from Ellesandra. It wasn't long before as far as anyone else was concerned, the two weren't even there. Privacy was secured, at least. Star finished her food without a single word. She had found comfort being near Ellesandra, and that comfort was keeping her together. But this was not the same Star from the morning. Not the cute, sweet girl who could stand up even to Ellesandra in stubborn defiance. She was now a girl who was...Overwhelmed with the world and all that weighed on her shoulders. Not terribly unlike Ellesandra, the difference being that Star was allowing her feelings to flow through her instead of simply pretending she hadn't heard what Ellesandra said.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let the silence go on, and when they had finished their meals she collected their plates and stacked them so they would be easy for the waitress to get. She also placed payment on the counter, but didn't stand from the table, sitting there and watching Star. The waitress came by to check on them, and Ellesandra ordered two hot cocoa's again. This was odd, being it was the morning and those were usually a snack at night - cocoa wasn't cheap or easily accessible for a lot of people. Her having ordered a cup for them both last night was likely seen as a type of luxury for a special occasion, but doing it again this morning? Still, everyone in the inn had seen Star break down earlier, and if that helped soothe her, Ellesandra would do it. "We don't have to go up to the roof, if you don't want to. But take it back to the room and let it warm you some while you go through..." Ellesandra waved at nothing around Star. She couldn't see Star's aura, but she figured Star would know what she meant. Even if Ellesandra couldn't see and read Star's aura, she knew it was there and knew Star had a lot of emotions going through her right now. Obviously, Star would be better at processing said emotions than Ellesandra, and she just wanted to give the tools necessary to help where she could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was, perhaps frustratingly, still silent even as Ellesandra went along and tried to provide comfort in the way of hot cocoa. Star acknowledged the mug with her eyes, but it was again something that she didn't seem keen on diving into drinking. Still. It had an effect, just because it was Ellesandra being thoughtful. They were trying. Star didn't want it to seem like she was ungrateful for their efforts, of course. So she at least took the mug in her hands and slowly stood, electing to move to the room rather than the roof. She wanted to retain the memory of the rooftop as it was, not complicate it with another memory so soon that was so much sadder. So without another word from her, she moved to the room, to her bed, and just...Sat, like a statue, as she worked through whatever it was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected it to make her automatically better. Unlike Star, Ellesandra was horrible in regards to handling people with heavy emotions. She knew Star enjoyed the physical touch comfort, which had been shown previously. Beyond that, the only thing Ellesandra knew to do was something that she herself would have appreciated in that situation. Just the comfort of hot cocoa and the ability to get away from things. As Star took it and just sat in their room with it, Ellesandra began going about her day in the room. She gave Star space, not pressuring her to talk or snap out of her feelings right now. After all, this was a rest day, and if Star needed to take the day to process emotion, then who was Ellesandra to stop her? What Ellesandra did do was some small exercises, working to test her muscles again after the haste spell and push them to see how much endurance she'd gotten back from the resting. She was gentle, not going too far with anything, and if Star did pay any attention she would notice Ellesandra never put too much pressure on her right arm or shoulder, for obvious reasons. Ellesandra was comfortable letting the day pass in silence, but she did make sure to stay in the room with Star, not go out wandering or anything. Even if Star wasn't in the state she was now, Ellesandra was her guard.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star had remained silent through the day. It didn't seem to help her much. She watched Ellesandra from the sideline of her bed. She sipped tentatively at her cocoa. She got up to tend to necessities when she had to. She occasionally shifted her posture. For an hour she looked to be napping. A few attempts to meditate ultimately seemed to fail. She noticed how Ellesandra could not put weight on their arm, idly thinking about the time Ellesandra had carried her. Was that overly strenuous for them? She couldn't know without asking, though she obviously noticed the pain in the woman whenever there was pain to be seen. Thoughts that she sought answers for in her hot cocoa, only to be disappointed by the lack thereof. If Ellesandra had no intentions of breaching the silence, neither would Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Carrying Star hadn't been painful, only because the weight had been positioned onto her back and legs. If she'd had to lift Star up with her right arm, that would have been painful - and weak and shaky. Sure it had put some straight on her shoulder, but as most of the injury was in the arm itself, not at her shoulder, it had been fine. The day went by without speaking, since Star didn't say anything else. Ellesandra lay in bed after her exercise, letting her body recover, then had gotten back up to clean her rapier and do the basic maintenance tasks needed on her weapon and armor. She spent the day comfortably in the silence, only occasionally glancing back over at Star to check in and see that she was still there and not sobbing or anything like that. Occasionally, she met Star's eyes and gave her a silent nod, just to let the woman know she was still here and supported, but if nothing else, she would let Star take the first shower and then would follow suit afterwards. It wouldn't be until they were both preparing and winding down to bed, after eating food and all, that Ellesandra would speak up. "So we're going to go look for the travelers from Myst, tomorrow." A statement, and confirmation of their plan.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The plan and its confirmation was met with just a simple nod. Star had her hot cocoa still. It was long, long since empty. So it was just the mug. But she had been holding onto it through the day, not unlike she had held onto the handkerchief Ellesandra had given her. It was time for bed now, though, so she did relent and leave the mug on the table. The day's work was done, though Star had noticed Ellesandra had always been proper in returning the dishes and ensuring the staff had as easy a time as possible cleaning up. There was some amount of comfort she needed from the mug. But it seemed she had gotten what she needed. It would either stay there until morning to be carried down as the two were heading out, or though Star wouldn't stop Ellesandra if they did choose to bring the single mug back down before bed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced at the mug, but she wasn't going to take it down and bother the staff with it that evening. Plus, if Star needed it throughout the night, for whatever odd comfort it brought her, why take that away from her? No, instead Ellesandra nodded to her. "Good night, Star. Tomorrow we'll set out, if you're ready." She added that last bit as a reassurance that they didn't HAVE to set out tomorrow. If Star needed more time, she could take it - and Ellesandra would still be there with her, guarding her. She would be receptive if Star said anything, but otherwise would lay in bed, facing Star's bed, and close her eyes to drift off to sleep - hopefully without irritating or infuriating gems haunting her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"Good night, Ellesandra," she said in turn, offering a faint smile. She would be awake for a while, but sleep would eventually claim her. Ellesandra's sleep was, perhaps predictably, met with the familiar pull to lucidity. A return to the dream state of the previous night. But just like before, it was not forced upon them. Seemed that Black Diamond had taken the 'rules' set in place by Sapphire seriously. Enough that Ellesandra was given the choice once more. To go into one of the doors, to goad them both out again perhaps, waste everyone's time some more, or just walk to the void beyond and have a regular dream.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra cursed again when she felt herself pulled into the lucidity and staring at the two doors. She was about to turn away and start walking into the void, when a thought struck her. Sapphire obviously knew something about Star's mom. How much? Did she know enough Ellesandra could share with Star, make her feel better? Would sharing any information actually make her feel better? Considering she'd expected the information from last night to help and encourage her, make her excited to continue on, and instead it had made Star break down and cry, Ellesandra wasn't sure. She honestly wasn't sure why Star had responded the way she had. If Ellesandra got news that Marigold had survived - despite seeing her killed in front of her own eyes - Ellesandra wouldn't have been crying. She'd have been taking action, immediately either making plans or acting on plans to go find her, at least to apologize. She closed her eyes to that thought as the guilt and pain surged, but then turned and headed towards Sapphire's door. She opened it, and took a step through, looking around warily as she did so.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The white door opened to reveal a beautiful garden of flowers and thriving nature. A waterfall descended into a still pond in this clearing, and Sapphire stood just off to the side of the pond. Except Sapphire was not just some formless white blur now. She was...Herself. A woman about five-foot-seven with brilliant platinum hair and ocean-blue eyes. Features that closely resembled Star in colour, though that is where the similarities ended. Sapphire's features were sharper, first. Her hair also was styled into two long ponytails off either side of her head. She was clad in a spotless white silk dress. Bare feet rest easy on the soft earth below. But more than anything...Two large, brilliant white wings featured extending off her back, folded for the moment. Sapphire was an angel. "Unexpected but...Pleasantly so, to see you, Ellesandra. What can I do for you?"
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took in a moment to take in the wings and realize what Sapphire was. She really was a servant of the gods, wasn't she? Ellesandra immediately regretted her choice to come in here, but pressed her lips firmly together and crossed her arms. A brief glance was given to the rest of the area, seeing the flowers and waterfall, and thinking that Star would love to visit this place. Unfortunate that it was Ellesandra visiting, who would be too distracted with displeasure at Sapphic to actually enjoy any of this. "My what great wings you have Sapphic, all the better to fly away with?" She retorted immediately. It was childish, and Ellesandra immediately regretted it, but there was still an ounce of that fury that came back from the previous night. She shook her head, taking a deep breath, and tried again. "What can you tell me about Star's mother? Star deserves to know if she's doing well, safe and not captured or something." If she was captured and being held hostage or something, Ellesandra wasn't sure if she could share that information with Star. She should, theoretically, but Ellesandra was afraid of how Star would react in that case. But if Aurora was fine, safe, healthy and not in danger at all - would that help Star? Or would that just upset her more that Aurora hadn't come for her? She didn't know, but felt like she needed to ask at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire's brows rose in a strange look at Ellesandra's response. She'll just...Pretend she didn't hear that. When the natural questions followed, she steepled her fingers together before her and paused for a moment to answer the question with a question, much in line with what Ellesandra already thought. "What would you hope to do with that information? If Aurora is well, do you not think a woman of such deep compassion and strength would have come for Star again? It is her own daughter after all. I know that if I had become separated from my daughter, all nine layers of hell would not stand in the way of bringing me back to her." Sapphire gave a sympathetic smile. It answered the question, just not directly. It was bad news, it seemed. "Is it that you've shared the knowledge that Aurora lives with Star, and she does not know how to handle it? I want to help. But I hope you can recognize that...Some information can do more harm than good. Perhaps any further revelations can wait a week. At least long enough for you to reach Myst, if not Gurhal. But I leave it up to you. We want the same end result, I believe. Star and Aurora reunited. Both happy and healthy."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. "Just because she's well, doesn't mean she has full access to her magic. Maybe something happened to it, or is blocking her. Yes, I told Star what happened, and no she did not take it like I expected her to. But I'm also not just going to hide pertinent information. If Aurora is being held hostage by a specific group of people, it's important that I at least know that so I know who and what to look out for. If they are going to be holding Aurora active, they may be looking to capture Star the same way." She honestly didn't know if she'd tell Star, even if she thought Star would deserve to know. But, she was certain that it was better for her to know, at least. She needed to know what situation they would be walking into.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire gently nodded. "As you wish. As you suspect might have been possible, Aurora is being held captive. One of the lesser minions of Black Diamond keeps her imprisoned. You already were introduced to her greater minions, I believe you mentioned. Emerald and Ruby and Onyx. Not their real names, I'm sure you may have surmised. Neither is Black Diamond the true name of that person." Sapphire clearly knew much more about Black Diamond than she was sharing, but it was clearly purposeful. Just as this dreamland was changed to be a matter of choice, there was some sort of mutual respect given back to not reveal things about Black Diamond that they themselves did not reveal, and so did Sapphire stick to particularly neutral language on the matter. "But I digress. There are not one, but two forces who will be hostile to you should they learn of your intentions. The first is simply the Cult of the Black Diamond. Fanatics of the very same shadowy person who stands opposed to me. The others are known as the Apostles of Faust. If you embarked on this journey a few years ago, they would be neutral, perhaps. But there exists now a tenuous alliance between these two groups. I'm sure Black Diamond will send their greater thralls after you as well, though I would not expect the greater thralls to engage you in direct conflict most of the time. They act in clandestine ways more than direct confrontation. Ultimately, it is the Cult of the Black Diamond who has Aurora in captivity. Though, unfortunately the 'where' of that is beyond even me. But I'm sure you're capable of being convincing enough to figure that part out in time."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded. She was glad to have asked, at least. Knowing that there were other of Black Diamond's minions out there, and that if she sensed one again - would she sense them again? - it may be worth investigating safely to see if Star's mother was there was important. The information regarding the the Apostles of Faust, an organization she hadn't heard of before, was also useful and something to keep an eye out for. "Well, Sapphic, I appreciate the information and will keep an eye out for both groups during our travels. One more question, will these doors begin appearing every night or is this going to be a special circumstance situation?" For some reason, the idea of them appearing during special circumstances was even more annoying to her. If they were just consistently there for her to choose to go to or not, that was one thing. But if they were going to be sent as a sign that one or both of them wanted to talk to her? That would get annoying, fast.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was something about Sapphire's face that suggested she found the nickname she was given mildly amusing. A little tug of her lips each time Ellesandra said it. Otherwise her posture was neutral; a calm stance with hands folded before her, left over right, which displayed her gold wedding band and diamond engagement ring on her left hand's ring finger. She nodded to the thanks. "It's my intention to come to an agreement with Black Diamond that we both cease. When you get to Myst, it will, for reasons that involve high level arcana that I would not wish to bore you with, be impossible for either of us to present ourselves in your dreams. And when you get to Gurhal, it will become possible again, but...At that point, Black Diamond has stated that is where they will consider you their enemy. So I can see the only purpose to continue to appear to you would be to torment you. It's my intent to prevent that. But rather than decide what is best for you, I'd rather you tell me. Do you want to maintain a line of contact to one or both of us? Would you prefer to be left alone entirely? I can make no promises to the conduct of Black Diamond, as they have a proclivity to be...Clandestine and insidious. I can only promise to do all I can to keep them away from you, if such is your desire. I don't promise perfection but...Most nights, at least, should be free of influence." A few subtle implications came with the explanation, perhaps most notably being that this powerful angel was either equally matched, or perhaps at a disadvantage in power against Black Diamond. Clear enemies, and yet neither seemed capable of defeating or fully controlling the other. And somehow, Star and Aurora, and now Ellesandra, were caught between them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra ignored the obvious amusement from Sapphire at the nickname. The fact she was amused might imply she was actually sapphic, which was neat. It was also just amusing, overall. "An agreement with that being? Count me out of it. The only agreement I'd get in with them is my rapier through whatever counts as a throat for them." They were sure they hadn't seen Black Diamond's true form at all, so it was just going to be a matter of finding them eventually. Hearing that they would both be leaving her alone while in Myst was reassuring; perhaps their time in Myst itself would be relatively safe, if Black Diamond couldn't have much hold or sway there. Oh, that didn't mean they wouldn't encounter other dangers natural to Myst, but at least they wouldn't have to worry about these two beings fucking with them at all. At the idea of them being considered an official enemy of Black Diamond, she shook her head. She should already be considered that, but she wasn't going to say that and encourage them to attack before they got to Myst. "Perhaps you continue giving the choice each night. If you do that, it might encourage them to not just step into my dreams forcefully like they have in the past." She wasn't sure, but she was willing to bet if she refused to have that choice and just always go to normal dreams for the rest of time, eventually Black Diamond would invade them. But if she left that choice open, she was forcing Sapphic to also be present potentially, and which might dissuade them from doing anything shady. or maybe not, Ellesandra really didn't know.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sapphire gave a difficult expression at the mention of Ellesandra putting their rapier through the throat of Black Diamond. "Were that all it would take," was all she had to say in response to that. Quiet, and somber. Not very fitting for the bright angel standing before Ellesandra indeed. "If you wish to retain the choice, then it shall be so. Keeping it that way is likely to keep Black Diamond more passive, and should they decide to be waiting in front of their door, I can be there as well to keep them in check." Just as Ellesandra had surmised, keeping Sapphire close would have its benefit at least insofar as countering the shadowy counterpart. "And of course, I can remain available to you, should you need or wish to speak on any matters. I know that Black Diamond has already tried to turn you against me, and will continue to do so. I can't ask you to trust me, but I hope to earn that in time all the same."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
"That would work perfectly then." Her plan of using the apparent rival between these two to get some semblance of privacy and peace for herself was apparently a good one. She nodded to herself, considering it, and wondering if she could just chill in the 'waiting room' of whatever dream this was rather than going into her normal dreams, too. Would that be a way to avoid the nightmares she had? It might be worth testing, but she didn't want to ask that. It would be too vulnerable, with some angel she didn't trust. "Sapphic, all offense intended, I won't be a servant of the gods like you, and won't trust you fully because you are. Our goals happen to align right now, so I'm comfortable working together. But I won't trust you are making suggestions or acting of your own will. Black Diamond is an ass who needs to be stopped, but they aren't wrong. Gods can roll over and die for all I care." There was a small semblance of pain in the statement, but it was mostly repressed anger. Anger that she'd not let herself show when it happened because she'd been surrounded by people who followed Torm and were happy to continue to serve him, but how her faith in him - and thus, other deities - had been utterly crushed. This had only been reinforced with what happened with Marigold, and what happened after. Her eyes flashed at the idea of being used by the gods, but the only thing she could do was do what she thought and felt was right in the moment. If it happened to align with what the gods wanted, that was unfortunate but whatever. But she would not be brought out of her normal acting for them, not again. "Is there anything else, or am I free to go back to normal dreams now?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "That remains yours to decide," responded Sapphire, showing a sympathetic expression as Ellesandra declared there could not be trust between them because of her service to the gods. "I am here to answer your questions and offer guidance only if you ask for it. I know how hollow it will sound to you, but I do genuinely want you to walk your own path and support you in that. But that aside, if you have any other questions, ask them. Else...I won't hold you from your slumber."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waved her hand. "No other questions. Have a good...whatever for you." She was going to say have a good night, but did Sapphire sleep? If she was always here while Ellesandra was sleeping, was that because she didn't need to sleep? Or was she just awake at the times Ellesandra slept? Questions she didn't really care to have an answer for. Turning, she would move back through the door, and if needed, walk off into the void, hoping that her nightmares would not come afterwards, and that the brief spike in rage wouldn't have woken Star at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Just as the nights before, there were no regular dreams on the nights the conversations transpired. Even the short conversation seemed to take Ellesandra from night to morning. Perhaps there was time between that just wasn't remembered. Either way, the morning came to find Star already up, showered, and sitting on her bed with a look of passive impatience, if the idly tapping foot was anything to go by. She looked ready to go.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra woke up, blissful in not having had nightmares, and slowly moved into a sitting position. Her eyes trailed over to Star, who was tapping her foot and looking like she had been ready to leave for the past hour. Was that because she was feeling particularly rushed, now that she knew her mother was alive? Or had Ellesandra slept in more than she'd expected to? "Mornin'." She said softly, reaching up to rub at her eyes for a moment before standing and stretching. Her muscles were still sore, but it was minimal now; the kind you got after a decent workout, and could easily be worked through. It wouldn't effect her performance at all. Another glance was given to Star already being ready. "I'll be quick." She commented, grabbing a change of clothes and stepping into the bathroom to just change into fresh clothes and do basic morning hygiene rituals. She didn't shower, as they would just be getting dirty throughout the day anyways and she'd showered last night. She stepped back out, changed and moving to put her armor and such on afterwards. "Did you sleep alright?" Trying to make casual conversation, for the pure purpose of judging how well Star was doing today compared to yesterday.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star flashed a smile at Ellesandra when they said they would be quick. Looking out the single window in the room would reveal that it was barely dawn. It was early. Earlier than either of them would normally be up. About the only way Star could hope to be up before Ellesandra. A situation that was made clearer when the knight asked if Star slept okay, earning them a small shake of her head. She said nothing further on the matter, content to just answer the question with a negative. She didn't have bags under her eyes or any visible signs of fatigue, so despite not sleeping well she was well and clearly awake at least.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The shake of her heard and lack of response concerned Ellesandra for her companion. She continued putting on her armor, but moved to stand in front of Star as she did so, buckling straps mostly by habit and memory without looking at them, and instead looking at Star directly. "Star, if there is something you need to say or talk about, do so. I'm comfortable with silence and am happy to travel in silence with you today or however long it takes you to get out of this.." She paused, waving her hand. Emotional state sounded demeaning, but she wasn't sure what else to call it. "Headspace you're in" That worked, right? "But if something is wrong or bothering you and you don't want to just be silent, then it's open." It was probably odd, Ellesandra inviting Star to share when Ellesandra herself absolutely refused to do so. There was an important note here though - she was offering this if Star was wanting to share. There was no pressure to do so if she didn't want to. Ellesandra of all people knew that sometimes it was best - or it felt best, even if it wasn't - to process silently, take some time to yourself, but that didn't seem to be how Star handled things. It hadn't been up to this point, anyways.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked up at Ellesandra from her seated posture and just...Stared at them for a moment. There was some measure of recognition for the disconnect. Sure, the offer was a passive one. But the way Star looked at the knight still suggested she found the offer a little...Unfair on some level. Not enough to say anything. Just enough to show a rare flash of upset before it melted into a sigh through her nose as eyes closed. "...I'm just coming to terms with the realities that either I wasn't important enough to come looking for, or the news that my mother is alive comes with a big caveat that something awful has happened to her. Neither of those realities is easy to bear. I just want to get on with this. I know you wouldn't have let us leave yesterday, so I'm just waiting with all the patience I can muster until we're ready to get a move on." Just as Star had said in the past, the knowledge that her mother was alive had changed things. Her expedience was multiplied tenfold. It was giving her tunnel vision. There was a good chance if they ran into another Morrun and Lissana situation where they needed help, Star might not offer it as she pursued her goal with a redoubled, galvanized fervor.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ah, decisions decisions. Should Ellesandra tell her? If Star was looking, she'd probably even see the confliction of wanting to be honest with Star, and not hide anything that didn't have to be hidden, but also concern for Star and her state of mind if she shared the news. She was silent while Star spoke, explaining her attempt at patience, and finished putting her armor on. The rapier was added, then the knife strapped into it's sheath just beneath her armored skirt. Lastly, she ensured everything was in her pack, then threw it over her good shoulder before sliding her right arm through the strap as well. When she finished, she turned to look at Star with a serious expression on her face. "Star, it's...the latter. I'm not sure how awful, if she's being treated well, but I do know that she doesn't have a choice in the matter of her coming to you." She paused, considering if she should share who had captured her, but she'd come this far, hadn't she? Might as well reveal the whole truth. "The shadow I spoke of, who apparently uses the name Black Diamond, has her hostage." The words were said softly, knowing that Star wouldn't like them. It was one of those things that, unlike Aeras, Ellesandra was not good at. Aeras could deliver devastating news like this and somehow make someone focus on the silver lining, that Aurora was still alive and could be rescued. Ellesandra didn't know how to do that, but she couldn't just keep that a secret from Star. Maybe it had been foolish to ask, thinking she might have been able to, but Ellesandra's honor wouldn't allow it. She stepped forward, offering a hand to Star in case she wanted an embrace after that news, like previously.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked at Ellesandra with an expression that slowly, bit by painful bit, broke. Tears welled in her eyes. Pain built behind her eyes. Not only was there possibly some awful torture happening to her mother, but they were in the clutches of this dark monster. It was disheartening. Dispiriting. Star's resolve was strong enough to withstand, but...The truth still shook her to her core. Enough that she didn't want to waste time dealing with her emotions. Instead she shot up to her feet and began hastily towards the door. She was choking back sobs, but if Ellesandra wasn't going to stop her, she was going to charge out and make a ruckus until she secured a coach to take her to the next step in their journey.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did stop her. The thing about Ellesandra pushing down her emotions was, well, she pushed them down. She didn't let them overwhelm her, like Star was doing now. The pure exception to that being the other night in the Elven settlement. Star wouldn't be able to hike while feeling this much, right now. So when Star tried to move towards the door, Ellesandra caught her by the arm and stopped her. She gave a gentle tug towards herself, though she wouldn't force Star into a hug or embrace if Star didn't want it. The tug was to encourage Star to move towards her rather than the door, and if she did, Ellesandra would wrap both arms around her and squeeze tighter than she had any other time doing so. If not, she just held onto Star's arm, either way saying - "Star, rushing right now isn't the right move. Take a breath, process or repress whatever works for you, but if you rush out you're just going to get yourself into danger. You HAVE to take care of yourself so you are in a good state to help your mother WHEN we find her." Ellesandra emphasized when, not if.

  There was a contest of desires the moment Ellesandra pulled Star back. One side of her demanded she push Ellesandra away and storm out. That every second mattered, now. That with this knowledge, every second wasted was possibly the second that would make them arrive a second too late. Then, the fate of her mother would truly be on her shoulders in her mind. There wasn't a way this played out where she avoided feeling soul-crushing guilt if they didn't find Aurora alive. But the other side of her? The other side of her demanded she listen to Ellesandra. Demanded she accept the hug. Accept the closeness she craved with her companion. Ultimately...Star was, at her core, a woman of heart. A woman of companionship. Solidarity. She could not reject Ellesandra. So she threw her arms around them, desperate and needy as she sobbed and shook and clung to the knight. "S-She could be suffering!" she cried. "She could be being tortured! She needs me! I need to save herrrrrr!" she continued to cry out in long, heavy sobs. A broken sort of crying that wasn't too different from the night Ellesandra ran off to cry to themselves. The cries of pain that came from a wound that cut as deeply as wounds could cut.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra slid her hand up to rest in Star's hair, pulling her to lean into Ellesandra's shoulder. She simultaneously squeezed at her back, and let her hand just casually and lightly message into Star's scalp and hair. She turned her head away from Star, but tilted it so the side of her head rested against Star's own. "I know." She whispered, knowing she would have felt the exact same way if this had been Marigold. She HAD felt that way, when it was Marigold. "But trust me, Star. Rushing won't do you, or her, any good. You'll put yourself into danger and potentially make it worse. We will find her, okay? I promise you that." There was more that Ellesandra wanted to say, but she didn't entirely believe it. And she knew Star would be able to see through that. Things like it wouldn't be Star's fault if they hurt her, because Ellesandra would be a hypocrite with that. In a very similar situation, Ellesandra took all the blame - not the ones who had captured Marigold, but herself. Granted the situation wasn't exactly the same, but it was close enough that the parallel wasn't lost on her. Wordlessly, she'd walk them both backwards to one of the beds and pulled Star down on it with her so that Star didn't have to worry about standing, worry about collapsing into Ellesandra or anything. She could just lay and let herself get entirely wrapped up by the knight, big spoon like, and cry until she got it out of her system.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was malleable to Ellesandra's will. She allowed herself to be laid and spooned. The emotions she felt were overflowing, and the barrier between her and Ellesandra was almost non-existent in the moment. Their resonant auras shattered through any resistance, opening their hearts to one another in the moment. It allowed Ellesandra to feel the depths of Star's sorrows, the guilt she felt for letting her mother send her away, for not standing beside her mother even at the cost of her own life. The guilt that compounded with the knowledge that Aurora might be suffering. The blame focused inward, feeding the growing mound of sorrow that swelled in her chest. The parallels were certainly there to be drawn. But Star dealt with this in the direct opposite way to the knight. She let it all flow through her. She let herself experience all the hurt. And the unfortunate reality was that with Ellesandra spooning her, holding her close, they too were experiencing it. Not through their own heart, but the potent sorrows that so closely mirrored the knight's own were plain for their heart to reach out and understand, perhaps even inadvertently trigger their own mirrored sorrows. Whatever the case, Star would need...A while before she was okay again. She'd been doing a lot of crying lately, and the fatigue was sure to mount for it eventually.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not expect to fully feel Star's emotions this time. Previously, she could see them, know they were there, feel that Star had them - but to actually feel them herself? It took everything in her not to just yank away from Star at that. She did twitch, the urge there, but she stopped herself from actually pulling away last second. Trepidation was there, but it was easily overpowered by the strength of Star's own emotions right now. The guilt, it was so familiar. As she felt it, it was hard to even separate it from her own guilt at how Marigold had just went and gave herself over, for Ellesandra. She let out a breath, as if punched in the gut, when those feelings began to overwhelm into her own. "Fuck." She breathed out, not even realizing it. She wanted to hold Star and help her through it, but she didn't know if she could. Star was just...FEELING all of this. And on top of that, unbeknownst to her, Star would be feeling how her own emotions were tugging at those same ones in Ellesandra. It felt like a void inside of Ellesandra, one that she avoided at all costs, was slowly leaking the pain and guilt from it. The mixture of shame in that guilt, feeling as if it had been her fault, and also that being reinforced by others in her life afterwards. The pain at losing someone Ellesandra had loved; it wasn't as overwhelming as Star's only because it was held back, repressed firmly, but the extreme feeling from Star broke into it some. Ellesandra gritted her teeth, trying to resist that urge to pull away entirely. She wasn't prepared to actually feel these emotions with Star. Her arms around her slackened a little, but she didn't pull away. Instead she took a deep breath and did everything she could to reinforce the emotional barrier between them. It was surely not even close to enough, but she attempted it. Additionally, she hardened herself to the emotions she was feeling as much as she could. If she could repress them just like she did with her own emotions, she would. It wouldn't stop her from feeling it right now, but she would push them down and instead use them to fuel an anger and hatred for Black Diamond, for doing this to Aurora and Star. Still, she felt herself curl up against Star and tears prick at her own eyes from the strength of them, teeth clenched and breathing deeply to resist pulling away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star turned in Ellesandra's hold at some point during this, pulling herself against the knight instead of being spooned by them. Their desire to hold Star was clear. As was their desire to help. Ellesandra would in turn feel the same, reciprocated. A desire to hold Ellesandra, to be close to them. A safety she felt in their arms. Happiness from their presence. Comfort. Worries that tied to thoughts of being overeager. Pleasant feelings that stemmed from their night on the rooftop. It was complicated and nuanced, crushed under the weight of wave after wave of guilt and powerful sorrows. But in the depths of all that sadness, there was that singular core of comfort. Star wanted to be near Ellesandra. It was a deep, strong need for the other woman. When Star had said they cared about Ellesandra, it was a sincere statement. The care and concern ran deep in Star. A sensation of anxiety associated with Ellesandra being away from her was closely nestled in a globe of fear that closely was bound to a sensation of loneliness. It was difficult to parse a lot of the emotion for someone like Ellesandra; the mystic connection was intuitive to some degree, but it was like learning to control a whole new appendage that was foreign and had no basis to relate to. The basics were easy enough to understand, but the more complex the emotions became, the more they began to tie in knots and become indecipherable. Her heart and Ellesandra's were open to one another; if there were any doubts Ellesandra held, conscious of unconscious, the connection rather forcibly contested them. No matter where Ellesandra might look, there were no ulterior motives to be found. The concern, the admiration, the comfort, the happiness, it was all genuine. A great desire to help Ellesandra lingered as well, but it was held back, with a bubble of frustration, under a greater notion of respect. Star's heart being bare allowed a great insight into just how pure the empath was at her core, and thusly how deep her pain ran from the belief that she had done wrong, that she had caused another harm, then amplified a thousand fold because it was her own mother. Outside of the connection, Star wailed and sobbed and shook as each pound of sorrow moved through her heart. Well and truly, ignorance had been bliss for her, and having to face the reality of what she believed was her own fault, was tearing her heart into bloody pieces of gore right before Ellesandra's eyes.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't focus on any of Star's emotions, as much as she could. She was focusing on just the feel of Star in her arms and how she felt sorry for Star. She was simultaneously sorry that she shared this information, but still affirmed in her belief it was the right thing to do in the long run. If Star found out later, and learned that Ellesandra had known the whole time but let Star 'slack off', per say, she wasn't about to deal with that level of anger from Star. She felt the obvious care, concern, admiration, but Ellesandra didn't let herself focus on it, think about it. In response to it though, Star might feel that Ellesandra felt...particularly protective of Star. A caring for her that came form a sense of similarity between Star and Marigold - though Star wouldn't necessarily know that exactly. A refusal to let the same thing happen to Star, and a firm belief that she would protect Star as best as she could. Additionally, there was attraction. Star was pretty, and Ellesandra had considered flirting with her. She would have, if Star were not a client and also someone who Ellesandra thought could handle a casual thing. This attraction wasn't nearly strong enough to overwhelm the obvious grief and guilt that was wracking Star though, and even as Star turned into her and held her in response, Ellesandra reached up to run her fingers through Star's hair and do what she could to comfort the empath. Ellesandra raised her head so that her chin was resting atop Star's and Star was pulled into her chest - as uncomfortable as that might be with her armor, it was still a closeness and something to hold onto. She'd wait out this feeling, just trying to silently be there for Star, and filter out as much of the pain she was getting from her as possible.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The honourable notion of it all resonated with Star. It was the right choice. It was better that she know. It was the immediately painful choice, but the one that resulted in the least pain overall. The honest path. It forced Star to face the things she was afraid to face. And it hurt. But it wouldn't kill her. It wouldn't beat her. Because each time there was a wave of pain, of sorrow, she gripped onto Ellesandra a little more tightly for a short while. Sure, it was just armor. But where the physical failed to convey how she needed them, their resonating auras made it clear as day. The desire to protect, and the desire to be protected, melded perfectly together in splendid harmony. Just as Ellesandra's attraction was met in turn with mutual attraction. Star had said plainly that she found Ellesandra pretty. It was more than just a passing comment of course, a hollow remark. It was genuine as could be, though there was far more to this emotion than just some surface level admiration that could not be accurately understood without dedicated focus. Nuance and subtlety permeated the emotions surrounding the more intimate parts of her heart, but it would be easy to see a pathway from the feelings of safety, security, admiration, and desire for closeness to blossom into something...More, even if it now was but a seed yet to breach its shell and sprout roots; little more than a flickering spark that needed to be fanned to ignite. Such emotion was present, though no single emotion could bear any focus for long even if Ellesandra did choose to do so. Regardless, it would be the better part of an hour before Star finally grew too tired to cry anymore, before the walls shakily began to restructure between them. Not effective walls, of course. But the minimal barrier that spoke of at least attempting to separate their hearts again. Still...Star was in no shape to face any challenges. She still needed comfort.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra didn't push Star to do anything while she recovered. Each wave was felt, and she just held Star, alternating to petting her head, rubbing at her back, squeezing at her, and just holding her lightly throughout the waves of pain and sobbing. Even as it stopped, as she began to recover from it and build barriers back up, Ellesandra held her. Just because she'd cried herself out right then didn't mean that she no longer needed that comfort - she knew that even without the emotional connection. Ellesandra had done her best not to pry into the feelings she'd felt from Star during their embrace, actively not thinking about them and focusing on other things to help keep her mind focused away from them, so all she'd really gotten was that the attraction was returned in a way that wasn't just 'oh look she's so pretty!' that some people felt. As Star did begin to calm more, the crying stopping and that wall fully built again - even if not as strong as normal - Ellesandra pulled away just enough so that she could look down into Star's face, and eyes if they were open. "How about we stay here and lay like this for a little longer, then you go shower again and see if you can restabilize yourself. I'll have breakfast out here afterwards, and then we can start on our way for the day, okay?" She paused, and then added. "Do you need to talk about anything?" Ellesandra was doing what she would need in this situation. She would need a plan. Sure, she'd just let herself feel all the pain and guilt. Now time to push it away, plan the logical path forward, and then start executing it. She didn't know if this would help Star at all, and knew Star preferred talking, which is why she added the last bit there too.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked back up at Ellesandra, wholly embraced by the comforts of their arms, gestures, and voice. She stared deeply into Ellesandra's eyes in this moment, as if seeking their soul through their gaze. A gaze that said, without saying a word, that there was...So, so much she needed to talk about. So much she needed to say to Ellesandra. But despite that, she gently shook her head. "I just need to be held by you a little longer. Just a little longer." After that time, the rest of Ellesandra's plan was free to take shape if the knight sought to take that path. It didn't really bring any comfort to Star to have such a plan of action, but the notion of moving forward towards her goal was something to focus on outside of the countless thoughts that remained unsaid.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did exactly that. The staring and soul gazing seemed...odd, and Ellesandra looked away, uncomfortable by the intensity of the stare. But she did hold Star, squeezing a little tighter and even going so far as to wrap her legs around Star's so that she could feel entirely enveloped and held, entirely protected. She'd pulled Star back into her as well, gaze moving back up to the room and silently just letting Star feel the comfort she needed. Her heart beat a little harder than it probably should be, a nervousness at this embrace since Ellesandra had not truly held someone like this in...years. She'd taken lovers, but the last time she'd held a lover like this had been Sophia, long before the incident had happened. She didn't let herself think about that often, but now she did let her mind stray, simply because it was something to focus on rather than the feel of Star in her arms.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star naturally morphed into the hold, shifting to be more flush against Ellesandra. The tangling of legs, the tenderness of the hold, the rising pulse...It certainly stirred something in Star. She was far too sad to go shifting into something amorous, but the way her sorrows opened up her vulnerability? It made it all the easier for Ellesandra's presence to affect her. She tucked her head under Ellesandra's chin where it felt natural to keep it and just basked in silent comfort. It was nice. The emotional walls steadily grew stronger, but for the time they remained broken open, Ellesandra would be able to feel the quiet harmony of their auras with one another. The feeling of this moment being...Right. Natural. For as different as the two were, there were aspects big and small where they completed each other. And in this moment, there wasn't anyone else in all the realms that could bring Star the comfort she needed in this very moment other than the woman who now held her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let Star settling into her relax her a little. Oh, she was still on guard - she didn't know if she'd ever able to let her guard down while touching Star. But still, it felt - right. A rightness she hadn't felt, ever. One of those moments where you just knew you were in the right spot, doing what you should be doing. Not necessarily that it was fated, but more than in the situation they were in, this was definitely the right thing to do. The closeness and how much she enjoyed just feeling Star against her, even if it had been from a situation in which Star had been distraught, scared Ellesandra a little. And once she realized that, there was a solid wave of guilt that slammed into her. Guilt at being able to move on, to enjoy the company of another like this in more than just a physical, pleasurable way. She'd never let herself feel a connection with someone since the incident, nothing more than a pleasurable lay that they were both okay with being just that. She almost pulled away from Star when she realized that, her body shifting as if about to, but then she remembered why Star was against her. This wasn't a post coital cuddle. This wasn't waking up in the morning after sleeping together, holding onto one another and enjoying the closeness of a partner. This was Ellesandra offering Star comfort while she ached and dealt with the guilt and sorrow of knowing her mother was alive, but being held captive by someone who obviously had no care for someone else's personal boundaries, based on what happened to Lissana. Was Star worried that the same thing might be, or have happened to her mother? She couldn't imagine that feeling. So instead of pulling away, like she instinctively wanted to do, she let her arms tighten in around Star again, adjusting her head so her chin pressed into the top of Star's own head reassuringly, and closed her eyes. She'd stay like this until Star moved away, or said something.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star couldn't know what made Ellesandra want to pull away, only that there was some apprehension. Some sort of fear. But that fear also was quashed. Choosing Star over these fears. It felt good. A calm happiness washed over her at that. It was a reassurance that she was important to Ellesandra. She didn't dig deeper than that. It was what she needed, though. As she had said to Ellesandra before, the connection between their hearts, the unwarded openness and vulnerability between them, even if it wasn't intentional, had allowed her to know deep in her heart, as surely as one can ever know something, that she mattered. That she wasn't alone. And that made this daunting task, this dangerous quest, feel more possible. It made Ellesandra's voice echo in her head. 'We will find her', it echoed. 'I promise you that'. And with that, Star drew in a deep breath, squeezed Ellesandra one more time, then leaned up and placed a soft kiss on their cheek before pulling away, rather immediately blushing for what she did...But still smiled. "...Thank you, Ellesandra. Thank you for staying with me." Did that mean in the moment? In general? Both? The sincere appreciation she wore suggested both.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star began to move, she looked down at her, only to rear her head back with wide eyes when Star kissed her cheek. There was obvious confusion in response to that action, and a nervousness that caused her stomach to churn. A few blinks were given at her, even as Star thanked her, and then her she looked at Star's burning cheeks. Okay, that was enough holding. The guilt came back again, the fear that she was letting Star in too much and being unfair to Marigold - even if Marigold was dead - hit Ellesandra even harder after the brief cheek kiss. She released Star from her embrace and rolled to the other side of the bed, moving to sit up and throw her legs over the edge of the bed, back to Star. "It was my fault you felt that way, since I shared the news with you against Sapphic's recommendation." She just couldn't have held it back - her honor wouldn't have let her, but especially not after what Star had said that morning. "Are you feeling up to moving about now?" A very obvious subject change, while Ellesandra tried to build her barriers fully back up. Damn auramancer and resonance and making her private emotions not private.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a small confusion upon seeing the guilt. Star couldn't quite pin down what the root of such an emotion would be, so she would be left just assuming she overstepped. Her own guilt rose at that, which at least gave a sobering wave to clear the blush from her cheeks. "I'm glad you did. It hurts to know but...I'm better for knowing. I can act more appropriately, instead of embracing ignorance. Instead of just relying on hope." Truly, despite the pain, the steady measure of Star's voice suggested she was in a better headspace. The red tearstains on her face and the slight hoarseness to her voice told the story of the pain necessary to reach this state, but she was better for it. "Being around you helps cement in my heart that...Even the most difficult truths need to be shared. Fear has held me back from that in the past but...No more." She gave a smile to her knightly companion. "I'm ready, now."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She was glad, really, that Star appreciated the truth. They'd get along, since Ellesandra wasn't one to hold back information she knew that was relevant just to spare Star's feelings. She did feel bad about how much pain Star was in right now, because surely even after all of that crying she still would have that sorrow and guilt. Standing after the confirmation - which was needlessly sappy, Ellesandra thought, though she was ignoring the compliment within - she moved to the door and was about to open it for them both but then stopped. She looked back at Star's face, and blinked a few times. "Oh, that's right. Did you want to freshen up while I got food for us? When travelling we'll need to use the food Lissana and Morrun gave us so it doesn't go bad right away, but while we're at the tavern might as well get our breakfast here."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile at the question and nodded. "I think I should, yes. A shower to make myself presentable and calm down sounds nice," she said, then set about moving to the shower. The trip down to place an order for breakfast would be as typical as every other time, save for one thing. There appeared to be someone watching Ellesandra. From one of the corners of the general room, one of the corners that Ellesandra and Star had seated themselves at previously to avoid wayward eyes, there was a cloaked figure whose scarlet eyes followed Ellesandra. The black cloak obscured some of their face, but there didn't appear to be any weapons brandished by the cloaked figure. Instead, there was a blank card in front of them, and they had a brush in one feminine hand, with a series of coloured inkwells off to the side. Their gaze wasn't malicious, but rather...Studious, as if committing all of Ellesandra's features to memory. To someone less paranoid, the gaze might be overlooked, but Ellesandra was almost certain to notice the fixed gaze while their typical swiveled vision scanned the room for threats. Was this figure a threat? One couldn't say either way at first glance.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded, and watched for Star to enter the bathroom before she'd turn to head downstairs. She was concerned about her companion, that was obvious, but there were also obvious reasons to be concerned. She also felt that guilt, one which was hard to acknowledge since acknowledging why she felt it acknowledged Marigold's death. She got the basic breakfast platter for them both, though also got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for Star since they figured she needed something extra this morning. And Star liked, juice, right? She didn't remember for certain, but she also thought she might have seen Star drinking some at Morrun's. Either way, just a little extra to make her feel better so she wouldn't dread the hike today. It was likely Star hadn't gotten much sleep, so Ellesandra was going to go easy on any pace and encourage Star to slow down if she tried otherwise. Her eyes did eventually turn as they were scanning the room and land on one particular cloaked figure. The scarlet eyes caught her attention, along with the black cloak. Her eyes narrowed - surely, this wasn't black diamond, no? Potentially one of his servants, perhaps? The obvious gaze at her, studious, made it so that Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable not addressing it. Best to address it without Star here, safe in their room instead. So while waiting for their breakfast, Ellesandra would walk over, stopping a respectable distance away from this cloaked figure. "Can I help you?" The question was polite, but the tone was forced - obviously assuming the worst about the person after their run ins with Black Diamond recently.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	The figure looked at Ellesandra as they approached. They slowly drew back the hood of their cloak. Two furry ears poked up from atop their head of black hair. The woman wore a neutral expression. "My apologies," she began. "I was merely using your likeness as inspiration for my art," she continued, eyes drifting down to the blank card in front of her. The card was nearly twice as long as it was wide, what one would expect of fortune telling cards. As the woman pressed her sable-haired brush down to the card, its bristles dripping with a rainbow of inks mixed upon the hairs, the inks seemed to come to life upon the blank card. Colours spread across the canvas of the card, forming depths of hue and shading. A black border outlined the card, which featured Ellesandra's likeness. The card was split down the middle by a jagged golden line, with the left half depicting half of Ellesandra broken, beaten, bloody, and defeated. The other half depicted Ellesandra proud, pristine, heroic, and triumphant standing tall with her rapier firm in hand. The broken side had Ellesandra's armor cracked and splintered. The heroic side had it pristine and polished. The background behind Ellesandra on the broken side looked to be a dungeon of some sort, with wrought iron manacles attached to chains affixed to the stone wall behind them. The triumphant side depicted a background of a beautiful, flowery meadow. Across the bottom of the card, a tan ribbon bore the name of the card. However, the name changed depending on which side Ellesandra happened to be looking at. If they looked at the broken side, the card bore the name 'Defeat', and if their eyes fixed upon the triumphant side, the name of the card shifted to say, perhaps expectedly, 'Triumph'. The artistry bore impossible detail in it, capturing Ellesandra's likeness perfectly down to the individual strands of silvery hair. All of it formed itself through this woman's curious magic touch in less than a minute, where a master artist might take months to recreate such a thing of beauty. The furry-eared woman didn't seem to find anything strange about this, of course, as she turned the card around for Ellesandra to see, if they so wished to look upon it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned at the explanation, and the sight of the furry ears. That didn't seem like something that Black Diamond would have, but maybe Ellesandra had seriously misjudged them? No, this person might still a servant of Black Diamond, but just because she was wearing a black cloak and had red eyes didn't mean anything in specific. Her eyes moved to stare at the card as it was formed however, eyes widening as the art seemed to draw itself and definitely was a likeness of her. Her mouth opened, both impressed at how well the woman had just done that - it really did look like her - and bothered by the subject of the card itself. That struck a little too close for comfort, and Ellesandra was already dealing with Star being able to see into her emotions, as well as Black Diamond and apparently Sapphire knowing her past and thoughts. It put her even more on guard as her arms crossed, frowning down at the card, then back up to the woman. "And...do you typically use people's likeness without their permission?" She could compliment the card - that's what Star probably would do. But Ellesandra was wary, cautious, and didn't like being the subject of magic without her permission. If this card in any way was magically connected to her, that would not be ideal.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "People do not tend to notice me, if I am being honest. There was no offence meant, truly. But it is only upon certain people that I feel the spark of inspiration. It was important that this card be created." The woman spoke with a tone that implied she believed her words were fact. A certain...Knowing quality to them. "My name is Freya, by the way. You are welcome to keep this card in your possession. It will allow...Introspection. But I will take no offence if you prefer not to. I mean you no harm...But I also sense the wariness in you. An understandable disposition."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
People tended not to notice someone in a black cloak with red eyes? They weren't very observant then, were they? That type of garb combination tended to draw attention, in Ellesandra's experience. Her eyes turned down to the card again, not sure that she trusted it. It was obviously made with magic, but was it safer to take it herself, or let the woman take it with her? Either way was a risk, depending on how the woman's magic worked, and Ellesandra did not know anything about it. At least, if it was targeted at Ellesandra and she took it and it was some sort of trap, she knew she was relatively resistant to magic. With that consideration making the risk of this Freya taking it higher, she did reach and tentatively picked the card up. She raised it up to eye sight, tilting it to look at it for a moment, before nodding to Freya. "I will take it then, Freya." She could ask what exactly it was about herself that inspired Freya. She could also ask if it was typical for her to offer the card to people, or what introspection meant here, or how her magic worked. Ellesandra didn't, though. Instead, she continued watching the woman with a frown, only still here because she was still waiting for their food. "I will not have to deal with this card catching fire or something of the like during my travels, will I?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Freya gave a soft smile and shook her head. "Nothing of the sort, I assure you. Simply, the golden division in the middle of the card will shift left or right, revealing more of one side or the other, in balance with your own heart. For your eyes only. To all others, it will appear only as you saw it initially, until such time passes that it firmly cements on one half or the other." And as Ellesandra picked up the card and examined it while Freya spoke, what she said became reality. The card resonated with Ellesandra's heart, shifting one way or the other, though it could not go to either side fully just yet. Instead, a half inch or so to either extreme was its ending point. But what Ellesandra saw would depend on their own heart. Did they see themselves as a failure? A success? And to what degree? Would it shift all the way? Part of the way? It was still only Ellesandra's to see. "When the time comes, and the card has swayed fully to one side or the other, it will give an equally strong, yet differing boon to you. A magical strength, to be used only once. But only once your heart has become certain on which path you will walk."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When her eyes fell upon it with that explanation, holding it, she saw the shift. What was previously just the down the center, half and half of the card, suddenly the triumph side got smaller. It wasn't entirely gone, though it had shifted to where it only took up one quarter of the card's art space rather than the full half it had previously. The sign of the dungeon, the chains, made Ellesandra clench her jaw. She didn't quite know how she felt about this, but it made her uncomfortable. In reality, it scared her. It was like she told Star the other night - she didn't think she was anywhere close to being heroic. She had too much baggage weighing her down - chaining her down. The relation in the art and how she felt was bothersome. Seriously, first Star could see her emotions and now this damn card could see into her heart? It was almost as if the world was trying to force her to confront her past, when she very much did not want to. She lowered the card, planning to put it in her pack when she went back upstairs but for now slipping it into a pocket in her leggings. "A magical boon. That you give out for free. What are you getting from this? Will you be able to spy on us with this, get some sort of magic from me? Or perhaps your magical strength is strengthened by mine through daily contact?" Yes, Ellesandra wasn't exactly trusting - and this seemed like too good of a thing to just assume it was free.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "It is my duty. Seldom do I relinquish cards to others that have magic that can be used outside of the Spire, but when the calling of the card is to remain with the bearer of its inspiration, such is the result. I gain nothing for this. I will not observe you. In fact...It is the more likely result that you never see me again, unless it so happens that the Spire wills it. I do not blame you for your suspicions, of course. Those who tread a difficult path often greet fortune assuming it holds a dagger behind its back. I can tell you that no such ulterior motives exist in this gesture, but it makes little difference to me whether or not you believe me. Only that if you do walk away feeling that fortune has smiled upon you, I will be able to wear a smile. It would be nice, if I might be honest...To be able to finally make a positive difference in the life of another. But I shan't hold up your breakfast with a sob story."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Duty. That was the word that got her attention. She looked at the woman closer - obviously not a follower of Torm or anything of the like, but duty was still something that permeated many cultures and beliefs. Of course, there were some who believed in duty but still strayed from it, but somehow the woman just claiming it was her duty eased some suspicion. Oh, not all of the suspicion, but it eased the bit about whether or not Freya was getting anything from this. Sometimes you did things for duty not because you got something in return, but because it felt good to do what you were supposed to do. Ellesandra knew this well, and it was one of the main reasons she had signed herself up to Star without payment, knowing Star couldn't truly afford it. Who was she to look a gift horse in the mouth when she'd given a very similar gift to Star just recently? She still watched the woman curiously for a moment, but as she saw the waitress coming with her's and Star's plate, she would give Freya a nod. "Then I wish you a pleasant evening and that you have a smile on your face." She didn't actually consider this a positive experience - the card was too close to her truth and it wasn't encouraging. But, there was no need for Freya to know that, right? Unless Freya was someone who could tell when she was lying as well - admittedly, Ellesandra wasn't very good at it since she did it so rarely. She took the plates and balanced the two mugs in her hands, preparing to head back up to their room if Freya didn't say anything else or stop her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Freya had no reason to stop Ellesandra, though did look genuinely happy for the fleeting moments as Ellesandra walked away. Whatever the thoughts of the curious furry-eared woman were remained hers forevermore. She pulled the hood of her cloak back up, and resumed idly looking over the others who were sitting with a look of mild disinterest. When Ellesandra came back up, Star was sitting peacefully on the bed in quiet meditation, hair still damp from her shower. Ellesandra entering did break her from her meditation, however, and she greeted them with a smile, accepting her plate and juice when offered with a bit of a sweeter-than-usual smile. Star never let a thoughtful gesture go without its due appreciation. And so the usual balance of more veggies for Star and more meat for Ellesandra followed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet as the food was divvied up, but once she was sitting on the bed with the plate of food in her lap and eating, she did take a moment to pull out the card she had been given and toss it over next to Star. "Do you sense anything bad about this? A stranger gave it to me downstairs, it's magical and will apparently give me some sort of magical boon once one side or the other fully encompasses the card." She didn't need to explain that she didn't trust that way, most likely. She was interested in how it worked, even if she was wary of it, and she trusted Star plenty enough to look at it and tell her if the card was going to kill her or something. Or maybe not kill her, but if it had any less-than-good intentions within the magic. Like always, she said this between bites, eating otherwise like a very prim and proper lady would. Even while resting the plate on her legs, she was sitting up straight out of pure habit and could have easily been mistaken as a noble knight.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked and looked at the card when it was handed to her. She set her plate aside briefly and studied it. For a moment, she closed her eyes and her aura became visible. A swath of blue surrounded her, enveloping the card as well. She remained like this for some time before snapping out of her trance-like state with a jolt. Her brows knit together, then she looked at Ellesandra with some measure of uncertainty in her face. "Nothing bad, no. Just...Powerful. Very...Powerful. Entirely something that is up to the wielder of it, but it feels as though it won't respond to me. Like it will only respond to, well...You," she said, tilting her head. "Who was this stranger you met?" she asked as she held the card back out to Ellesandra. "This card it...The power inside it is...frighteningly strong. And locked behind a magical lock so potent that my magic would be but a whittled twig scratching against a castle wall made of adamantine. Whatever this magical boon is...I can be certain only that it will be yours to control, and that whoever gave this to you wasn't just...Some stranger."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra continued eating, silently watching Star as she began to examine the card. There was a concern that it would somehow trigger something and hurt Star, so Ellesandra was mindful to keep an eye on her and the card while she was examining it. When Star began explaining how powerful it was, Ellesandra took a deep breath and shook her head. "Someone named Freya, and she mentioned something about a Spire. I've not heard of her or anything like a Spire before, but I must be honest with you Star. Between you reading my emotions, Black Diamond being an overall ass, Sapphire joining Black Diamond in invading my dreams, and now this Freya person making a card with my likeness that is..." She paused, motioning to the card as if it was explanation itself. "I'm a little tired of supposedly extremely powerful beings invading on this journey. Deities and powerful beings can go fuck right off." All they wanted to do was find Star's mother, and rescue her from Black Diamond. Why was that so complicated? She speared a piece of sausage with her fork a little harder than was really necessary, wincing at the sound it made upon hitting the plate below it. "Sorry." She added, knowing that she'd included Star into that and not wanting to make her feel bad for a gift she couldn't control.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was pensive as Ellesandra responded. She ate quietly for a few moments, considering all that had happened. The stakes really hadn't seemed to be all that high on the grand scheme before. Nobody had really cared either way what she did. And now, suddenly that it seemed a plan was coming together, a path forward was being carved, it seemed everyone had something to say about it, and had to meddle in things. The annoyance sent her way certainly had its effect. Star always wore her emotions on her sleeve, and so the notion that she contributed to Ellesandra's emotional turmoil had her expression saddening rather pointedly. The apology eased it slightly, but the guilt was still crushing on her shoulders. She didn't say anything about it, her way of hopefully communicating that she didn't blame Ellesandra for their feelings. But the shame that something she couldn't control was negatively affecting Ellesandra was clear. Enough that she didn't have a verbal response to it, and she pointedly looked at her food rather than at her companion.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt guilt at how Star just didn't respond to her. It didn't take an emotional savant like Star to realize it was because she'd, in her mini rant, had commented about how much she disliked Star's ability to just read her. It was entirely true, but Star already knew that and it wasn't something she could just turn off, so pointing it out and making passive comments like she just did wasn't beneficial. She finished her own food in silence, sipping on her water, and as she finished she collected the mugs from last night and piled them all onto her plate with the water she'd been drinking that morning. As she passed back by Star, her hand came out and lightly brushed Star's shoulder. Not enough touch to really give the emotional connection time to do anything, but enough that Star would hopefully get the message of Ellesandra being sorry for the statement. She wasn't upset at Star herself, more just her power and the situation. It hadn't been a good idea to vent to a client anyways, though. A client shouldn't ever feel as if they were a burden to Ellesandra, and she had forgotten that for a moment. She'd prep things to get ready for their travel, letting the silence continue unless Star said anything else.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's hand rose up to hold Ellesandra's when it landed on her shoulder. She held it and gently squeezed, looking up at the other woman from her seat. She donned a small smile. Not enough to say everything was sunshine and rainbows, but just enough to say that they were okay. Star wasn't in distress or hurt, so the emotional barrier was stable and kept their hearts separated. "...I can handle the truth. And I'm glad you can say it. So...Even if it isn't nice to hear, I wanna hear it." Trying to be courageous in the face of painful words, it seemed. She didn't hold Ellesandra's hand long, just enough for her to speak her mind before releasing it again. She would still feel a bit bad, but that was okay to her. It was okay to feel bad. This too would pass.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It may be okay to feel bad, but that being layered on top of what had happened that morning with news from her mother too, Ellesandra just felt bad for piling it on. It didn't matter though - either way, they were going to be heading out. She collected her bag and put it back on her back, having been moved away sometime throughout the comforting earlier. The card was placed in it, careful not to bend or fold or damage it at all - the last thing she needed to do was accidentally offend another powerful magical being. She double checked, again, that they weren't missing anything, and then after Star was finished with her food would stack all of the plates and such so that she could carry it downstairs for the staff to clean without it being potentially forgotten up here for a while. She wouldn't rush Star, but after completing what she needed to prep the room for their departure, Ellesandra waited by the door patiently. She made sure not to look in Star's direction so that Star wouldn't feel rushed if she wasn't ready, simply standing and waiting like a practiced guard would.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was as eager if not more so than Ellesandra to head out, and she had been ready for a while. She still did not have a pack. Yet still was able to produce whatever she needed at will. Something that hadn't really been explained, yet remained true. Just little flickers of magic any time she needed to stow or withdraw something from...Wherever it was stored. She joined Ellesandra with a brief smile to them. "Northeast past the elven settlement, looking for some ruins I believe. Morrun marked my map with the approximate location, and it looks to be about a day's travel if we can secure a coach. By foot, probably about two, maybe three days."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded. "Best to get a coach if we have the funds for it. Not sure if we will be able to take it with us to Myst, but I'm sure you'll be happy to shave off as much time as possible - and with you not sleeping well last night a coach would be useful to keep us moving today." She wouldn't say it, but she had concerns about Star travelling hard and pushing herself too hard, considering her sudden rush to get there. The rush was understandable, but it was important she didn't wear herself out and make herself susceptible to danger on the travel. She opened the door holding their dishes and held the door open for Star to head out, then would begin following behind with the dishes. An immediate glance was given around when she got back down to the main room, both looking to see if Freya was still there, as well as to check for any other potential threats that had come in sense.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"After the five hundred Morrun paid us, we could coach halfway across the country and have a month's room and board left over at the finest inn," said Star with a giggle. "Coaches only run one copper per mile usually. We'd be silly to let money be what limits us on this," she said as they moved downstairs. No other threats had wandered into the inn, though Freya was still in the same place she was before, still cloaked and still idly looking at others in the area with disinterest. Eyes did flick to Ellesandra and a small smile met her lips, but her eyes no longer lingered. Her business with them was done, as far as she was concerned. Star's eyes, meanwhile, did naturally draw to Freya, and her gaze lingered on them for a short while. A look of sorrow overtook Star's face while she did so...Though she wouldn't let it hold her up. If Ellesandra was moving to exit, Star was right behind them to secure a coach, though she wouldn't hurry them along if they wanted to talk to Freya again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	That was true. She hadn't travelled with a coach as a customer in...had she ever? She'd assumed it was more expensive, but usually she was hired as a guard or something, never using them herself since she was comfortable walking and had never been in a rush. Now, though, they could definitely get a coach. Ellesandra walked up to the bar to return their plates and their key and making a quick inquiry as to where they could hire a coach. Best to get the directions from someone local, rather than trying to just roam the entire city looking. With directions, she turned and would give Freya a simple nod while heading out of the inn. She didn't notice the look of sorrow from Star, not being as in tune with recognizing emotion changes and not having been paying special attention to Star, versus their surroundings. Despite the reassurance from Star that the pirates were being controlled and they weren't really seeing pirates around town right now, Ellesandra was still on guard, eyes turning this way and that as they exited the Inn, and began making their way to the coach. "A coach is especially good because you may be able to get some sleep on it, as long as you don't get motion sickness. If you think you can relax enough to do so, that is. I can help take shifts with the driver if he needs a break as well."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The nod was met with another small smile. Fate would decide if this would be the last time the two would meet, but for now they parted amicably. The innkeeper was happy to direct Ellesandra to the trade center of the city which was in the northeast section of the pier. Coaches as well as sea-based trade services were available there at a typical rate, as one might expect of a moderately sized settlement as Cloverport. Star spoke up as they began on their way: "I can imagine you feel more at home on the back of a horse than in a seat behind them, but also I think it's fine to just let the driver set the pace. The horses will need time to drink and rest all the same, so as much as I know it goes against your base instincts, maybe try and relax a little? Not that I really have much place to talk on that front, I suppose.."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded. "Yes, I'm comfortable on a horses back, but I wouldn't be riding them if controlling the coach anyways." What she WOULD be is outside of the coach to keep a better eye out. The problem with being inside of the coach was her ability to keep an eye out for danger was severely limited. Despite Star encouraging her to just take some time to try and relax, all that was going on with these gems - which she was including Sapphire as one because her damn name was a gem too - made her untrusting of being able to let her guard down. There had been a note that while in Myst, they'd be safer from the gems, but until they got to Myst? Still in danger, and Myst surely had it's own dangers in and of itself. "I'll relax some, but I may take some time to keep pace outside of the carriage to keep an eye out too." It would be good exercise, anyways. Most coaches tended to go at a fast walk pace, or slightly slower, so it would be a decent way to stretch her legs and ensure that she didn't get too stiff while sitting in the coach. Another way to stretch her still slightly sore muscles after the haste spell the other day.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star smiled. "Well, leave it to you to find any excuse to work yourself harder," she said with playful chiding in her tone. "But let it not ever be said you aren't diligent," she followed up, sincere as could be. She never needed a reason to try and uplift Ellesandra, it seemed. The trip over to secure a coach would be without incident; no pirates to be seen, people getting back to their lives, the elves having long since departed, and it was almost as if nothing had ever happened. Certainly, some things were in the works at the upper levels. Perhaps the local lord might have some reaction to the series of events, but overall, things seemed more peaceful for their intervention now. People seemed happier. Less on edge. Though nobody recognized Star or Ellesandra or their part in all of this, the effects were clear. A good deed had been done. Lives were made better. Life could go on without fear for the immediate future, and the woes became all the more mundane. The coach service had idle drivers to spare, and a standard agreement was easy to achieve. The destination on the map did confirm it would take about a day to reach the nearest point on the main road that was near the site of interest. They would arrive, all things going well, a few hours after dusk to be dropped off.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She wasn't finding an excuse to work herself harder. She was doing her job. Typical work, not working herself harder. At least, that's how she saw it. She let Star lead the discussion in getting the coach, more standing by and looking around at the area as they discussed business. It was great to see the town starting to get back onto it's feet, even if she was a little wary of everything still. It felt like the result was too good, and Ellesandra was waiting for the shoe to drop. Then again, ever since meeting Star, her life had been turned upside down so that was a reasonable expectation. Still, nothing seemed to happen. On the ride, Ellesandra alternated between walking alongside the carriage, especially at first when they were closer to town, and riding in the carriage. The ride was nice, to give herself a break, but even while riding her eyes were mostly glued to the window, using the little bit of view of the road outside she had to keep watch that way. She had been used to walking alongside one, or riding a horse alongside, the entire way, but she wanted to ensure she too was entirely up to a fight if one needed to be had. She'd mostly recovered from the haste spell, but a long day hiking on foot at a coach's pace, while possible, would strain her endurance more than it should have. A bleak reminder that she'd not kept up with the diligent training she should have, in the past few years. Still, during the travel she was mostly silent, though not against talking if Star spoke, Ellesandra didn't offer anything up herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star would make small talk along the way. Little bits, pointing out some pretty wildlife she spied, talking about how it was fortunate the storm that looked to be approaching Cloverport had diverted and missed them...Nothing of consequence, and nothing overbearing. Silence was allowed to be maintained, and Star took some time to meditate as best she could. Some bumps in the road did make it troublesome, but she did manage a little time. She also napped for about an hour and a half along the way during one of the stretches. As uneventful as trips went, truly. But there was plenty of excitement surely to come. Their destination reached, two silver parted from their inventory, and the coach was off to make some headway back to the city before making a camp for the night. Amicably parted, business concluded, the two now had to decide if they would make camp in the wild or push on through the night. The map marker showed their destination was vaguely an hour or so through some wooded areas to reach the ruins in question; there were some lightly traveled forest paths among the trees, but a paranoid adventurer may choose instead to walk paths not traveled, with some loss of time for trudging through more untamed wilderness.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Small talk was somehow worse for Ellesandra. To her, it was pointless conversation, whereas other topics with a purpose or meaning she could get behind. Still, she never shut Star down when she was talking, at the very least giving a listening ear if not being super responsive. As they made it to their destination and got off, she was thankful they'd gone for the coach. Not only did it mean it had been progress while still resting, but it also meant they got there in just one day versus if they had walked and taken multiple nights to do so. She looked around and motioned into the woods, keeping an eye out for sign of wildlife or beasts or anyone who might be nearby. "Why don't we get a bit inside, away from the road so we won't be a target, and set up camp there? Might be able to find a river or something to camp nearby with the remaining light we have now." She wouldn't recommend going to the ruins tonight, if only because the trip would be hazardous and they didn't know what to expect, but she also would follow Star's lead. It wasn't too risky, to the point that Ellesandra would stop Star, she'd just recommend otherwise.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could catch onto Ellesandra's annoyance at the small talk. It certainly diminished the amount she was going to engage in, and would affect how much she would going forward. It didn't bother her. She could adapt. When they did arrive, she deferred to Ellesandra's advisory. "Sounds like a plan to me," she said simply while doing an idle stretch, then prepared to move with Ellesandra. There wouldn't be any fresh water sources along the way unfortunately, but there were some places that served as securable places to rest with natural overhangs to huddle up against, and dry foliage to burn that wouldn't smoke for a campfire. Star would prove to have plenty of water if Ellesandra ran out, pulling it out of, once more, seemingly nowhere. That Star was an arcane adept made clear she certainly had plenty of talents Ellesandra did not yet know about, and while she wasn't out to bore Ellesandra with all of her capabilities, she also certainly would be resistant to explaining if asked.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had only consult Star's map for a moment to confirm there weren't any water sources nearby. Rather than trying to find one then, she did lead them through to find a nice, defensible and out of the way place to set up camp. Ellesandra made no complaint about doing most or all of the work to get the camp setup. She wouldn't stop Star from doing anything, but she also didn't expect it of her. She'd pull her pack off and then look over to Star, since this was the first time they'd be camping on the road together since meeting. "Do you have a tent or a bedroll in that magical bag of yours?" She'd ascertained the bag was magical, though of what means Ellesandra had no idea. Was Star simply storing a lot in a small space, or was she creating things as she pulled stuff out? Ellesandra had no idea, but she also didn't ask. There was curiosity there, but unless it was information that would be pertinent to their travels, like if Star had camping supplies, she wouldn't. It had become the norm to let her client do as they will and just support or provide as needed, even if she'd already gotten closer to Star than any client recently. "I've got a tent that would fit both of us, but I'm afraid I don't have an extra bedroll. And it may be beneficial for two tents if you have one, for your meditation."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I have my own tent and bedroll, but, erm, I don't know how to say this in a way that doesn't sound a little peculiar, but if it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to share a tent, if there's space for both of us. You see, erm...When we're in a settlement it's less a concern, which is why I hadn't really said anything, but out in the wilderness it's more pertinent." A bit of rambling, but she did seem to be circling the point, whatever it was. "I'm able to...Feel your presence in my sleep if I'm close. It helps me relax, as I'd be able to feel distress if something happened in the night. It's not the same as emotional transference that happens while I'm conscious of course, just...Think of it like an alarm, I suppose. If you find the notion uncomfortable, I won't press the matter! I just, well..." She blushed a little, here, looking away from Ellesandra as one foot bashfully twisted in place back and forth while hands folded behind her. "It would help me feel more at ease. N-No pressure, again. I promise."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra came up short at this request. She turned to look at Star, a curious and also conflicted expression on her face. On the one hand, Star was proposing it for an entirely logical reason. If Ellesandra being alerted nearby in the tent would alert Star too, that was beneficial. On the other hand, was that really so limited as to not work if they were in two different tents next to one another instead of in the same tent? Being in the same tent would run the risk of Star cuddling up close, which Ellesandra wasn't sure she was comfortable with while sleeping or not initiating it herself. It also ran the risk of Ellesandra having a nightmare, and Star being worried about her in regards to it. For something to do here and there until they got a second tent was one thing; as something to do every night on the road made Ellesandra a little concerned. "You aren't able to feel my presence if I'm keeping watch while at the fire, or in my own tent?" Was it a line of sight thing? That actually seemed like the most likely thing. "I -" There was a spike of embarrassment. A guardedness of...not wanting Star to see her when she had a nightmare. Not wanting to have to explain most of all, but also just the vulnerability of that. Still, Star wouldn't just accept a no, either. "I also have nightmares, sometimes. I'm a little afraid I might hurt you in my sleep during them. That, or ruin both of our nights of sleep with it." Neither of those comments and questions were a no, though. She was stating issues, concerns with the idea, but she hadn't refused Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "Remember the vision I showed you? The memory of my childhood? My mom was talking about my aura sense, then. That time it was to detect a most dapper and honourable squirrel of course, but...When I'm conscious, I have a passive sense for auras around me, a sense that I can amplify if I focus on it. How far I can spread that sense varies, thin objects like a tent don't affect it much, thick walls impede it a little more but...It's mostly a matter of proximity. Unless you can think of a way to mush our tents up right next to each other so there's only a few feet between us, it wouldn't really have the desired effect." The implication being that if they DID know some way to fuss that, there'd be no issue. Properly securing the pitons for the tent did usually require a bit of berth around them, however, which made such a thing difficult to imagine. She of course noticed the spike in embarrassment and guardedness, however, so she rose her hands in a defensive posture. "O-Of course, I really do mean it that there's no pressure. I...Uhm. I could also..." She paused to consider what she was about to say, then shook her head. "N-Never mind. Just. Know that if you did have a nightmare, I would wake before you started hurting me, and could wake you in turn, if that...Helps, at all." She was tip-toeing around this issue, that much was obvious. She did desire it, but she knew this was pushing Ellesandra's boundaries, and she seemed very nervous to do so.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The words 'a most dapper and honorable squirrel' caused Ellesandra's mouth to twitch a bit. She almost smiled, though held it back - even if Star could see the obvious amusement in her emotions creep up a little. There was still caution, concern about doing this, but there was also...acceptance. No, Ellesandra wasn't aware of a way they could safely mush their tents up next to eachother, and really if she thought about it, Star would probably be hearing her on the nights she had a nightmare anyways. Maybe it would be better if it was a situation where Star could wake her up before it got too deep? Especially if either of the gems decided to partake in said nightmare, not that they seemed inclined to do so right now. There were a few moments of silence where Ellesandra just watched Star, indecision on her face, but then she turned and began setting up her tent. She didn't speak until it was out of her bag, set up, and she'd thrown her own bedroll inside near the entrance to the tent. It was a two person tent, so spacious enough for them to both lay down with a little bit of wiggle room, but it certainly wasn't spacious. After throwing her bedroll in, she motioned to the tent with her head. "Go ahead and set yourself up in there." An admission, to let this happen. There was already an inkling of regret, mostly fueled by anxiety at the situation and what she might dream of. But Star had a good point, and her safety was the priority.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star saw the amusement, because of course she did. And that amusement begot some amusement in Star, evoking a little grin that silently said 'I saw that'. Amusement turned to curiosity and uncertainty as Ellesandra just...Set about setting up their tent without saying anything. Was that a good sign? A bad sign? Star almost spoke up to ask, but thought better of it, and elected to just stew in her own uncertainty and stand around uselessly for it. Setting up a tent did take a short while, so Star had plenty of time to be a bundle of anxiety until Ellesandra gave her the invitation in. She blinked. "Wh...Really?" A question and look of surprise that said she genuinely did not expect her request to be granted. With a smile and nod however, she moved over to the tent. A shimmer of white light flowed from either of her palms, forming into a vague cylinder between them. And from nothing, her bedroll came to exist. A bedroll made of sturdy material on the bottom, with plush silk inner lining on what was an enchanted outer layer of cloth to drape over herself, complete with a down pillow. Combined with the dress Star wore that never seemed to be able to stay dirty, and that Star had always carried a breezy, floral scent never once tinted with unpleasant odors, magic was the only answer to the question of how this woman maintained all of these things. Most bedrolls were obviously made for one, but this one seemed more spacious. Enough that it ensured their two bedrolls would be pressed together in the less spacious tent. Hers wasn't big enough for two people to fit with room to sprawl, but just eyeballing the size, one could see room for two if they snuggled close. Star obviously wasn't drawing attention to this fact as she laid the bedroll out, as she...Attempted to keep some distance between their two bedrolls. A little mushing of hers against the edge of the tent afforded about an inch of space between the two bedrolls, which she seemed satisfied with as she turned back to smiled at Ellesandra. A thankful smile, certainly.
</p>
 
<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had nodded at the surprise and was about to turn away, to start making the fire, when she saw the white light out of the corner of her eye. She paused, staring at the shimmer of white light between Star's palms, and then the apparent creation of a bedroll. That didn't look like it was just a magical bag; that looked like it was full on Star just magically creating a bedroll. And it looked comfortable as hell - definitely more so than the basic bedroll you can get at any general store that Ellesandra had. Her eyebrows raised as she watched Star try to fit it into the tent, and then when she pulled out to look at Ellesandra she'd see a mixture of more amusement, and curiosity. "Just so I know, in case it becomes useful in the future, did I just see you make that bedroll or is that some kind of storage spell I'm not aware of? The bedroll isn't going to be destroyed by me absorbing magic I touch if I accidentally stretch my arm out onto it or something, will it?" That would be amusing. Stretching her arm out in her sleep and draining the magic, if it tried to directly interact with Ellesandra herself that is. Then poof no bedroll for Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star tilted her head at the question, then smiled, hands folded neatly behind her back. "I can do both. That was just a simple manipulation of extradimensional space, though." Ah, yes, of course. How could Ellesandra not know? "Erm. That is. Storage. It's a common magic taught in my homeland, the ability to create a magical space that you can use to store things and retrieve at will. But that bedroll is something that was created for me by an old friend. It's weatherproof and warm. And, erm, not that I expect you to take me up on the offer, but just in case the desire ever does strike you, it can fit two." And before Ellesandra could respond to that, she went on from there: "But as for creating things, I can do that too, to some degree. Particularly with water, if you ever need some, that is easy to conjure."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
So it was storage, not creation. She nodded, one eyebrow raising up her forehead at the invitation to share the bedroll, then the quick change of topic immediately afterwards. More amusement, though also some...caution, there. Flirting with, or responding to Star flirting with her, was definitely off the table. She'd gone and learned her lesson with her last permanent charge. Getting too close to Star felt...well, Ellesandra would never admit it to herself, but it was fear. Fear that something like that would happen again - even if Star was different from Marigold in that she wasn't exactly off limits. "I don't think I'll be taking you up on that anytime soon, Miss Lumina." She smirked when she addressed star via a proper name. It was a joke, to make light of how Ellesandra was refusing to get close to her both physically and emotionally. She wasn't actually going to continue using it, and hoped that doing that would stop any potential sting her words might have if Star was secretly hoping otherwise. "And that is good to know with water. Can you make food to? We still ought to use the food Morrun and Lissana provided to us now, but if we're ever in a situation where we are running low on supplies, it will be nice to know what you can provide and what I'll need to hunt for."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took the joke as it was and offered a pout in response. She looked aside and moved one hand up, idly twirling a bit of her hair. "I'm not inviting you to SLEEP with me you know.." she said through her pouty look, using the more obvious sexual implication of 'sleep'. "I'm just saying it's comfy, and as much as you're the total opposite, I like to cuddle, even just as friends. It's comforting." She huffed through her nose, still sporting the light air about her as her hand moved back to join the other and she refocused on more practical matters. "I can create food, but it's much more taxing than just water. If I'm tapped out, I won't be able to do that at least until the next morning. But when I do do it, it at least is a good quantity. Way more than we'd need. But it perishes after a day. It's all bland, too. So as much as possible, I try to live off the land. Still. It's proven very useful when traversing barren lands."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra gave Star a serious look, waiting until after the explanation on creating food before saying "I would be more comfortable fucking you than cuddling with you, even if that would be a bad idea considering how we handle things differently." The knight wasn't joking with this, and wanted to make it clear to Star. The type of thing that they'd done that morning, with Ellesandra holding Star, was FAR out of her comfort zone - especially with the emotional connection that happened when they touched. She wasn't the type to cuddle with a friend, or even a lover, not since she'd closed herself off. It was a vulnerability and an emotional connection that Ellesandra, for the most part, no longer wanted. That being said, Star was obviously very different. She'd said she'd not been with anyone, for one. Even if Ellesandra hadn't known that, it was obvious Star cared about a connection with someone. Maybe it would be assuming and basing it off of her kindness and how much she wanted to connect with people, and also maybe Ellesandra was creating an excuse because she was afraid of having that intimacy, but still. She began pulling out the meats that had been packaged away, the things that might go bad first, and setting about putting her mess kit up over a fire. "Do you have preferences for food?" A topic change, but one that would hopefully prevent any awkwardness after her blunt statement.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	A blunt statement it certainly was. The crass words evoked a raise of Star's brows and a visible flinch. One needn't put a hand to her chest to see that her heart rate almost certainly spiked upon hearing that. She hadn't expected to evoke that kind of reaction, and much as Ellesandra tried to just shift topics, that one was going to stick with her for a while. Star wasn't the kind of person who could just push down her emotions and pretend like nothing happened. No, no. Her knightly friend was the expert on that. So it was with a lower volume and downtrodden voice that she responded. "I know you prefer meat, I prefer fruits and vegetables." That much had been obvious fairly quickly. "Whatever is going to go bad first takes priority though. I'm not picky."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She would grab one of the slabs of meat - a smaller one, and went about setting up a makeshift grill over the fire. She noticed the obvious down voice from Star, but she didn't know how to address it. It hadn't been anything wrong with Star herself preventing Ellesandra from wanting to cuddle, more just that she didn't want to overall, with anyone. Star likely knew that, but there was still a spot of guilt and...shame, for being how she was. She didn't regret saying that though; it was the truth and drawing that line was necessary if they were going to be sharing a tent. It was entirely likely that Star would feel worse if she had moved over to cuddle Ellesandra through the night only to feel how much Ellesandra didn't want that, and think it was her. Or not? Ellesandra didn't know, this was all too complicated. She told the truth, that's all that mattered right? Ellesandra ended up cooking that single slab of meat and using nuts to lightly coat it and add some texture, along with fruits. If Star didn't say anything while she cooked, the next time Ellesandra would speak or even look at her was when handing over a plate of a small portion of the meat, and most of the nuts layered atop and around the meat with the majority of the fruit on the side of it - Ellesandra obviously having taken less of it. "I will be keeping an eye out while the sun goes down, but we can hit the bedrolls whenever you want to. It might be better to start towards the ruins early, but if we go too early we might miss who we're looking for if they're sleeping in their own camp somewhere."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't have much else to say. She learned her lesson about small talk, and there was a lingering dimness to her expression in the wake of hearing the truth. She didn't seem upset by Ellesandra or the state of things. She said herself she knew they weren't going to accept. She offered anyway, because offers and openness was just who she was. But something about how it came out still seemed to sting and put a dour mood in the air. Star ate in silence, offering only a small smile in thanks when it was prepared. Naturally, she ensured the plates balanced in that Ellesandra got the lion's share of the meat since she got the rest. Once she was done, she waited for Ellesandra to finish as well while sitting nearby. Her index finger on her right hand then lit up with a soft cerulean light that exuded tiny flecks of white. She touched her finger to her plate, then Ellesandra's. A small flash of dim light shone on each plate, sending motes of white light up a few inches into the air where they then dissipated to nothing. In the wake of this tiny magic, plates and utensils were spotless. Safe to assume some similar magic was used to keep her clothes so pretty and pristine. "I'm tired, admittedly. I'll be off to bed, then." Unless Ellesandra had reason for her to stay, she did rise and move to get herself comfy in bed, ending the night with the lingering mood of not really upset, but not really happy either.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra let the silence stretch as she ate, enjoying it but also feeling bad for it. It was weird, returning to what would be considered the expected of her own preferences, but knowing that this silence was because Star's feelings were hurt made her feel bad. She hadn't meant it to hurt Star's feelings, but even someone as emotionally stunted as herself could tell that Star didn't feel great about it. Still, silence passed as they ate, and when they were done and Star used magic to clean up the plates, Ellesandra nodded. "Thank you. Sleep well, Star." Polite, moving to pack up the plates and mess kit back up while Star headed into the tent. Star needed the sleep, after having not slept well earlier and only getting a bit of a nap on the road, so even if Ellesandra had wanted to talk more she wouldn't have stopped Star. Instead, though, she sat out by the fire as it died down, looking around for a moment, then digging in her backpack until she pulled out a small wittling knife. She'd look around for a good piece of wood to use, then would sit near the fire and slowly begin to wittle away at it. A way to keep her hands busy and mind focused on that, rather than the past, or the conversation with Star. Eventually, she would ensure the fire was completely out, her armor removed and set in the corner of the tent near her side, and slip in to rest as well, careful to stay on her side and try not to wake Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was swift to fall asleep. She slept peacefully, as she always did. No snoring, no strange noises. Just the quiet sound of her breathing, occasionally with a little sleeping sigh. Noticeably, however, she had seemed just slightly tense in the lips and eyes before Ellesandra approached. But once they were in the bed near Star? The tension left her. She seemed...Content again. Even in her sleep, it seemed she could tell if Ellesandra was nearby, though it was likely all in her subconscious mind. It might be that if Ellesandra got up again and walked away, Star might be disturbed. Time would tell. Meanwhile, Ellesandra it seemed wasn't due to have a normal slumber. Not even the expected void realm awaited her. Instead, something else entirely. There was lucidity, an awareness of the dream state. But this time, it didn't feel like a pull. It didn't feel like something snatching Ellesandra away from normality. It didn't feel like an outside influence. It didn't feel like the shadow, or like Sapphire. It felt...Natural. And in this dream, Ellesandra was wearing a tight, full-white fencing suit. Below them was a slightly raised fencing piste. Ellesandra was standing at the far edge on their side, and standing opposite Ellesandra was their opponent. Their opponent stood equal in height, and was similarly left-handed, or at least was wielding their foiled epee with their left hand for this duel. They had a feminine figure, but there was a veiled helmet obscuring their face and hair. Ellesandra had a typical fencing mask under their right arm, pinned between arm and torso, to put on when they were ready. In their left hand, a matching foiled epee. The blunted tip was coated in red chalk, and there was an expected platform next to the piste at either end with more chalk to coat the weapon's tip if needed. Alongside the piste were three unlit, standing torches per side. Three for Ellesandra, three for their opponent. The area beyond the piste was visible out to a handful of meters, illuminated by unseen light from above. Wooden flooring. The walls of this space, or what was beyond, were obscured in darkness. Ellesandra's opponent held their epee up straight before them, patiently awaiting as Ellesandra finished their preparations. And as Ellesandra was doing so, another figure walked up, coming from the edge of the shadows, to observe the match. The clack of their boots against the wooden flooring announced their presence. And as they stepped out of the light, the recognition would be instantaneous. It was none other than Sia, who looked at Ellesandra, then their opponent, then back to Ellesandra. Sia watched with a stern, neutral expression, waiting for Ellesandra to be ready and face their opponent.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra had noticed the seeming relaxation from Star when she entered the tent. Why would her presence make Star feel better? She had travelled alone, without Ellesandra or her other guardian for a while now, hadn't she? Ellesandra hadn't let herself dwell on that long, instead going to sleep with her back facing Star pretty quickly. When she felt herself move into a dream state, but could TELL she was dreaming, she looked around in confusion. Was this Black Diamond's doing? It took a few moments to take in all the details - her opponent, masked and wielding her weapon in her left hand. Her eyes narrowed, wondering if that was Marigold. She hadn't had a dream about Marigold outside of the incident in...years. Let alone dreaming about fighting her - was it because she'd thought of that recently, when explaining her use of the rapier to Star? She looked down at her own helmet, then up as Sia stepped in to apparently officiate the fight. There had been fear that the fighter across from her was Marigold, but that wasn't confirmed so it was more just trepidation. But when Ellesandra saw Sia, standing tall on the side of the field, close-cut black and grey hair that defined the words salt and pepper, looking out over both of them naturally, her stomach dropped like a bail of hay from the top of a stable loft. Ellesandra's mouth opened, then closed. She hadn't seen Sia since just before her punishment, when her mentor had talked the King and Queen down from sending Ellesandra to the gallows for hanging. She remembered the look, the disappointment in her gaze, and how Sia had only looked at her briefly, unable to maintain eye contact. So ashamed of Ellesandra's failure that she couldn't even look at her student. "Ma-" Ellesandra began to speak, more in a whisper, but Sia cut her off. "What are you doing, El? Get your helmet on and take your stance, we don't have time to dawdle and stare." The words came out sharp, commanding. A scold for Ellesandra not being prepared to start the fight in a timely manner, for not having her mind in the game. There had been more than once she'd received the same scolding when she'd been distracted before a practice bout. The familiarity of it was nice, even if seeing Sia still brought back the shame, the guilt, and...a different kind of pain. It wasn't the pain of losing Marigold - there was that, but it was minimal from the sight of Sia alone. It wasn't that Sia reminded her of Marigold, but that she'd lost the respect and faith of someone she'd looked up to her whole life. It was the closest thing she knew, in memory anyways, to losing a mother. Ellesandra's mouth closed and she felt the sharp sting of tears. New grief was coming to the surface - she'd never dreamed about Sia before, only Marigold. In the real world, there was a very quiet whimper from the knight - a sound she would never make when conscious. But she didn't have time to wallow in that; Sia turned fully towards her when Ellesandra hadn't snapped to attention to follow orders. "Ellesandra Rhinelander, you will stand tall, put your helmet on, and take your fighting stance, or it will be I in the ring with you and I will not hold back." That was a real threat. It was the punishment for students who did not follow orders; they would be reminded why they needed their training. Why Sia was their teacher, and what dedicating themselves to training could do for them. And they always left bruised and battered. Instinct and habit had Ellesandra straightening, placing the helmet on her head and turning to face her opponent. A glance was stolen at Sia out of the corner of her eye, but there didn't appear to be any comment or reference to the last time they'd seen eachother. Without another word, afraid to test even the dream version of her mentor, she stepped forward in the ring, walking to the middle with the weapon raised in front of her as was protocal and standard in polite bouts.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The bout was certainly to be a polite, proper, and official one. Ellesandra's opponent moved in lockstep, so that their approach to each other was mirrored and in perfect harmony. A little ceremony to the duel. The foils were held with the guards just below the head, out just a few inches, foils raised straight up as they approached. The opponent stopped precisely where they were meant to, precisely four meters away from Ellesandra's en garde line, then turned with a tight swivel of the heel, saluted Sia, then turned back to face Ellesandra, saluted them, then extended their right hand to shake one firm shake. Respect, chivalry, honour. These were all exemplified in this duel, as they should be. All up to a code that would be up to Sia's standards. Assuming Ellesandra could manage the same, the two were prepared for Sia to officiate and call for En Garde, ready, and begin. The warning areas were clearly marked with orange paint on the piste, with the area beyond the warning naturally resulting in a touch for the opponent if pushed back into it. Rules that doubtlessly would come back to Ellesandra like second nature, though between the unexpected presence of the officiate in question and the nature of what all this was or meant, Ellesandra's focus might be tested.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra walked out onto the field like she was trained to do. Once the muscle memory kicked in, it was easy for her to follow orders and do what was expected of her. Her mind was racing, wondering what this dream was that she was so lucid during it. Was it a creation of the Black Diamond? Seeing Sia treat her normally meant it wasn't something where Sia was aware of what was going on in present time. If she was, there would have been a much different interaction there. She turned in time to salute, but her turn back was stiff and slower than it should have been. Sia did not say anything, but in the back of her mind the 'shit' that would have been said to herself if this were real came back up. Sia might not say something about every small mistake, every move that was out of sync, but she'd make note of them, and they would be brought up later. As a duel was about to start wasn't the best place to bring up something 'minor', even though her mentor would still drill it into her not to miss it no matter how minor it was. Ellesandra took the moment of entering her stance to try to recover and focus on whoever her opponent was. Well, not who because if Ellesandra kept guessing it being Marigold simply from the left handedness and training with this type of weapon, she would make herself go crazy. But to focus on her opponent, get herself into a fighting mindset, be prepared to fight as if this were a real training duel - and to win, like she always strove to do.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Sia called out the expected phrases. En garde. Ready. Begin! Said by rote, official and rigid. The duel began, and the masked opponent gave a half second before tapping foil on foil, mostly as a signal of honour that they would not be capitalizing on a blitz or trying to take Ellesandra off guard with a cheap hit. If they were going to score, the subtlety to their actions certainly suggested they wanted it to be well-earned. As the motions began, the initial bout was fierce. Ellesandra's opponent met step for step, not giving any mercy but also not taking any cheap tactics like how some might tap their front foot to distract their opponent. Parries were met with attempts to riposte, but each strike, while well-practiced and refined, was a near miss. Ellesandra would feel the pressure. Their opponent was focused. They were capable. The bout was a back and forth of excellent motions, near-flawless movement and focused strikes. It looked like neither would get the upper hand, until one such time that Ellesandra's opponent went in for a feint, then a strike, only to have their feint be met with readiness for their strike to then be parried, opening them to a full hit from Ellesandra on the torso to leave a tiny red mark on their white jacket. The masked opponent nearly was able to evade, but just barely could not. They noticed the hit, stood straight, and extended their hand to shake again before moving back to their en garde line, turning to face Ellesandra again and begin the next bout. At this hit, one torch on Ellesandra's side of the piste burst with flames as it ignited, marking one point for Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra responded just as honorably as her opponent for the rituals. Light tap, the hand shake, all of it. As confused as Ellesandra was, and as surprised as she was to see Sia, she had spent years of her life in the training ground like this. She didn't even have to think for most of these movements to flow naturally, and she appreciated that her opponent also seemed to respect the tradition. As the fight began, Ellesandra was impressed with her opponents demeanor. She enjoyed the exchange, the give and take of a very close bout, and the pride at getting the upper hand in the end. Ellesandra truly enjoyed bouts like this, and despite the grief and shame that were still there everytime she saw Sia, there was also joy and the content feeling of the adrenaline rush in a fight. As she was declared the victor, she stepped back and ensured there was enough of the red substance at the end of her dulled blade before taking stance again. As long as she didn't look at Sia, she was fine. The sound of Sia declaring her victory was comforting and brought back many memories similar - though Ellesandra had lost plenty too. At this next set of en garde and starting rituals, Ellesandra tried to push all of that from her mind and focused on one singular thing - the duel.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The next bout began same as the first. Ellesandra's movements had settled into more routine now that the training was rushing back to them, perhaps, but the result was more predictable, if successful tactics. Conversely, their masked opponent seemed to have become shaken by the loss of the first point when they had performed so admirably. Enough that their aggression was faltering, and they focused more on the defense. This, in turn, had a predictable outcome. As they stepped back more and more to wait patiently for a mistake in Ellesandra's movements, they found none, and were pushed onto the warning line, where they were forced to either go on the offense and expose themselves, or step back in defense and lose anyway. They elected for the offense, however, but the desperate attack was all too predictable. It was still executed with competence, but with Ellesandra keeping their training in mind and performing in the vague range of 'above average' for their performance in such duels, it was a foregone conclusion once the defensive posture did not work to the opponent's favour. Another point for Ellesandra. Another shake of the hand, and another return to the en garde lines.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She'd found her groove. This time she only looked at Sia out of the expectation of confirming the call, of making the honorifcs, and moving back to their spot. Their body was humming with energy - not magical, but the type of energy you got when you were in your element. It had been so long since she'd dueled like this, not for fighting or protecting, but just to exercise her body and test her limits. She'd gotten rusty since she'd last done it, and Ellesandra knew this. Sia probably knew it, but she was winning and she felt good about that. That emotion took up everything in her, serving as a distraction coping mechanism, letting her focus entirely on the duel, and stepping forward into her opponent to try and gain the winning hit.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The tide of the duel was clear. The masked opponent was being respectful, taking their loss with grace and honour, but by the third bout? It wasn't even a contest. Their resolve had been shattered. Their repeated attempts to score a hit all being met with perfect parries and effortless dodging killed their confidence and let doubts creep in. It had grown to such a divide that the third bout lasted less than ten seconds. Strike, step, parry, and passado. Ellesandra was able to end the final bout in record time, and their opponent accepted their defeat with grace, a handshake, then set their foil down horizontally across the piste along the center line. Not really a formal or familiar motion, but a sign of complete surrender and defeat. Their masked opponent then removed their mask, and perhaps to Ellesandra's confusion, perhaps horror...It was Ellesandra staring back at them. A bruised, defeated, crestfallen Ellesandra. The image of the knight from the card Freya had created staring back at the real knight. "Congratulations," said Ellesandra's defeated self. "You fought with discipline. I'd wager we could go for a hundred rounds and I'd be lucky to score ten hits." At these words, the final of the three torches ignited on Ellesandra's side. Then, torches all around the realm of dreams ignited, showing the rectangular room for what it was. Wooden floors, stone walls, and blood spattered all around the floors that were cut up, scorched, and strewn with skeletal remains, some in armor, with cobwebs plenty scattered around. The image of a ruined castle all around them. But about one quarter of the room was different; behind a large, golden plane of shimmering magic, the one quarter of the room beyond this golden divider was clean, pristine, immaculate. And another version of Ellesandra stood on the far side of this barrier, clad in a brilliant, resplendent set of silver armor that was far more intricate than Ellesandra's typical armor. A masterwork set, with her trusty rapier at her side. Hair up in the usual ponytail, and a firm, solid look upon her face. The...Triumphant Ellesandra, it seemed, who was very gently applauding from her sequestered section beyond the veil, which was quite a bit more cramped than the decrepit, ruined castle that was home to the defeated Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did not enjoy this third round as much. Sure, she still won, but there was less victory in it. Her opponent had already been defeated mentally before they'd even touched blades, and it showed. The quick defeat and surrender did not instill the joy and excitement, the adrenaline, that the other two bouts had - especially that first one, which had been so close. And as her opponent removed her mask, Ellesandra stiffened, preparing for the worst. Would this turn into a nightmare? It probably wasn't Black Diamond's doing, or they would have somehow made it so that Ellesandra had killed Marigold. That's probably what would have happened in her nightmare too, come to think of it, so what? When she saw herself, Ellesandra took a step back in surprise. Shock was on her face and she looked around in confusion as the area changed and they were suddenly in...a castle? No, it looked more like a dungeon, at least for most of it, but then she saw the other side of the room where there was another version of her, much better armored and apparently happy, smiling, and applauding. It took a few moments for all the sights to make sense, and for her to realize that this was the card she'd been carrying - not a dream. "Oh for fucks sake!" The frustration made her roll in her sleep, arm being flung out up and to the side. In the small tent, it was inches from touching Star's cheek, but dream Ellesandra didn't know this. She was looking between the defeated and triumphant versions of herself. "Can I not own my own damn mind? First I have gems taking it over, then I have a damn card from a stranger I don't know? What is it you want?" She asked this of the versions of herself because - well. Who else was she going to ask? She didn't see Freya anywhere nearby. She swept her arm out to encompass the both of them, moving just enough in the waking world to actually brush against Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra's rolling about in the waking world that had them touch Star had been met with Star reaching out in her unconscious state, reacting to the distress she felt, to take Ellesandra's hand tenderly in her own to squeeze. And the effect this had on the dream world was that Star popped into existence in a puff of blue mist. She blinked, looking at Ellesandra...Then Ellesandra...Then Sia...Then finally the other Ellesandra, then back to the first Ellesandra. The real one. She gave a sympathetic gaze. The defeated self rolled her eyes. "What do you care? Aren't you already a glutton for punishment?" they said, their words cutting in an identical way to how the knight's own might cut when borne of their own stern emotion. "At least this dream is actually just you. You, me, that hero that'll never be you standing over there, Sia, and that annoying girl now, apparently, who you couldn't just have the presence of mind to walk away from. Even that's just all in your head. At least you didn't lose to me, 'cause then I bet Sia would be beating your ass right now." After the tirade from the defeated self, the triumphant self responded. "Don't listen to her. You've kept true to yourself, Ellesandra. True to your duty. You were raised to be a knight, and you are proving that you can be. It's a long, difficult walk back from the depths you have fallen to. But even just watching you minutes ago, you live for a challenge. You always have." Star listened to the others speak, but focused mostly on the true self. She wore sympathy, but seemed to be waiting for the knight to speak their response.

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was something ironic in that Ellesandra's movements when expressing frustration at having people invade her dreams and mind had somehow invited Star into her dream. Ellesandra spun when seeing the blue smoke appear, hand reaching for her weapon, but when she saw it was Star she groaned. The thing is, Ellesandra didn't know it was the real Star. Why would it be? Star hadn't indicated she could invade Ellesandra's dreams, so she just assumed the defeated version of herself had summoned Star as a point somehow. It was a clearing of Sia's throat that brought Ellesandra's attention back to her mentor. Sia didn't speak, but just rose her eyebrows at Ellesandra and gave her a familiar look. It was one she'd given Ellesandra plenty of times in her past, the 'I expect better of you, shape the fuck up' type of look. Ellesandra wasn't acting herself, she was letting her emotions control her responses instead of speaking to these...versions of herself. The look sent another pang of shame strongly through her. Not only for her current response, but the familiarity of that look - and how she'd never see the gentle chiding in person again. Her eyes stayed locked on Sia's face for a moment, and Star would see the struggle with emotions building. The shame weighed so heavily, now that she wasn't dueling and focusing on the joy of that. She couldn't keep looking at Sia, and turned her head to meet the gaze of her defeated self. She took in a deep breath, steadying herself as best she could, eyes closed. She couldn't see Sia right now, but if Star looked she'd see a proud smile on her face as Ellesandra stood up straight and took a familiar-to-her pose. Her right hand, palm facing towards herself, over her chest. The salute to Torm, not one she ever did anymore out of respect to the deity, but because the salute itself brought back comfort and was the pose she'd always been trained to take when she needed to take a moment to breathe and recenter herself. When she opened her eyes, her emotions were 'under control'. That being, they had been pushed down enough they weren't actively effecting her actions. Repressed, theoretically until she could deal with them later when it was appropriate, but in reality to continually be repressed. Training gone wrong, in a way. "Haughty words from someone who surrendered in our last bout. Even at my weakest I would have fought. Tried to learn from a stronger opponent. Giving up, surrendering, in a polite bout is a disgrace to the sport - a sign that you don't care to improve."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The defeated self just grinned and shook her head. "That's fucking rich. You, telling me, that I don't care to improve. Look the fuck around you," said the defeated self, opening her arms to the dead of the dungeon all around them. "This is you. I didn't choose this. You did." She then thrust her arm over to the veil. "You're one quarter the length of this room from giving up. You can't argue with me, you know. I'm YOU. And from the obvious state of this place, a lot bigger a part of you than she is," she said, flinging an arm in annoyance towards the triumphant self, who naturally responded in kind. "Don't listen to her, Ellesandra. Stand tall. Stand proud. You're strong enough to surmount all things. The path ahead will be a struggle, but it will be one that you can achieve. You just faced yourself and held your ground. You did what you were trained to do, and you did so with exemplary poise and form. You're not perfect, but you're not defeated like she is," said the triumphant self, gesturing to the defeated self. "It's just like you say. She's given up. She'll try and drag you down every step of the way, and you're the only one that can stop her from getting her way. Star is right here with you, too. You aren't alone in your fight. Stand behind the words you've JUST spoken. Your heart is on the backfoot, you're in the warning zone. If you step back now, you're surrendering. So make Sia proud, stand tall, and be a fucking woman worthy of the admiration of the people around you. Because that sad excuse for a future is what waits for you if you don't. And the only power she'll grant you is the chance to ensure your legacy will forever be a disgrace." More fervent gesturing to the defeated self, who scowled back at the triumphant self. Star meanwhile moved to stand next to Ellesandra on the flat ground. She smiled up at them. It was in truth not Star herself, not the conscious, waking self. But a manifestation of her, formed within Ellesandra's mind as an avatar of Star's soothing aura. Just looking into her eyes, seeing her hopeful and warm smile would help Ellesandra find calm, find peace in the storm of their emotions, if they needed it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra shook her head. She didn't need the 'triumphant' version of herself to say all that to encourage her. Nor did she really, fully, believe what her defeated self was saying. She did turn her eyes to look at Star when she moved in front of her, the calming peace helping to push those emotions down. The fear at letting herself open up, like the triumphant version of her wanted to. The shame and feeling like she didn't deserve it - doing exactly what the defeated version said and beating herself down. The calming presence of Star helped separate all of that, keeping Ellesandra in the moment. She looked up at the two and shook her head at them. "No. I may not be who I was before, but I'm also not you." Her gaze was focused on the defeated self's form. "Sia trained me too much to ever lay my sword down at the foot of an opponent. I haven't experienced the joy of learning in a fight for years, but even just the brief exposure in our first fight brought that back. It should have been there for you, too." Her gaze turned up to the triumphant version, and she crossed her arms, looking stern. "But you don't belong here, either. Nothing about us is triumphant. I will do my duty, but my duty is not to be the shining beacon of light and hope you seem to think you are. I'm backseat to the person who will be that, at most. My duty is to protect my charge, that is all." This triumphant, heroic version might have been the vision she had for herself when she was younger, but it no longer was. It wasn't what she wanted to be, either. That was the defeated part's influence - the belief that she didn't deserve to be like that. After she'd failed Marigold, allowed her to go off and get captured for Ellesandra's own sake, and then failed in her rescue and watched her die? She'd forsaken her own duty in the first moment, and proved her ineptitude in the second. No matter what 'glorious' acts she committed from here till her death, that would weigh her down from ever being the triumphant version, the heroic knight.

  "Neither of us is exactly who you are. But we are equal parts of you, distilled into the purest form. Even if you were to slide fully to one side or the other, you would not be us. We are simply avatars, paragons of the truths you will embody. We are here to offer you perspective. You will find power, a gift from one of us, when you come to fully embrace one of us. Either you give up, or you do not. It is a choice only you will be able to make. But the time will come where you will need to make that choice. You will not have the chance to be backseat. You will not be able to decide to surrender to mediocrity, for if you do not give it everything you have, you will become her," said the triumphant self, gesturing again to the defeated self. "She embodies all you will become if you hold yourself back. You saw her decline. She began your fight well. She fought hard. She has all of your strength, but none of your heart. So for as long as you hold onto the believe that this failure you hold onto defines you, you are destined to become her. And all you'll do if you allow that is make Sia wonder why she didn't just send you to the gallows, because then you'll have at least put an end to the pathetic image of you that still lives inside you." The triumphant self folded her arms. She didn't find Ellesandra's deflection to be a worthy answer. The defeated self just wore a look of resignation. "...Don't worry. I'll make sure that when you finally embrace me and understand it's better to just give up that our death has...Some sort of meaning," said the defeated self, looking at Ellesandra, still bruised and lightly bleeding from small cuts on her face, with resigned indifference. Star, meanwhile, frowned, and raised a hand up to take one of Ellesandra's own. She squeezed it lightly, just as she was in the waking world. She gently brushed her thumb across the back of Ellesandra's palm. "...I don't want you to give up, Ellesandra. I need you," said Star. "I will always keep fighting for you, so...I'd very much like it for you to keep fighting by my side."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had done well, pushing the shame down, pushing the memory of the last time she'd seen Sia's face. Kneeling before the King and Queen, having explained where their daughter had gone, and why. Their immediately demanding her head, and Sia stepping in. Though she'd stepped in to prevent Ellesandra's death, her recommendation had instead been the whipping. And the look of pure disappointment in her face, the way she didn't look at Ellesandra after the story, how she refused to look even in her direction. The triumphant version's mention of it slammed into her and the shame skyrocketed back up. Part of her, probably the 'defeated' part since she was looking at her, told her that the triumphant version was right. She should have just died there, killed for treason. Unintentional treason, but treason nonetheless. She'd forsaken her duty, allowed Marigold to put herself in danger for Ellesandra's benefit. It was supposed to be the other way around. That speech may have been meant to encourage her that she wasn't the defeated version of herself, but it was all about pointing out that she was. That wasn't something Ellesandra thought she could move past. Her jaw clenched and her straight, proud posture slumped, eyes turning down to the floor. She ignored the words of Star, the touch - though she didn't pull her hand away. "I'm done here. Leave me to my sleep." She didn't know if she had any power in this weird dreamscape. She didn't in the others, with Black Diamond and Sapphire, and was at their whim whether they let her go or not. Here, she didn't know the magic of Freya's, how it worked. If it was something she could simply dismiss, she would try.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The golden veil in the room began to shift, causing a small rumble in the ground as it slid more to the one side, encroaching on the triumphant side and transforming more of it to the defeated landscape. A handful of inches. It forced the triumphant self to take a step back. "Pathetic. To go from saying it isn't you, admonishing that side of you for giving up, and now doing just the same. Where has the fire gone?" she said with a click of her tongue. The defeated self looked at them for a moment, then shook her head. She walked over to the true Ellesandra and laid a hand on their shoulder. "Don't listen to her. It's all right. We rightly bear our shame. You can sleep now." And with that, the world around Ellesandra went black, except for Star. The two stood on equal ground again. Star looked off into the black void of nothingness around them, then slowly moved to slide her arms around Ellesandra. Her presence brought with it a wave of calm, something to soothe and remove the edge from the shame and guilt in their heart. It didn't stop them from feeling it, but her hold was a comforting shield against the crushing weight as lucidity slipped away from Ellesandra again, and they then were surrendered to the valley of their dreams. Dreams which, as the two continued to hold hands, would still carry Star's calming presence. No matter what Ellesandra dreamed of that night, and they would get a chance to dream this time, Star would be present in the dream, and no matter how hard Ellesandra's mind might try to conjure ways for Star to be hurt or killed or whatever else that might torture Ellesandra, her presence would prove resilient. Unrestrained by the constraints of reality, her power within the dreamscape was endless to fight back against anything that dared try to torture Ellesandra. If it was Ellesandra killing Marigold, Star was there to heal the princess and save them. If it was Sia's abandonment, Star was there to stand before the king and queen and argue with all her heart for Ellesandra. It might not be enough to stop Ellesandra from feeling the pain, but no matter what torturous visions greeted the woman in the night, Star would never cease fighting for the knight in her own way, and nothing would be able to harm the woman herself either, for blades bounced off her shimmering aura and illness was purified and expunged and hurtful words were met with stubborn, righteous fury to stand and fight for Ellesandra, no matter the odds.
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was right. The fire had gone out, as soon as those emotions had come back up, past her barriers. It was why she didn't let herself feel them, subconsciously. Oh, it was never a conscious thought of 'don't feel these or you won't be able to come out of your depression'. But it was just a gut feeling, a knowing, that if she truly surrendered and let everything come up, to process like Star did, she wouldn't be able to. She didn't have the emotional resilience that Star did. Most of all, the only way she'd survived Marigold's death, hadn't killed herself in her shame and guilt and grief, was by not feeling it. That type of trauma stayed with you, and for someone who had never been taught how to process that emotion, but only to work it out through training or her work? Well, what was left but to work - and so turned Ellesandra into the stoic, distant and guarded defender of her clients. She didn't respond as either of her true selves spoke to her, eyes remaining down and pointedly away from where Sia was, who had been oddly silent during this entire exchange. There had been facial expressions, which in reality was how Sia communicated a lot of the time. A woman of few words, one that Ellesandra had learned from well. Yet, Ellesandra couldn't bring herself to look at her mentor, and thus wouldn't see them. As the dreamscape disappeared and she was surrounded by blackness, she was surprised that Star was there. Annoyance flickered across her face for a moment. She wanted to be alone, to cry and push her feelings down again, but once again Star was there. The hug, the embrace, was unexpected. The gentle touch brought the emotional vulnerability that Ellesandra tried so hard to avoid, to stay away from. It caused her to have to hold back a sob, jaw clenched. IN the real world, holding Star's hand still, Ellesandra curled up into the fetal like position, knees up to her chest like how Star had seen her in the fields. And then the dreams came. With her mind so focused on it, it was indeed the scene in the throne room that came to her in her dreams. It was never true to what actually happened - but what Ellesandra felt everyone said. Ellesandra, kneeling on one knee with her head low, not looking up at the King or Queen, and Sia standing off to the Queen's side as the Queen's own guard during public events. This wasn't public, though. Her, essentially saying "I killed Marigold, I'm sorry." and the King and Queen claiming she'd killed their daughter, and Sia saying she was a disgrace but ought to live in her disgrace, not die for it. No matter that Star defended her, the dream Ellesandra didn't make any form of progress in saying anything but that she killed Marigold herself, and that she was sorry.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's influence was not a logical one. It was emotional. A pillar of support, a bastion unshakeable. The manifestation was her presence in defense of Ellesandra, but extended beyond it. The ability to completely upend a nightmare and turn it into a positive dream, to shatter reality. So it was that what was real became secondary, and Star punched through a hole in the throne room wall, revealing a portal through which she jumped and returned a few seconds later hand in hand with Marigold, looked defiantly to everyone present, and carefully led Marigold to stand in the middle of the throne room. "Look, see? She's not dead. She never died. Ellesandra did nothing wrong." Marigold then just dusted herself off a little, smiling to Ellesandra. "And now we're all going to have tea together, so enough with all this sadness!" decreed the auramancer, evoking no questions from the others present, as her calming influence fought hard against the tide of nightmarish woe. In the real world, Star rolled to her side, shuffling closer. One hand held their hand, the other unconsciously looped around the knight. She was still asleep, but she shifted to a comforting hold as she felt the growing need for such comforts. It wasn't enough to mend the broken heart of the knight. But it kept the tide of sorrow at bay. It turned the nightmare into a dream where Ellesandra could walk with Marigold again, enjoy time together in a field of flowers, to keep company as Marigold and Star sat at a table with tea and scones, talking about all manner of girly things and giggling mirthfully. Star's presence was minimal, keeping a focus on providing a few moments of reprieve from the nightmare, to let Ellesandra experience happiness with the princess in both good memories that were real, and made up ones that were just...Pleasant. Each time Ellesandra's mind might try to reinforce the pain, Star's influence fought back to let Ellesandra just sleep. To just let them have peace in the night.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Somehow, Marigold being alive, being able to spend time together, made Ellesandra even more emotional. Happy emotional, but emotional nonetheless. Still, she wasn't cognizant, lucid in these dreams, and her dream form would enjoy as much of them as they could. Sleeping, without the conscious ideas and thoughts of keeping a distance, Ellesandra curled up into Star's hold, close enough that she was all but holding onto Star herself. The dreams would change a few times, going from one pleasant one to something bad happening then Star's presence somehow making it positive again. Still, after the third attempt her dreams seemed to settle into the pleasant, apparently with Star, Marigold, and Ellesandra having tea and finger foods during a picnic, out in a field not too far off from the one Star and Ellesandra had been in. There was a castle in the distance, but no one else around. Through the night as the pleasant dreams took over, Ellesandra had eased up in her holding of Star, but had not let go. So when she woke up in the morning, holding onto Star, the slow awareness that came to her of what was happening caused her squint at Star, then immediately tense and straighten, muscles becoming stiff and the discomfort of the holding becoming apparent.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's influence ensured that Ellesandra woke pleasantly. A gentle, guiding energy to keep the sadness at bay, even if doing so required filling their heart with happiness enough to make it swell instead. All of it was never forced, but the power of her emotional soothing rarely met a heart it could not settle, for the unconscious mind was easy to take by the hand and gingerly guide to happier places. So it was, when they woke, the initial sensations would be pleasant. Unfortunately, pesky consciousness ensured Ellesandra was tense upon realizing the tender state the two women shared in the night. Star felt the distress, and it slowly stirred her from her slumber. Her face tensed a little, then slowly did her eyes peek open. Sleepy eyes looked at Ellesandra. Recognition was...Slowly kicking in. There was time enough for Ellesandra to slip away, though if they didn't, Star's sleepy self wasn't in a rush to do so. "Mmmnh..?" Still a bit too sleepy to really understand what was happening.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra may have drifted into a waking state pleasantly, but now that her mind had caught up to the fact she'd been cuddling up to Star, holding her, Ellesandra's stiffness was awkward and, well, tense. She was frozen, not sure what to do. If she jerked away, it would surely wake Star, so she resisted just jerking away. Could she extract herself softly without bothering her? Her eyes trailed down to where her head had been resting, curled up close to Star's chest, and she saw wetness there. Tear stains? The dream last night, well the fake dream part of it where she'd been seeing two different versions of herself, Sia, and Star, came back to her then. The reminder of her shame hit full force and she immediately moved to release star, breaking contact to try to prevent Star from feeling that any more than she'd already be able to do so just by looking at her. Star had apparently already started to wake up, but Ellesandra didn't notice, moving to climb out of the tent and ignoring any jostling, hoping that it would just be Star rolling over in her sleep. Outside of the tent, she grabbed the piece of wood she'd been wittling the night before. It had been cut down into the shape of a typical 'star', with 5 points. She moved it to the side so it wouldn't get caught in any campfire or anything, and set about making a fire for the morning, at least until or if Star interrupted her. Focusing on something to do, on work, would help her focus her mind away from the memories. The pleasant dreams with Marigold and Star, which seemed to hurt even more now that they weren't real, and the reminder of how she couldn't look at Sia, how the defeated version of herself seemed to just get stronger in the dream last night, the triumphant one losing space. Her heart ached, but she tried to push that down with work.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly didn't need to touch Ellesandra to see that rush of shame. The aching heart, all of this, was enough to bring Star to the waking world. She didn't mind the knight slipping away. It was perhaps preferable to them deciding to get upset and defensive about the state they woke up in. Star wasn't far behind them of course, trying to sort through the emotions that she had held onto through the night. Shame...Pain...Happiness...There was a lot to recall, though the purpose of it all, the cause of it all, was lost on her. She also had her own dreams to content with, unknown to Ellesandra. So it was with languid motions that she joined Ellesandra at the campfire, sitting nearby and yawning. She might have thought to say something, but then she noticed the whittled 5 pointed star. She obviously knew what her own name was, so even sleepy brain couldn't stop the instant connection, which just shut her up before she could speak and splattered a bright red blush on her cheeks.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over only briefly when Star exited the tend before going back to setting up the campfire. She set it up to cook some breakfast, though it was mostly roasting some vegetables and eating fruits for breakfast this morning. She didn't say anything despite seeing that Star was blushing and noticed the wooden star. When everything was setup, she moved to grab a log and sit down nearby, taking the star and the wittling knife that had been left out near it, and starting on shaving a bit from one of the points to even it all out. It wasn't quite done, but was decently close to being so. It was while she was focusing on this, eyes on the star, that she finally spoke again. "So, was that my dreams bringing you up on their own, or did you step into my mind while we slept?" It was important to know whether that was actually Star, and if she remembered any of it, or if it was just her own mind bringing Star into the equation. Or perhaps the magic of the card - either way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star didn't say anything as Ellesandra set about doing the morning routine. She had learned in her time with the knight that she couldn't just...Brazenly barge against every negative emotion Ellesandra felt and tackle it head on like she could for others. She had to consider it. Think on it. Let Ellesandra have their time, as well. The question that came evoked some confusion, however. She tilted her head slightly. "Eh? I was in your dreams?" That about answered the question on its own, but she then shook her head to make it clear. "I didn't step into your mind, no. Putting aside that you need to allow me to do that to do things like share memories, I wouldn't do it without you agreeing to it." She wouldn't be able to, but she wanted to specifically emphasize that she also just wouldn't do so even if she could. It did sting in her heart that she had to constantly reinforce to Ellesandra that she wasn't ever going to willfully breach their privacy, but she also knew it was obviously important to the knight, so she just kept that pain to herself to let it pass through her heart in time.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She was quiet while working, listening to Star's answer and then letting the silence stretch for another moment or two afterwards. The star in her hand was turned and another imperfection worked on, letting the soothing morning air comfort her. Ellesandra felt awkward, a little embarrassed by how she'd woken up cuddling up against Star, and still feeling both confused and upset by the dreams last night. Finishing the last little bit of imbalance, then she held it out to Star. "I know you said you wouldn't do it intentionally, but since it happened during sleep I wasn't sure it was something else that might have been unintentional." She had kept talking, to distract from Star commenting on how Ellesandra had literally made her a star. It hadn't started out as that intention, just what Ellesandra had started doing and finding it turned into that. A subconscious thing, but Ellesandra was not going to examine why, and she didn't really want to explain to Star she had no real reason for making it for her - just felt it was right. "I had a dream related to that magical card Freya gave me, and you were part of it. Just wanted to know if you were aware of that, or not." It would have revealed things about herself that she didn't want Star to know. If she did, Ellesandra wasn't sure she could stop the prying from the empathic woman.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could, for the better part of an afternoon, talk to Ellesandra entirely about this wooden star, what it meant to her, and what it meant that Ellesandra made it for her in the first place, subconsciously or not, but she wasn't in the mood to argue with Ellesandra. Instead, her eyes got misty, she hugged the wooden carving to her chest with both arms, and she cried a little. No sobbing, just silent tears from an overwhelmed heart. She sniffled. "N-No, m'not...I-I'd really like it if...Erm...It might be important to figure out what it meant, i-if you wanna...Talk about it..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
There was a moment of concern when Star started crying. Had she done something wrong? Ellesandra watched her warily, taking a moment to come to the conclusion that they weren't sad or upset tears. She took in a deep breath and shook her head, unsure how Star let herself feel so strongly. It would kill Ellesandra to feel as strongly as Star did, to cry like that at something as simple as being gifted a wooden star. She turned to the food and began putting it on plates, serving one over to Star and waving her question away. "Symbolic needless exercise of fighting my defeated self and my triumphant self apparently encouraging me to be the hero you see me as." Okay, so it didn't take Star's power to see that Ellesandra wasn't telling the whole truth. Her jaw clenched at the memories of the dream again and she didn't meet Star's gaze, even as handing over the food then moving to sit and eat herself. Her question had been answered; Star didn't remember what had happened in the dream. Her past was safe, and she wasn't going to have to explain anything to her. There was relief there, not needing to open up, being able to keep it all bottled closed.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The star was engulfed in soft white light as she listened to the reply. It vanished moments later into motes of light that dissipated. Off to her magical storage space it went for safe keeping before she accepted her plate. She still had some tears, but it was drying up. She responded with a gentle voice: "I can't tell sometimes if you've forgotten that I can easily tell when someone is lying to me, or telling a half truth, or if you just do that knowing full well this fact and are just implying the rest of it is off limits." She wasn't holding an accusing tone with those words. It was just one part reminder, one part her saying flat out she knew there was more to it. "...Sounds like I would get along pretty well with that triumphant self of yours."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra stopped eating, looking up at Star directly at the callout. "The latter." She said this flatly, knowing that Star would have been able to tell if she tried to imply anything other than the truth here. "It's nothing against you, Star. I just don't share or talk about it, with anyone." This was said softer, trying to reduce any of the blow from her confirming the rest was simply off limits. There was a bit of it that saying that was lying to herself too, to try to pretend it was something as simple as that even if it wasn't, but that wasn't a conscious decision. She looked back down at her plate, eating more and chewing thoughtfully while thinking of the triumphant version of herself. "I'm not sure about that. She was a bit full of herself. High and mighty, and demeaning. If that's who I turn out to be, I'm sorry."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft frown at the flat response. Even them saying it was nothing against her, it did still spoil her appetite a little. She still ate, goodness knowing Ellesandra would yell at her otherwise. But between the night before and this morning, she felt like her heart was buried in a foot of mud. She did at least grin a little at Ellesandra's description. "I've met the sort. But I'm fairly sure that all of the possible permutations that you could reasonably turn out to be are versions of you that I could get along with, so long as it's the same you at the core." Was she going to elaborate more on that? Didn't seem so. Just kept going with the usual topic change that was too abrupt to let the other topic be lingered on. "There's a lot you don't share or talk about. I'm still going to insist that it's the wrong path, the wrong way to handle it. But I also don't have the emotional strength to argue with you, so...Feel free to move along to something practical." There was a lingering sadness in her voice as she spoke those words. She didn't like anything about...Any of this. It was a resigned acceptance to the struggles she faced against Ellesandra's brick wall of a heart.

The frown seemed to hit Ellesandra. Not physically of course, but the more she saw Star get upset at Ellesandra's barriers, the worse Ellesandra felt for them. It wasn't that she regretted having those barriers; she was confident and certain in her desire and need to have them. She did, however, dislike how much it upset Star that she kept those boundaries firm. "I don't think I could get along with any of my own selves." She said honestly, remembering how irritated she'd been at her Defeated self for giving up, and then at how mighty her victorious self had been. So self-centered and important. A snort came at the thought of ever being like that, and she focused on finishing up her plate while considering how to approach this new awkward tension with Star. "Star, I'm not sure how to approach this. I'm not comfortable sharing, not because I don't trust you, but because sharing makes me address it and I can't do that, okay? It's best left repressed and in the past. I'll do what I can to make that not an issue between us, but you being able to see my emotions makes all my normal methods of dealing with it useless in hiding or repressing it, because you still see it. So if there's a middle ground where you're more comfortable with, let me know."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	There were a lot of ways that Ellesandra could have addressed the tension, but them saying what, to Star, just boiled down to 'I trust you but I'm also dying inside and there's nothing anyone can do about it and you just have to accept it' nearly had Star lash out in anger. Indeed, the tension in her was visible, and more than that, her aura pulsed outward, visible for the moment to Ellesandra and it shone with a brilliant, bright crimson. It was rare for Star's emotions to bleed into visibility when she wasn't meditating, but it was a brief glimpse for Ellesandra what it was like to be Star. Still, Star wasn't angry directly at Ellesandra. She knew that. She wasn't about to go and blame the victim for their suffering. She only wished she had an audience with some of the people in Ellesandra's past. But even then, she didn't know who. She drew in a soft breath, then exhaled through her mouth. Her aura slowly subsided from visibility again. "...I hope you realize what you just said sounds like me trying to give you tips on how to fight with your rapier," she said, only once she had let her anger flow through and out of her, so she could carry a light tone to her words. Gentleness and kindness were how she wanted to address those words. "Emotions have been...Central to my entire life, I'm sure that's not so surprising to hear. So you have to understand that when I say things like I know when someone's lying, that includes me knowing when someone is lying to themselves." She moved to hug her knees to her chest as she spoke, not looking at Ellesandra directly, but occasionally flicking her eyes to them, then back to the fire. "I'm still not...Going to argue with you about this. You can-- You SHOULD feel however you want to feel about it. But insisting it's best left repressed and in the past is an affront to everything I've ever known, everything I've ever been taught." She still smiled. A combination of tone and reassurance that said this wasn't her casting blame at Ellesandra. "Nobody can force you to face it. And I'd certainly never want to just throw you or anyone who has such deep trauma into it all at once. That sort of emotional turmoil makes people do rash things." She gently shook her head. "No I...I said it before, and I really just need you to trust me when I say that emotions can be an immense source of strength, or they can be a sapping, sickly, virulent poison. And that doesn't just go away when it poisons you so, it just...Gets worse, as poisons do." She paused a moment, smiling as she looked at the fire. "I want to be clear I'm not pushing you right now. I'm just...Expressing myself. But I'm not just talking from nowhere, you know. Things like this are quite literally what define my gift. And if that wasn't enough, well...I saw it for myself. You, facing the pain inside. Back in the elven settlement. I'm sure that was just the surface of it, just the tiniest part of it. And it hurt, a lot. I saw for myself. And I don't think I told you but, that pain you felt left a wispy trail of memory behind. I didn't peer into the memory, of course," she said, shaking her head again. "I told you I wouldn't, and I wasn't really planning on telling you, because me acting in good faith of your trust is just...How it is. But, I guess it's relevant here. Anyway, I was...Just bringing that up because it's just, well...Proof that you can address it. It's probably the most unpleasant thing you can think of doing, but...You CAN face it. It just takes...A lot of tears, a lot of pain, a lot of it feeling worse before it gets better. For me at least, when I face things that hurt me deeply, it's really helped me that you could hold me through them." She smiled, looking at Ellesandra again. "So again I just...Needed to say all that, not to push you. Just to let you hear me. There might be a lot I'm still naiive about, but...When it comes to emotions, I'm about as expert as they come. Even if your heart is screaming at you to tell me I'm wrong, and you might still do that...I know I'm not."
</p>

  <h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra physically flinched when Star's aura suddenly erupted around her. The red was obvious, though Ellesandra wasn't entirely certain what emotion that was associated with. Frustration? Anger? She looked away, at her empty plate, and then set it aside and took a deep breath. She listened to Star, not looking at her through the entire explanation, but she strongly disagreed with it. How was she supposed to address the emotions, the past, when it was so overwhelming? Yes it was a poison, but letting it slowly seep out and poison her was less harmful than just drinking the poison entirely. At least, that's how she felt. Sure, she recognized Star was better with emotions, understood them better and how to process, but she just couldn't do what Star suggested. The idea of how much pain there was, the fear and trepidation at facing those memories...she shook her head. "Star, I-." She paused not quite sure what to say. It felt like she should say something, respond to what Star said, but she had no response. She knew Star was right in theory, but in practice? Ellesandra was trained to keep her emotions down, she honestly didn't know how to open up with them. And to just let that much pain open? It was stupid to do. Best not to feel it, and be able to continue with their journey. With Star's mother confirmed captured, they needed to make time - not spend useless hours comforting Ellesandra. She chewed on her inside cheek for a moment before standing and picking up her whittling knife. "We've got work to do. We can revisit this topic when it's done." Well, that wasn't a 'shut up I'll never do that', but it also was a long way away, most likely, before they found Star's mother so it might as well have been. She began taking down camp and putting her armor back on, trying to let the morning routine calm her back down and also trying not to look in Star's direction, knowing she would likely be hurt by the dismissal again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was specifically watching Ellesandra as she concluded her words so she could watch her prediction unfold. The doubt. The fear. The trepidation. She smiled a knowing smile. She expected this result. She was okay with it. So truly, Ellesandra deflecting was among the better responses. Part of her worried her insistence would just cause Ellesandra to up and run away, though she knew that was more fear than logic talking. She stood up when Ellesandra did and intercepted them. She moved behind them and looped her arms around their midsection for a moment, hugging up against their back. Emotional walls were solid. Star was okay. She just...Wanted a hug. "It's okay, Ellesandra." What was okay? She didn't specify. She just released the hold and let Ellesandra get to their work. She cleaned up a little where she could, putting her bedroll back away to magical fairy land, but left the heavy lifting to Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had not been expecting the hug. She stiffened immediately, the discomfort with the touching and potential emotional sharing very evident. Her arms were held out awkwardly as she was hugged, as if she didn't know what to do with them having been caught off guard. There was a part, a very small part, of her that wanted to relax into the hold. To enjoy the physical touch of another person for more than just pleasure. It had been years since she'd let herself relax like that, to be held and comforted. Obviously, that didn't happen. She awkwardly stepped away from Star when the hold was released, having never returned it. She watched Star with confusion obvious, not sure where the hug had come from. And what was okay? Just that Ellesandra was herself and drew barriers? That was good, because that wasn't going to change. She watched Star put her bedroll away, then moved off to continue taking down camp. She felt uncomfortable with the conversation they'd just had, how raw her emotions felt between that and her dream last night, and also uncomfortable with the dream of Star and Marigold getting along together, having a little picnic. It was a happy dream, but in the waking world, letting herself think about it, it induced some of that grief. That such a thing could never happen anymore. Her lips pursed, and eventually she finished packing up and turned to face Star, fully armored again and weapon on her hip. "Are you ready?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star naturally didn't need the physical connection to see Ellesandra's awkwardness, and desire to relax in the hold. It made Star smile. It might be small, but it was something. A small something. A small something that could grow into a bigger something, if nurtured. Star had things she was uncomfortable with, but unlike Ellesandra she was able to work through those things in her heart and be okay with things again for now. Genuinely fine, not just...Repressed and bottled up fine. She nodded to Ellesandra, ready to move along with them. The passage to the ruins marked on the map wasn't too long of a trek. Another hour moving through the foliage until the path leveled out and gave way to a clearing and the remnants of what was once, long ago, a road. Patchy grass now covered it, but the smoother ground alluded to what it once was before nature reclaimed it all. In the clearing beyond, there were overgrown, stony ruins that were crumbling from the passage of time. But before Ellesandra and Star could enter, a magical pulse flashed on the ground in the shape of a magical circle inscribed with all manner of glyphs and mystic shapes, and from it rose a spectral dire wolf. The creature was ethereal and blue in hue and slightly transparent, measuring about four feet from paw pad to spine. It stood just before, barring entry, what appeared to be a crumbling archway leading into the ruins proper. But it wasn't attacking. Just standing horizontally facing Star and Ellesandra, defensive. Its eyes were bright blue, solid orbs of mana that had wispy lines running upwards, further reinforcing the creature's magical nature. Before any rash actions could be taken, though it was likely Ellesandra's blade was already drawn, a voice projected from the wolf. The wolf's mouth wasn't moving, however, so it was more likely another source for the voice projected through the creature: "Halt! This area is under security of the First Crusaders," said the decidedly feminine voice that...Did not at all match the image of an imposing dire wolf. "Identify yourself and state your business, or leave now."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She led the way, keeping an eye on their surroundings as they walked. In nature, you less had to worry about someone ambushing you, and usually more about beasts. She kept her eyes peeled for both while leading, but it really wasn't a long trek from their camp to the ruins. In theory they could have easily made it before too late last night, but considering the exhaustion from previous days it was safer to go ahead and rest before heading over, just in case something happened. This was even more reinforced when, upon approaching the stony ruins, a magical pulse flashed on the ground. Ellesandra's hand dropped to her rapier, not drawing it but preparing to if it was needed. The spectral dire wolf appearing caused her to shift back into a defensive stance, but still she had not drawn her blade. The magic was not necessarily hostile, even if it was most likely hostile. When it stood before them, she ensured Star was behind her and not easily approachable by the roof. Additionally, she checked their surroundings to ensure no one else had approached at the creation of this wolf, but otherwise looked back towards the wolf. She didn't answer it, but instead left the speaking to Star, hand still resting on her rapier. It was Star's mission, after all, and she was also the one better at speaking to people - and creatures. Even if this was likely a magical wolf, Ellesandra's way of talking to people and simply demanding entrance probably wouldn't be the best received. So, Ellesandra was silent, only glancing briefly at Star out of the corner of her eye to ensure she was safe and prepared to speak to it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was briefly startled, but she had safety behind Ellesandra. The demands from the wolf, or rather whoever had summoned the wolf, had her step just slightly to the side to ensure the being could see her as she spoke. A sign of non-hostility, though she was able to keep behind Ellesandra in a moment's notice if needed. "My name is Star, and this is Ellesandra. We come seeking travelers from Myst. We aim to travel to Myst, but as I understand one needs to be guided there," said Star. A few moments of silence passed. "Why did you come here looking for such things?" was the response. "Someone observed such travelers in this place. A friend of ours, a scholar," came Star's reply, not mentioning a name or where the man lived just in case. Another pause. "...I bet it was Ayden, bumbling around, probably flirted with them or something," came a mumble, the sort of thing one muttered to themselves not realizing they could be heard. "Fine," resumed the projected voice. "Come in, we can talk. Keep your weapons sheathed." And with that, the dire wolf burst into blue light, vanishing.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't quite sure what to make of the wolf mumbling to itself. It was obviously some form of mouthpiece for whatever magic user was casting it, and there was definite amusement when it mumbled about someone named Ayden bumbling around and flirting with strangers. She glanced back at Star when they were invited in, and though she had never actually drawn her weapon, she kept her hand resting on it. Despite the invitation in, Ellesandra didn't trust like that - and whoever was in there obviously had use of magic, so they could be walking into a trap. It was with that in mind that Ellesandra would take a step closer to Star, almost to where their arms were brushing as she began walking forward. "Feel free to do the talking, unless you're threatened." She mumbled out of the side of her mouth. It was an invitation to be the talker of the group, since that wasn't exactly something Ellesandra was good at or did a lot of. Instead, she did what she was good at. She kept her eyes peeled, figurative hackles up and ready to pounce in front of Star at the smallest sign of hostility from anyone within. One of the gems had indicated that Myst might be dangerous - she didn't remember or really care which one - even if Black Diamond's own group wasn't there.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to Ellesandra, then began walking. Through the crumbling archway, the ruins were all above-ground. A remnant of a settlement, it seemed. One that was sectioned into four quadrants, with main roads leading from the center in all four cardinal directions. Star and Ellesandra walked in through the remains of buildings that were slowly coming to be reclaimed by nature. Just stone remained, the wood having rotted and crumbled years upon years ago no doubt. At the center of this ruined city was a central fountain, though it too was understandably broken down and in shambles. Barely even a fountain at this point, just the majority of a marble circle overgrown with moss and vines and a vague shunt of marble rising from the middle that at one point was the central spout. Standing around this fountain was a woman in a tight dress with a frilly skirt holding a coiled whip in one hand, arms crossed. There were two floating blue orbs floating near her, each with the same eyes of blue mana, though these orbs had little mouths. One looked worried, the other had fang-like jagged lines and a devilish grin about it. Safe to assume it was the person speaking to them. This person observed Star and Ellesandra with caution as they approached. Nobody else seemed to be present in this large remnant of the city. When Star and Ellesandra drew within a respectable distance, the woman held up a palm, signaling them to halt. It gave a wide berth so either side could react if things went south. "Wait there. I've called the captain to come speak to you."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took some time while walking in, taking in how the ruins looked. Ruins were always risky for adventurers, and she'd tended to avoid them in her travels. She had taken one job to guard a merchant going into one with the goal of getting the treasure inside and it hadn't quite ended swimmingly. No one had died, but it had been a close call, so it was with this suspicion and concern that she kept her eyes scanning the environment around them. In one way it was sad, thinking about the history destroyed by nature, no longer kept up by whoever used to live or settle here, the potential death of multiple people to lead to this place being abandoned at some point in the past. A sign of time and how things changed, and never really lasted. Ellesandra wasn't here to sight see though, turning her attention to the woman greeting them. She eyed the weapon, and then the two blue orbs floating around her. Was one of them the wolf they'd just encountered? Or had manifested as such? Ellesandra did as asked originally, not drawing her weapon, but her left hand rested on the pommel in a forced relaxed posture. A silent nod was all that was given to the woman at her request to wait, standing still close to Star. She was happy to wait for whatever captain, as it would make this faster rather than having to explain their story and goal to multiple people. And the faster they got through all of this, the faster they'd be closer to their goal - and less likely they'd get attacked on the way.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star kept quiet while they waited, keeping her hands easy at her sides and in view. She didn't want to make this into a problem, so she kept to herself how CUTE she found the ears sitting on top of this woman's head. The wait wouldn't be long; a portal opened suddenly near the fountain, a swirling mass of blues and blacks inside a ring of tight white lines of light. Through it stepped another woman. Sporting the same ears as the first woman, this captain was...Tall. The girl with the wavy blue hair was about five-two, but the captain stood a towering six-three. She easily towered over the other three women present. She had armored greaves, sabatons, vambraces, and gauntlets, along with pauldrons that sported a single spike on just the left one. A long spear rest diagonally across her back, secured in place by magic. The captain moved one gauntleted hand to her hip as she sized up Ellesandra and Star with her scarlet eyes. "Right then," began the captain. "Let's get introductions out of the way. I'm captain Amara Sunsong of Myst's First Crusaders. This is Amelia," she said, gesturing to the blue-haired woman. Star responded in kind, introducing herself and Ellesandra with first names. No special titles. "What business do you have in Myst?" asked Amara. "I'm hoping to find a way from there to my home realm. I was cast away from there a long time ago and have been trying to get back," said Star. Amara then addressed Ellesandra. "And you? Is this your home realm? What is your business?" Amara spoke with authority and rigidness that was befitting a military captain. Discipline oozed out of her every pore, and given she was addressing Ellesandra directly, Star naturally kept quiet to let them answer for themselves.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra honestly thought the ears were adorable as well, but never in a million years would she comment on that. As the portal opened, Ellesandra stiffened, prepared for the worst but not assuming it would happen. Getting too defensive might put their hosts on alert that something was wrong, after all. And really, nothing was - Ellesandra was just cautious. As the tall woman stepped out of the portal, she took a moment to assess her. Armored, strong posture, obviously in charge. It was easy to respect the authority, even if the woman had no actual authority over Ellesandra herself. Training kicked in and though Ellesandra had been silent, watching the interaction between this Amara and Star, she spoke up quickly when Amara directed a question to her. "Yes ma'am, the one we're currently in is my home realm. My business is directly aligned with Star's, as I have been hired as her bodyguard for the journey. Her mission as such is mine." A united front, one that Ellesandra would always give to strangers when it came to Star. Even if they were upset with eachother or disagreed in regards to how to handle emotions, Ellesandra would always be at Star's side when needed. On her side. She didn't speak more or add any more, only answering the question that had been asked and not adding unnecessary detail. Despite the respect she was offering someone of obvious command authority, her hand had not left her rapier. She respected authority, but it did not mean that the authority could not be wielded against them.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara took note of the posture. She didn't seem put on guard by Ellesandra keeping a hand near their blade, but that was in part thanks to the distance. Enough that she would be able to draw her spear with time to spare. "Understood," said Amara. "Then the next consideration is as follows: Myst is not a place that will tolerate uncivil behaviour. While in Myst, physical altercations of any degree will be met with imprisonment. Drawing a weapon for any reason other than self-defense or defense of another will similarly be considered a crime. It is a safe place with no room for hostility. As such, there is what is known as a dampening field within Myst. It will suppress your ability to use magic of any sort; it does not neutralize your magic nor siphon it in any way, but you will not be able to form your mana into any useable spell while in Myst. If either of you have any magic that is required to sustain you and your natural state or anything of that ilk, you need to inform me now so accommodations may be looked into." Amara then paused, looking at Star, then Ellesandra. Star gently shook her head, not seeing any problem with the terms nor finding the notion of her magic being suppressed to be an issue. "Remind me to get our money out to leave with you before we go," was all she had to say, directed to Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched the woman, nodding to the rules listed. They made sense, and also made her thankful she hadn't been aggressive enough to draw her blade on the magical wolf. She shook her head at the magic comment, none of her magic being absolutely necessary for any reason other than used in a fight. She had used her penetratic strike to cut food before, but the chances of that being needed were extremely low. A nod was given to Star, and she responded in a low voice. She wasn't trying to keep the conversation hidden from the two Myst natives, they could still hear it, but making it obvious the comment wasn't directed at then. "Best not to get all of it, the risk for pickpocketing is higher on our physical forms than in your storage. Don't forget to get anything else we might need out of your storage as well; your bedroll for example. We can strap it to the top of my bag." It was likely they would be sleeping in taverns and inns for the most part, but there was always a chance they'd have to camp out somewhere and she didn't want Star to forget that. Turning to look back to Amara, she nodded her understanding to the rules and expectations, and finally relaxed her posture. Oh she was still watching, wary, but she dropped her hand back down to her side rather than resting on her weapon.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Things were going well it seemed. Amara and Amelia were certainly not threats. Amelia might look a little bored, maybe a tiny bit grumpy, but that looked like it could just be resting bitch face. Amara kept a stern air about her, but she was acting in a language Ellesandra likely understood. She had duty to fulfil, and a no-nonsense approach to get it done. But seeing Ellesandra drop their hand, Amara gave a smile. She understood the silent assurance of...Perhaps not trust, but at least an understanding they weren't hostile to each other. But the calm peace was interrupted by a tingle in Ellesandra's mind. The shadow. It was approaching, and fast. Fast enough that it was nearly on top of Ellesandra by the time it could register on their mind; a portal opened a ways off the fountain, and a tall man stepped through who bore the essence of the shadow. Specifically, it resonated with the essence of the Blood Emerald, which Ellesandra was familiar with from the one dream on the ship. The man in question wore a set of fine clothes, including a fetching hat atop his head of bright green hair, which matched his eyes. He wore a shit-eating grin as he stepped towards the other four. Amelia and Amara jumped to stand on guard, with Amara jumping ahead of Amelia as she drew her spear. Amelia kept behind Amara, immediately channeling her mana to send pulses outwards that saw three humanoid, fey-like spirits with featureless faces and feminine figures summoned in the air, all facing this intruder. Mana glowed in the hands of these three fey summons, which were blue and slightly transparent just as the wolf had been, a mixture of different elemental bolts that were ready to be flung at Amelia's command; Amelia was clearly an arcane summoner of some measure. Star kept close to Ellesandra of course, but no attacks had been slung initially. The man opened his arms to the group. "Well, what a welcome that is!" he said with a boisterous voice and a chuckle. "Ellesandraaaaaa...Where are you?" he said, making a show of putting one hand to his forehead as if blocking the sun and looked left, then right, then left, then looked directly at Ellesandra. "Ah, there you are! You're so short, I'm sorry, I almost didn't see you. You've been...Naughty, you know. It's almost like...You were about to go to Myst, like you weren't even listening to the warnings!"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The feeling of the shadow resulted in an immediate flash of panic in Ellesandra's emotions. The shadow being nearby, and approaching nonetheless, was NOT a good thing. So while it was probably at the same time as the person appeared through the portal, Star would have surely gotten a flash of something being wrong from Ellesandra. Her hand went straight to her weapon again and she turned to face the man, drawing it without giving him the same courtesy as she had the two ladies from Myst. She'd given them the benefit of the doubt while being on guard; the Blood Emerald got no such thing. She knew, for a fact, that he was not on their side, and had the potential to be hostile - and powerful. Her movement was fluid, drawing her blade and stepping in front of Star. She took a defensive posture, right hand making a few symbols in the air and a light blue glow encompassing her form as she reinforced her magical defenses. She would cast haste if a fight actually started, but due to how much it effected her body she wouldn't cast it until it was needed. Her basic defense spell though did not wear her body down like haste did, so no harm in placing it preemptively. If the short comment had come from anyone other than the man, she might have been amused by the antics. Ellesandra was short, especially for a guard and someone who spent a lot of their time training and learning to fight. You could put her in a servants outfit and she'd be able to fit in well enough simply because not many would see a 5'1 woman and thing 'oh she can fight', no matter how awkward she might be at whatever servants task she'd been given. In the training grounds, she fought to earn respect and eventually the jokes had turned from her being small and weak, to instead of ever poking fun at her directly they poked fun at her opponents for losing to a small girl. Which usually resulted in the joker getting punched in the arm with her middle finger out to give them a dead arm. That wasn't really an option here, nor was that the vibe that the two had. She met the man's eyes, having already cooled her panic into a caution and protective nature over Star. "I listened to the warnings. We're going to finish our mission, no matter your threats though."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Amelia and Amara looked at Ellesandra at the exchange went on. Star of course noticed the panic, and she dutifully fell in line near her protector, while also being prepared to do what she could in the fight. It looked like a fight was going to happen, at least. Though, this tall man just chuckled at the response. "Ahhh, so you're not deaf, you're just STUPID! I see, I see," he said, not really paying mind to the two crusaders. "Well. If THAT'S how it is, then might as well make sure you just die here, right? Shame you had to drag two other innocent people into it, but hey, what am I saying?" he said with an uproarious laugh, then fixed a piercing gaze upon Ellesandra as a smirk drew across his lips. "...You're all about letting innocent people around you die, isn't that right?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
To Amara, the Blood Emerald, and Amelia Ellesandra didn't react to that at all. Her face was stoic and she looked ready to fight, no flinching or movement or anything in response to it. To Star? The words met their target, but probably didn't get the reaction that he had wanted them to. He brought back that shame, that guilt that had been so heavy when she'd mentioned that someone had died for her previously. But that was well enough bottled up, pushed down enough, that it was quickly overtaken by a different emotion - fury. Fury, that he would use that against her. That he would try to throw Marigold's death in her face, to knock her off balance for a fight. To imply that Amelia and Amara would die just as she did in this, innocent and for her. The thing was, when a form of herself put her down by commenting on her shame, that was one thing. When someone she knew, trusted, looked up to, put her down for it - she took that and it truly effected her. When an opponent used it as a weapon? It might hit those feelings, that trauma and guilt inside her, but her fury at someone dropping that low to get to her far surpassed the guilt she felt in response to the comment. "Star, back up please." Her words came out even, controlled. Despite the fury, she was trained enough to not let it overtake her in a fight. It only had once, and she bore the scars for that - this gem wasn't good enough at goading her to make that happen again. Her eyes never left the gem's, ready to meet him in battle without a flinch in her demeanor.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked, seeing the reaction and then hearing the words. She didn't need to be told twice and backed up as requested. Amelia and Amara were still sizing up this opponent. He wasn't even armed. No weapons to speak of. The shadowy essence he possessed was potent. Far, far stronger than the pirate captain had. "Oh, shit. She told the prissy girl to back up. She means business now," said the man, raising his hands up in mock surrender. He didn't seem to be aggressive, which was keeping the other fighters in an uneasy stalemate, eyes occasionally darting around at their surroundings for any other threats. Was he just a distraction? "Wellllllll I could take care of your myself, short stack, but that'd just be...Boring. So what'cha think, Ellestupid? I've got three enemies I could send at you. Why don't you pick a number between one and three, hm? Make it fun. I'll even give you a hint! Number one is dark, number two is ugly, and number three is metal. Unless of course you wanna just take your shot at me now. I mean, you're gonna die anyway, horribly, and hopefully really slowly so like you can have all those regrets while you got blood leaking out of everywhere and it's really sad and shit, so you can always just try and...Stop me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't told Star to back up because she meant business, she just wanted to ensure Star was far enough away that the creature couldn't aim a strike at Ellesandra, Ellesandra dodge, and hit Star instead. No, she wanted Star to be out of the immediate fighting zone; it was also where Star would theoretically be the most useful, able to use whatever magics she had from a safe distance. The name, Ellestupid, was elementary. Again, if it had been anyone other than an enemy using it, she would have probably enjoyed the joke of an insult. There was one moment where Ellesandra took her eyes off the creature, looking around to ensure that none of those three enemies were around to attack Star immediately. The idea of attacking him went through her mind, but she remembered the words from Amara about not attacking someone needlessly. They didn't know the background to this, and if she just outright attacked someone who had done nothing but hurl insults at her that wouldn't be a good indication of their being able to play by those rules. So, Ellesandra stood there, weapon drawn and in a defensive posture, and made the decision not to play the man's game. She would stay silent, just watching him, letting him goad as he wished, attack, or send something else after them. She wanted to just fight him, but she didn't trust that wouldn't result in him sending those three creatures at Amara, Amelia, and Star instead. So, she remained defensive, ready to fight if necessary, and staring him down.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The silence lingered in the air for a time. He waited. Then, deciding Ellesandra wasn't playing his game, he shrugged. "Fine, fine, have it your way, they don't call you dumb for nothing I guess. I'll pick for you, since it was probably a really big assumption on my part that you could count in the first place. I know three is a really, really big number, but try not to hurt yourself thinking about it, all right? And say hello to you-know-who when you get to hell. 'Cause don't worry. I'm sure she's PISSED. Like, way beyond just slapping you and storming off kinda pissed. Like. Gonna tear you a new one so bad I am gonna be sad I won't be there to take notes kinda pissed." He then smirked. "Anyway, yeah. Die horribly. Ciao." He then saluted, spun on his heel, and walked away through a portal that opened for him to close behind him. He, and the shadowy presence, then vanished. Following that, a black lightning bolt struck in the place where he had been standing, and in the wake of the bolt was a suit of wrought-iron armor. The armor brandished a tall kite shield and a longsword, both made of wrought iron as well. All of the armor was charged with magic, and the gaps in the armor showcased a surging red mana. This armor did not contain any person. It was living armor. And it, unlike the man who departed, was armed, and began charging at the group of four. The immediate response came from Amelia, who threw her arm forward, cracking her whip in the air. The three fey creatures that floated in the air above them all responded by throwing bolts of various magic at the armor. A lightning bolt, fire bolt, frost bolt, wind bolt, and earthen bolt, each one a shot of magical energy that would strike down or even kill outright a regular human, each one hit true on the armor, but had no visible effect upon it. Amara looked at Ellesandra through her periphery. They had the opportunity to work together, and a duty to keep the lone enemy away from the backlines that had Amelia and Star. Whether Ellesandra took to their own lead, or deferred to Amara, they had precious few seconds to decide on a plan of action.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wanted to growl at the man. The comment about you know who wanting to slap her was mostly ignored; that wasn't Marigold's style. Oh she might be angry at Ellesandra for many reasons, but Ellesandra would never believe that Marigold blamed her for the result of what happened. Ellesandra blamed herself, and that's what Marigold would be upset at. It didn't make her blame herself any less, but oh well. Still, the fact that he just left? The coward wouldn't even face them himself. Yet, Ellesandra was immediately watching a large form of metal armor that began moving towards them, and didn't have time to curse the man who went back through the portal. She saw the magic lash out from Amelia, but she didn't look towards her. She considered using haste, but held off; if the man came back, or sent other creatures after them right after this one, using it so early in a fight that she wasn't sure would be over after this bout would be reckless. So, as she began moving, she began circling to the outside. Her eyes glanced towards Amara and met them, a light nod given, but she didn't spend much time making eye contact or anything. She wanted Amara to know Ellesandra was comfortable working as a team, but unless Amara gave her any orders to do otherwise, Ellesandra began circling around so that the armor would have to turn to face her, thus turning away from the others. That, or it continued to face the others and gave her a wide opening, but that was the less ideal of the two since it gave it the potential of stepping towards their spellcasters. Really, she wanted it's attention on her. Unfortunately, it seemed like a magical being, so taunting wouldn't work. She'd just have to be close enough to have it consider her a threat as she circled around, posture still defensive for now.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara saw the nod and watched Ellesandra, picking up on the plan immediately. She sped off to take the opposing flank to the armor, forcing it to have to fight on three sides. More bolts of magic hit the armor, but continued to hit with no visible effect. Amelia cursed under her breath, then held an arm up, recalling the essence of the three fey spirits back to her. She glowed faintly blue for a moment as the essence poured back into her, then she began to chant, eyes closed, as mana began to build around her. Amelia clearly had some plan, something that drew Amara's attention briefly. She called out to Ellesandra, believing the armor had no real way of caring about strategy, or at least that the strategy didn't require subtlety. "Just buy Amelia time! Don't take unnecessary risks!" ordered Amara, watching and waiting for how the fight would begin with the armor. The armor started by focusing on Ellesandra, taking swift steps towards the woman to attempt a horizontal slash across their chest. Unfortunately, the armor appeared to be languid in the moment and didn't even particularly come close to hitting her. What followed was then Amara coming from behind to seize on the opportunity. Her spear flourished expertly in one hand, caught with the other as she leapt into the air while loosing a valiant battlecry, the tip of her spear aglow with brilliant golden light as she SLAMMED it down onto the armor, which released a BOOM of magical force outwards. It wouldn't affect Ellesandra at all of course, it was just slightly loud. The effect, however, was the armor was knocked flat onto its front, with a noticeable chink in the back of the breastplate. Amara certainly hit hard, that was obvious, and one could be glad to count themselves as her ally and not her enemy. The armor performed a side swipe of its blade at Amara, but Amara had already hopped back, anticipating the counterattack. She was keeping to her own advice and not getting greedy just because she knocked the armor down. But of course, as it was rising up and thrust its sword behind itself, this opened a perfect opportunity for Ellesandra to get a quick strike in for free, perhaps more depending on how aggressive she elected to be.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was prepared for the swipe, but had expected it to actually come close. She was defensive after, waiting for a follow up and assuming that was a feint but...it just wasn't. It had fully missed her. More magic struck out while Amara slammed into it with her spear, Ellesandra glancing between them then also glancing towards Star to ensure she was still safe, since she hadn't seen anything from her yet. Assuming all was safe and well there, Ellesandra would take advantage of it swiping back at Amara, rushing in quickly and sending a wave of magic down the metal of her rapier with a few motions of her right hand. The penetrating strike, designed so that her rapier could pierce straight through a stone wall, was aimed right at one of the armor's joints in it's weapon arm. Oh, it was likely not human and going to react the same way, but she was going for at least damaging one of the weaker parts of the armor to make it's attacks slower. Whether or not that hit or did any major damage, she didn't press her advantage too much. She solidified herself as a potential threat, and quickly pushed back, creating enough distance she'd have room to dodge or move in the case of another attack coming her way, but still close enough she could strike if the creature decided to ignore her or look elsewhere.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star and Amelia were at a safe distance, that much seemed certain. Amelia kept chanting. Whatever they were doing, it seemed it was going to be powerful. But in the thick of the action, Ellesandra was given a free strike on the armor which allowed an easy shot on the weapon arm, which struck the red energy under the armor and cause it to warble and fizzle in response. The first actual sign of damage. A promising sign that was then met with the armor surging to a standing posture, fixed its gaze on Ellesandra, and this time kicked off from the dirt in a display of speed that was far above and beyond what it had previously showcased. But rather than its weapon, the armor, in one leap, flew towards Ellesandra with its shield held out before it that it used to slam into Ellesandra with a heavy shield bash. Ellesandra would find the attack unable to be dodged in time, though they had time enough to react with magic, or at least decide where the bash would hit them. And the force of the strike, if unmitigated, would carry force enough to crack the bone that bore the strike, easily sending Ellesandra off their feet regardless.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra hadn't expected the speed. She didn't wield a shield anymore, which previously is what she would use to deflect some of the blow. That not being an option, she adjusted her position so that the right side of her body was facing the shield. She kept her elbow down to block her ribs, used her forearm to come up to cover her head which she ducked into, and leaned into the blow to ensure the majority of the strike hit her arm - not her legs or waist or anything. In addition, the blue that had been covering her whole form all moved to focus on her singular right arm. Already injured, Ellesandra wasn't too concerned if it got more damaged; it would hurt, and it would suck, but it wouldn't exactly prevent her from fighting further. Still, the magic was used to prevent the force of the blow just obliterating her arm entirely. It was a good thing that the armor didn't follow up with another attack immediately, because Ellesandra MIGHT have underestimated just how much force would hit her. It did knock her off her feet with a crunch as it burst through the magical shield - which was designed to effect magical attacks more than physical attacks anyways, and certainly couldn't hold up against something like this - and hit her arm. She went flying backwards, pain rocketing her right arm as both her right humerus and ulna broke on impact. Her flight backwards was not one which she landed gracefully either, distracted by the pain and the slight ringing in her head at the force of the hit, she didn't get her feet under her in time to land upright. No, she hit the ground, surely bruising her left hip, and even did a single roll from the force of the blow before skidding in the dirt of the road and coming to a stop. "Fuck." Not exactly elegant, the words came out through clenched teeth as she used her left arm to stand. She'd had the presence of mind to hold her rapier out while falling to ensure she hadn't accidentally impaled herself on it, but as she stood she held her right arm close to her body, wincing. Even through the arm, she felt the bruises down the back right shoulder, and all of the old scars from before were screaming anew. She didn't try a counter attack at all, but instead turned her left side back towards the creature, holding up her rapier and preparing herself for a potential follow up attack, and hoping that Amelia was about finished with whatever she was doing.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The strike certainly showcased a heretofore depth to the danger that this animated suit of armor posed. The hit had Star surging with worry. She took a single step forward, then stopped herself. Her instinct, the one that tugged at her heart, to intervene was one that her more battle-acclimated mind, the one she knew Ellesandra would prefer she use, knew was a bad idea. She simply whimpered Ellesandra's name under her breath, holding back tears as she watched the knight get thrown to the ground. It was a fight. Ellesandra could handle it. She had to remind herself of this, and to think tactically. So rather than rush into the fight, she thought how she might be more useful instead. The armor was charging once finding its footing again, ready to follow up as Ellesandra was getting up. However, Star welled her mana and thrust an arm forward towards the fray. The ground between Ellesandra and the charging armor was her target, and her magic formed a green ball of energy in that space which then burst, coating the ground the knight was charging on with grease. A controlled patch, only a few feet across, that would land right underfoot for the knight, rather than coat half the street with it and make the fight messy for her allies as much as their enemy. The timing was tight, but the focus she maintained was peerless; she could not afford to fail Ellesandra in the moment. So it was that the grease appeared just as the armor's foot fell to the ground, then promptly skid out from under it to cause the armor to topple forward and fall prone, sliding a foot or two on the dirt once landing. As this was happening, Amara cursed under her breath, seeing the armor could be so unpredictable, and enveloped herself in mana to thrust across the battlefield with the magic of Misty Step, which saw her interceding between the armor and Ellesandra in defense just as the armor was landing on its face. As the armor was rising up again, Amara reared her spear back, the tip crackling with thunderous energy, then thrust it forward, seizing the chance as the armor was standing to hit it with a thunderous smite that sent it back again about ten feet and onto its back. Rather than push the offensive however, Amara called back, keeping her eyes forward. "Are you able to still fight, soldier?"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
It was a good thing Star had tripped the armored creature, as Ellesandra was almost certain she wouldn't have been able to dodge another blow that quickly. Having just stood, winded and with pain shooting through her right arm, she wouldn't have been able to cast haste quickly enough to use it's speed to get out of the way. She considered casting it now, as she watched Amara magically appear between her and the magical armor and attack it, but dismissed it. She needed to treat this fight as if it was the first of multiple, still not trusting the gem to only send one creature after them. The adrenaline of the fight and what needed to happen helped dull the pain, enough for her to raise her rapier again at the call. "Yes Ma'am." It had been years since she'd been called soldier and it felt...nice. She walked up to stand near Amara, rapier held forward with her left hand and her body tilted so that her injured, right arm was to the back. It was also held close to her body protectively, a combination of protecting the bruised ribs and also knowing any movement beyond keeping it close would cause pain to shoot through it. Old injuries were sore, though in reality that was more a psychological pain than physical. She only glanced towards Amara briefly before back to the creature that had been on it's back, poise loose so that she could easily start moving if it got up and started rushing again. She'd follow Amara's lead here, knowing that in her injured arm's form she would be a potential liability for Amara if she took the lead without going all out. And she still felt the need to hold back from doing that.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara nodded tightly. "Good. Then stay close, but to my flank and behind. We don't need to strike a killing blow, we just need to buy time. When I engage, move to stand between it and Amelia. She needs a bit more time, but she will ensure our victory with what I know she is summoning." Amara gave a quick look at Ellesandra to confirm understanding, then set off in a sprint that kept her spear in one hand, the shaft tight up against the back of her arm and shoulder while the tip was down, inches from the dirt, and vaguely in front of Ellesandra. A stance that allowed her to shield Ellesandra should the armor try to pick on the injured woman. The armor meanwhile had moved to stand again, then 'looked' at Amara and Ellesandra, then at Amelia and Star. It then raised its sword and began towards Amelia and Star. But with grit teeth, Amara shifted her posture to plant her feet firm and rear her posture back, spear in hand, to then hurl it at the armor. "You will face ME, demon!" she cried as she hurled her weapon, which struck true and landed square in the armor's leg, stopping its stride and pinning it in place. This was Ellesandra's opportunity to move to defend, if they chose to stick to the plan.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded her acknowledgment. She didn't like just putting her trust in whatever Amelia was summoning, but she wasn't in a state to argue either way. As Amara began moving forward to strike, Ellesandra kept pace with her. She ignored how each step sent a jarring pain up her right arm, the jostling of it not particularly pleasant, and let the thrill and adrenaline of a fight take over again. It wasn't exactly the type of fight, like the duel with herself in her dream, that one could truly relish since the essence of danger was there, but there was still that bit of joy Star might be able to sense, small beneath the focus, pain, caution and still fuming anger. As Amara hit the armored being, Ellesandra took the opportunity given to move and stand between it and the two spellcasters again. With it's attention briefly moved over to Amara again, Ellesandra tossed her Rapier in the air and quickly made the necessary magical runic signs with her left hand this time, the blue defensive light coming back into place around her again and catching the rapier as it fell back into place. It wasn't as clean as it really should have been, but she hadn't practiced doing that in a long time. Previously she could toss her weapon up, cast, and catch it smoothly and gracefully; it was how she'd practiced it while she still wielded a shield. It hadn't been necessary since she'd started using her right hand for it, not being able to wield a shield on it easily anymore, so as it fell the rapier tipped forward and she had to correct her stance. Ellesandra didn't attack, taking up her guard posture and stepping close enough to create the sense of threat if the creature turned back towards the mages, but instead taking up a defensive posture planned for avoiding a blow and counterattacking if she became the target, or being able to strike a quick blow if it decided to try to step past her towards the mages.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The armor had been stuck for just a moment as the spear impaled through its red 'body' in a gap between the armor. A few tugs had it breaking free, however, and it resumed its advance as Amara caught up to pull her spear free from the dirt. Of course, Ellesandra was in the way now, so the armor began to advance to engage her, only to be once more struck with an empowered strike from Amara from behind, causing the armor to stumble slightly. "I said you face ME!" barked Amara, though whether this was actually to goad the armor or just hype herself up wasn't clear. Amara blossomed with a fearlessness to her that truly befit her rank. The conviction in her eyes was unwavering. Her spirit, unbreakable. Being repeatedly beat up from the enemy the armor was NOT facing seemed to evoke some measure of annoyance as its red 'body' under the armor flashed. It then turned and engaged Amara, just as the captain wanted. Blows traded back and forth. "Ellesandra! Are you okay?" asked Star, keeping her distance but feeling it was a moment she could call out without unduly distracting the knight. Amara and the armor meanwhile had blade meet spear repeatedly, the clang of metal on metal reverberating out with each strike as Amara's footwork kept her at the ideal distance to fight with her spear while keeping her out of range of the armor's longsword so that when thrusts and swipes did break past her ability to deflect with her spear, she had enough room to just slightly shift back in her stance and avoid the strike. She showcased a refinement to her technique as she intercepted strikes, parried, and capitalized on the few openings she was afforded with lightning reflex. But even with a clear earned experience with her craft, the armor surged with magic once more and attempted to do to Amara what it had done to Ellesandra. A sudden flash of red, a burst of speed, and it shot forward at the captain with its shield beared. Amara, having seen the attack on Ellesandra, braced for the hit with a sudden burst of golden light surrounding her, and a loud gong of magical sound as three golden magical shields shot out around her for a split second. Knowledge of divine magic would reveal this to be Shield of Faith, which while it would not save her from the impact, would lessen the blow. Still, just as Ellesandra was hit, so was Amara. But between her magic and knowing what to expect, she was able to throw her shoulder into a body-check at the enemy just before they closed the distance, striking back while also preventing the armor from adding the force of the shield swing to the hit. Despite being prepared, Amara was still sent flying back just the same with a wince of pain clear on her face as she flew back into the wall of the ruins behind her. Her back slammed against the stone wall, cracking it and certainly doing its damage to Amara in the process. A breathless cry came from her as she readied to continue the fight, but the armor was already upon her, floating off the ground this time in anticipation of another attempt to intercept its charge. With Amara pinned and dazed against the wall, it thrust its sword forward, striking straight through Amara's abdomen. Straight through her and, indeed the wall behind, Amara could only cry out in pain as she was struck. Not defeated yet however, Amara's eyes burned with divine fire and she thrust the handle of her spear, held between both hands diagonally across her, at the armor with a thunderous boom of divine energy. The armor was sent stumbling back, its sword still lodged in Amara's abdomen and pinning her to the wall. She looked poised to keep fighting despite her wound, fighting through a truly grievous wound, still impaled. She wasn't calling for help. And though she had no real authority over Ellesandra, the lack of new orders suggested she wanted Ellesandra to stick to the plan. But was that just blind heroism, or was Amara truly just made so tough that she could keep fighting such a lethal opponent in such a state?
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra watched as the armor turned to fight against Amara. Amara was clearly skilled, but there was an unease as she continued watching. Even if Amara was good, Ellesandra hated just standing to the side, guarding and waiting. She knew she was injured, so it was the right thing to do; strategically, it made sense, which is why she didn't rush in to join Amara's fight and back her up. She hardly heard Star shout, a muttered - "Fine" coming out dismissively. It was obvious she wasn't fine, Star would easily be able to see the pain radiating in her aura, but the fine wasn't even intended to be a lie. Was she tip top shape? No, but that would be obvious to a child. She was fine to keep fighting, and in that Ellesandra was telling the full truth. She focused on the armor while Amara fought, trying to see if she could find a weak spot like the pirate had. There wasn't one, but it was obvious that the magic was the red...stuff inside that was controlling the armor, not the armor itself. That wasn't a surprise, but the fact that she could feel the shadow in it made her consider. That thought was immediately interrupted by the sight of Amara getting slammed into the wall, and then followed up by getting impaled. Ellesandra's response was immediate. "Star, put the grease behind me, between you two and the armor." It would effectively cut the battlefield in half. While it wouldn't be impossible for the armor to get past it, it would at least slow it down and ensure that Ellesandra would be able to catch back up with it if it suddenly changed it's target. Star, if she were paying enough attention, would see a flash of that guilt that she'd seen before, when Ellesandra had broken down in the Elven settlement, but it was quickly masked as Ellesandra focused herself on the battle. Amara may not be calling for her, but she was obviously not in a situation to fight against it, pinned to the wall and impaled as she was. She started with switching her rapier to her right hand as she moved forward. It was painful gripping onto it, but her focus was entirely on her plan of action next. She was trying to use the armor's focus on Amara against it and close the distance quickly enough that it couldn't react. Her left hand made the signs for her haste spell, hoping to only have to use it for a few moments, but at this point it was better than waiting for something that didn't seem to be coming from Amelia while Amara bled out. Ellesandra didn't know Amelia, and she was willing to trust Amara but the situation had changed, so Ellesandra was no longer going for the 'wait for Amelia to finish her spell' plan. As she closed in, her speed having picked up as the golden shimmering light took over her body, she pulled out her dagger with her left hand and aimed at the spot in the armor that Amara had already pierced with her spear. She aimed to strike hard through the armor into the red mana within, but she also didn't plan on pulling her hand back if she succeeded. If she did, she planned on using her power to begin absorbing the red mana, at least as much as she could before she would inevitably be thrown off or away from it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star obviously wasn't expecting Ellesandra to actually be fine fine. Fighting shape fine was good enough for now. A little reassurance that Ellesandra was still in the fight. She gave a tentative nod to that. It was more of an emotional response than a logical one. But more reassuring than hearing Ellesandra say fine was that they were involving her in a plan. She nodded. "Right!" It felt good. She was being involved. Had a purpose. Was able to do more than just stand by helpless as others fought for her. When Ellesandra took off, she did as asked and created a streak of grease that would keep the armor from walking over it without risk of slipping and falling. It had shown it could float, but hopefully that was a limited ability. Regardless, Star watched closely, looking for any other opportunity to help. Ellesandra found the opportunity was present for them. The armor had no weapon as that was still impaling Amara, so even if it had managed to turn and face Ellesandra, it wouldn't have much to do besides try and interpose its shield. It was fixed on Amara, however, so Ellesandra's blade struck true, causing more disturbance in the red essence. Their ability to then absorb the mana, however, proved to destabilize it more significantly and was looking as it would be an effective method of dealing with them. That was until the mana proved to be more than just raw mana, however. It was...Tainted. Almost immediately, Ellesandra felt it. The weight crashing onto their mind. The darkness crawling into it. Their mind's resilience was able to keep it at bay initially, but the waves of pounding darkness were, after a valiant attempt to resist, too strong and eventually broke Ellesandra's resistance. The darkness enveloped Ellesandra's mind, making the world around them fade. Ellesandra was suddenly in the body of another woman who was being struck by an abusive lover through tear stained eyes as the burly man shouted at her for some failure that was inaudible, muffled behind the sound of her own tears. For the moment, Ellesandra WAS this woman, experiencing life through their eyes and feeling the burning of bruises on her face as tears rolled down her cheeks. A minute later, she was in the body of a man who was crawling on the ground, the pounding pain of an arrow in his spine surging through Ellesandra as if it were her own; she would not be able to feel her legs in this existence, and could only crawl with bloody palms along before the sting of a blade entered into her throat and she experienced death itself embrace her. And from there, another woman's life as she watched her own child being dragged away by a gang of slavers who held her at the point of a blade, one of the other masked slavers grinning wide as he undid his belt buckle and eyed the woman menacingly. Then into another body of a man whose every breath wheezed as he lay in bed, feverish to the point of hallucinating and knocking on death's door from the pestilence that was overtaking him. Then into another, a man weeping as an executioner fitted a noose around his neck while he stood upon a platform before an audience of people who threw whatever they had at him. A crime he did not commit, he knew this well, yet he would hang for it; his own wife and son stood among the crowd, looking at him with disgust. His mind screamed he was framed again and again and again, but it was a plea that had been heard by none. He did not want to die, and yet he knew this hour was his last. These visions pounded against Ellesandra's mind again and again and again as the mana burned in Ellesandra's veins. Its influence waned as the mana was consumed, dissipating out of Ellesandra slowly, but steadily. When Ellesandra woke again, she found herself prone on the ground, dagger a handful of feet from her body, and a pounding, painful ringing in her head, along with blood trickling down from her forehead. Nothing was broken there, but the firm back of an elbow had met her forehead to knock her down. The influence wasn't completely gone, but it was steadily still leaving Ellesandra as conscious returned to them. Until it fully left her though, flashes of fear, of these terrified emotions of other people who Ellesandra would know intrinsically were real people. No amount of mental conditioning or pushing the emotions down would suffice. The feeling was overwhelming, having shattered Ellesandra's resistance. It felt like minutes had passed, but in truth, only a dozen seconds or so had passed that encompassed Ellesandra's brief blackout. The armor again moved towards Amara after having knocked Ellesandra away.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had expected the absorption to be odd, since it was controlling a piece of armor, but she had not expected the darkness of it, or how it would effect her mind. She'd gasped as it crashed into her mind, the darkness crawling in. She did her best to resist, but it had hit her in surprise and the effort was futile. The world faded and she felt the pain, the fear, the betrayal of someone being abused. The absolute fear that came with that, the bruised and pained face, the sobbing, choking tears. The yelling was background - she couldn't tell what was being said, exactly, but was overwhelmed with the feeling that the yelling gave her. The anxiety, the complete lack of self-worth that the yelling instilled in her, that she'd done something wrong. That she'd messed up, despite it being the abusive man who was at fault; in the moment, like any DA victim, Ellesandra couldn't tell that. She was then shifted into the body of a man, pain shooting through her back. There was confusion as to what was happening in the back of her mind, but it was too far distant to the actual experience happening to recognize. Each new memory added to the last, until finally she gasped back into the 'real' world, laying on the ground. Her feelings were in complete disarray, having been completely unable to process like she normally would have during those visions, if that's even what you could call them. The fear, pain, sorrow, dread - all of them blurred her vision for a moment and between that and the apparent fact that she was laying on the ground now took her a moment to recenter herself and realize what happened. When she did, staring at the armor making it's way to Amara again, she groaned and moved to stand up. During the experience of the visions her concentration on the haste spell had ended, unable to maintain concentration on a spell when her mind was such focused on different experiences. Luckily, it had only been briefly used, so the lethargy her muscles felt were relatively minimal; more as if she had just been fighting hard for an additional five minutes or so, versus how absolutely exhausted she'd been after fighting the pirate. Pain shot through her right arm as she moved to stand and she focused on that, using it to keep her mind focused on the current situation. She needed to get to the creature before it got to Amara again. She didn't know what to expect from this, but fighting it now when it didn't have it's weapon - and before it got back to put a finishing blow on Amara. Hoping it would either not see her, or turn around and face her entirely rather than focusing on Amara, she stepped forward to strike through it's wounded armor again, except this time she just reached in with her left hand instead of a weapon. Her hand closed inside, attempting to just grip the visible red energy if she could. She didn't know if she could, but either way she did the same thing as last time. She worked to absorb the energy, but ripped her arm back out at the same time, planning to rip the energy out rather than fully absorbing all of it. Even if she did absorb some, she would work to fight off these visions, and keep doing it. Surely, this had to be harming or slowing it down, right?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara wasn't going to just let the armor come kill her, naturally. As Ellesandra was working up to their feet again, Amara reached down to the blade in her abdomen, grabbed it by the hilt, and cried out in pain as she tore the blade out of her, spraying her own blood on the battlefield before her. She threw the sword far and away from the armor, keeping it well out of reach from it. She then swelled her mana inside herself and slammed her other hand against her wound as it began to shine with bright white light. She groaned, but the magic of her Lay on Hands burned into her body and closed the wound, repairing what was broken in her body, leaving not even a scar in its wake. It might have taken all the magic she had left, but she wasn't out of the fight yet. She picked up the spear and moved to meet the armor just as Ellesandra was reaching in to grab more of the mana. Grabbing and throwing it wasn't really proving possible, though Ellesandra did succeed in absorbing more of the mana. And in doing so, another wave of visions much like the first struck Ellesandra, leaving them briefly paralyzed in place. This time, Amara was engaging the armor, however, so Ellesandra was just stuck in a daze as they moved through another half dozen people who suffered, who died, who cried, who were broken by fear and the worst moments of humanity played out before her eyes and forced her to live through them. The briefer contact left these memories too brief and too disordered to remember details; the fear, the suffering, was all that Ellesandra would remember. When Ellesandra woke again, Amara was keeping the armor threatened. But before she could engage in earnest, it seemed Amelia was finally done. She called out: "I CALL OUT TO YOU; HEED MY SUMMON AND OBLITERATE MY ENEMY! I CALL TO THEE, ADAMANTINE DRAGON: VAERIX!" she called out, her voice resonating with booming mana. She then rose her arms straight up. A swell of mana burst out from behind her, the very ground below all of them shaking as a blue, ethereal, semi-transparent summon of a massive dragon; as it rose up from the ground, the blue tint was slowly lost until the dragon took its natural colours and full opaque colouring, revealing it to be coating it shimmering silver scales that were, if its name was to be taken at face value, were made of adamantine. Vaerix snarled as it fully emerged, stepping past Amelia and fixing its silvery, draconic eyes on the evil armor; its fangs were shimmering of the same metal as its scales. Amara stepped back; the armor looked up at the dragon just as one massive claw descended onto the armor, flattening it under the force of its stomp down onto it. The dragon curled its claws around the armor, picking it up, then threw the armor down the street of the ruined city, sending the armor careening away to bounce and flail against the ground as it skipped across the dirt with repeated impacts, rolling and tossing and getting dented along the way until it eventually came to a sliding stop face down. Vaerix then slowly sauntered forward, its imposing wings folded neatly against its back. It took up the entire street with its stride, but naturally stepped over Ellesandra and Amara as it walked past. The armor rose up and grabbed is weapon as it sprinted towards the dragon and made an enthusiastic thrust against one of the dragon's legs. The sword attempted to bite into the scales of the armor, only to...Harmlessly bounce of with a metal *ting*. Vaerix looked down at the armor, unimpressed, then rose up the other arm, balled its talons into a fist, and began to POUND upon the armor again, and again, and again, and again, shaking the ground with each powerful thrust that further pounded the armor into a crater in the ground. The armor clearly had a massive tenacity to withstand stuch strikes, but Amara seemed fine to relax a little and start catching her breath as she wiped sweat from her brow. The armor winning against Vaerix seemed...Exceptionally implausible, after all. But even as she was relaxing and moving back towards Amelia and Star, stepping around the patch of grease, she kept an eye on things, just in case the armor got past the dragon. Her guard was still up, but she seemed confident they had now won. Star similarly wasn't about to preemptively celebrate, though she was looking at Ellesandra with...Exceptional concern.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a little surprised by the sight of Amara just ripping the weapon out from her chest and then healing it. She shouldn't have been, considering the other magical things Amara had done, but still. The failed attempt to rip the mana out of the armor was unfortunate, especially as it left her dazed afterwards. She'd thought she'd prepared herself for it, but the feelings were still there from last time. Her mental guard wasn't up, still reeling from the previous lives she'd just lived, and suddenly she was back in them - experiencing trauma over and over through different eyes. These experiences really, really did not help her with the whole 'oh processing emotions is a positive experience' thing Star was trying to send to her. The thing was, as she lived these lives, she didn't have the ability to take the trauma and repress it like she did with her own; she had to LIVE it. So it was no wonder that Star would be looking at her with concern. Ellesandra, who typically repressed any negative - and some positive - emotions that began to creep up, was cycling through terror, dread, pain, horror, more pain, absolute devastation and depression, all in the matter of moments. Even as she came out of it, this time she wasn't in a position to get back up. She dropped to a knee and gasped, head down and tears streaming down her face. The sound of the dragon being summoned, how it just stepped past her, how Amara began walking back, all of it was white noise. The visions had sent emotions spiraling through Ellesandra that she couldn't just bottle up. Even if she had the presence of mind during each vision to try, there was only so much the bottle could hold and it was already full of Ellesandra's own trauma. So it was here, that she looked defeated. She was a mirror of the defeated version of herself on that card, head bowed, right arm broken and hanging limply to her side, on her knees with her head hung low, bent over with only her left arm holding her up from the ground. Through the fight, strands of her silver white hair had come out of it's ponytail - mostly because of how she'd been tossed - and fell down around her cheek messily, sticking to it as soon as the hair touched her damp face. Her shoulders shook and, unable to either process the feelings and trauma she'd seen, or repress like she normally did, she just sobbed. It was a different sobbing than when Star had last seen her do it, though. This wasn't the personal pain, grief, and guilt that came up before. This was an overwhelmed, unable to process any of the emotions that she'd felt, just pure depression wracking her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was swift to move to Ellesandra's side once she was confident the danger had passed. The pounding of draconic fist against the armor continued, having driven the armor into a three foot crater at this point as life finally stared to seep out of the red mana among the now pancaked pieces of metal. The dragon finished it by rearing its head back, then diving it forward and spewing white flames down onto the armor that spread outwards from the point of impact, glassing the dirt and leaving the armor nothing but a pile of molten wrought iron. The dragon then huffed through its nose, spewing smokey puffs from its nostrils, and moved back to its master, Amelia. Star was at Ellesandra's side at this point as the dragon stepped over them again. She felt she didn't really have room to ask permission this time. Her hands landed on Ellesandra and immediately flooded Ellesandra with the magic of her aura. Where the armor's negative energies poisoned Ellesandra's mind, her mana was a potent healing salve. She closed her eyes, focusing on the energies she felt. She measured her breathing, keeping herself steady as she was exposed to such potent pains. But with her influence, Ellesandra would feel for the first time what happened when Star was actively TRYING to use her powers to affect emotion. It was the same effect that had quashed Ellesandra's nightmares; her presence, her magic, it did not erase the emotion that Ellesandra felt, but it did suffuse the knight with calm. With serenity. Inner peace. The visceral bite of fear, of terror, washed away, replaced by a deep warmth in Ellesandra's heart that whispered tenderly: 'You are safe'. It could not remove the memory of the things Ellesandra felt, but it was able to sever the connection of those emotions from Ellesandra's heart, restoring their own emotion to themselves and allowing their heart to compartmentalize and recognize that these other emotions were not their own. Recognize the outside influence, and restore a sense of self. Star's magic was a direct counter to whatever burned itself into Ellesandra's heart and mind, and the shadowy essence that clung to Ellesandra saw itself purged by the light of her aura resonating with Ellesandra's. One could almost imagine the smirk on the face of the Blood Emerald as Ellesandra suffered under that magic...And just as easily might imagine how quickly it would be taken away as Star so skillfully expunged it and allowed Ellesandra to return to calm. And of course, while Star was there, she was sure to fix Ellesandra's arm, repairing the bones and the bruising, which took far more healing energy than it ought to because of Ellesandra's double-edged ability. Star could already hear her companion advocating for a day, maybe two, maybe a week of rest for Star for daring to put her power to use in healing them. It was just a little nosebleed...
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was in no position to resist Star's touch, or her healing. Even as Star worked, breaking up the connection these felt emotions had on her own, helping soothe and calm, Ellesandra didn't stop sobbing. Her arm was healed, and there was a twinge of annoyance at that way in the back of Ellesandra's mind, but it wasn't anything active or present enough to matter right now. All it changed was how she moved to sit up fully on her knees, raising her hands up to her face and covering it as her shoulders jerked. Star may have separated the emotion felt in the visions from Ellesandra, but once she was sobbing she couldn't just....stop. It was like trying to contain a waterfall, the memory of the man yelling, the arrow hitting her in the back, the desperation at being hanged while innocent, the other deaths and betrayals, sadness and fear. What it did help with, though, was finally being able to push the memories and the feelings that were her own, in response to the memories, back. To slowly begin to gain thought and control again. The desire to seek out comfort, to turn to Star and bury her face in Star's shirt was there, but she didn't. She sat there eyes closed, as the sobs slowly subsided and she was able to wipe away her tear stained cheeks. The summoned dragon had already returned, and as she began to take in the surroundings again, all she could thing was 'well that was overkill'. She couldn't help but feel a little irritation at Amelia; couldn't she have summoned something a little weaker, but faster? The memory of Amara being impaled sent a wave of panic through her though, eyes quickly scanning the area to find Amara, properly healed back up, and then finally back up to Star, noticing the nosebleed. It was only then she remembered that her arm had been healed, and she was moving it around again. "Idiot." She muttered, but there was...affection in the comment. It wasn't meant as an insult, not directly. A minor slap on the wrist type of comment, but also one that wasn't said in any malice. There was appreciation that Star hadn't taken the pain on herself but had used mundane magic to heal her, even if it hadn't been the smartest thing to do at the time in Ellesandra's eyes.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star didn't need Ellesandra to initiate the comfort. She slid her arms around the woman, holding them as best she could with their armor on, to give that comfort. A hand cradled their head and sweet nothings were whispered to them. She continued to pour her influence into the woman, helping them come back to center themselves. Her powers did not control Ellesandra's emotions, but she did have power to guide them back to center, to pour in comfort by the bucket. She knew how to address the worst pains and fears by dousing them with deep-seated warmth that reassured to the contrary. She wasn't in danger. She wasn't being abused. She wasn't being hanged. She wasn't dying. She was okay. Everything was okay. That is what Star's influence reinforced, over and over and over, until emotional stability and peace returned. She didn't lose any of her concern even after enough emotional stability had returned that Ellesandra could stop the tears, however. And being called an idiot in that playfully chiding way just had her smiling. "Idiot, huh? Don't think I can't put together what happened. Trying to absorb the enemy's energy disabled you and then you just go and do it again?" she asked, still smiling as some tears formed in the corner of her eyes. She knew Ellesandra was just fighting however she could figure out how, and to try and save Amara. Truly, she found Ellesandra's tenacity and grit in the moment to be heroic, but she'd dare not say that word around them after last time. The dragon was still summoned, keeping watch over the four adventurers. Vaerix dipped its snout down to brush up against Amelia, who giggled and put a hand under the dragon's chin. "Hey, handsome," she said with affection to the dragon. Amara was holding the spot she was impaled, blood had stained the skin but it didn't seem to be actively bleeding. If the blood was wiped away, there would be no wound to be found, though it was still a bit sore, clearly. Amara certainly was calm, not looking like someone nursing an impalement wound. Amara just surveyed the battlefield, keeping an eye on Ellesandra and Star but allowing them their privacy while scanning for other threats.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra snorted at the comment about her going to absorb the energy again. "Not my smartest idea." She mumbled, her throat sore and raspy from the sobbing. She reached up and once again wiped at her face, having for once not resisted Star's comforting touch when she'd offered it, but as she stabilized more and came back to herself, she slowly moved to stand and pull away from her. There was a hint of shame that crept up, realizing she'd stopped mid-fight to just break down and cry. It had been lucky that Amara had survived that, considering. She remembered what she had told the defeated version of herself, that she would never just lay her weapon down in a fight, yet here Ellesandra was and she had just stopped fighting after seeing those visions, just collapsed to her knees. Shame and guilt swirled, along with anger coming up at herself. "Stupid." She added on, though this time when she was talking about herself, it didn't have the affectionate and joking tone. It was serious, upset that she'd not only put herself in such a position, but risked Amara's well being as part of it. Fully standing, she did a quick look down herself - her weapons laying around her, and the way her armor on her right arm was all scuffed and dented. It would require some work tonight to fix, but it had done it's job of not having her arm be completely shattered at least. A glance was given around, searching for any hints of that shadow again or to see if the Blood Emerald came back at all. "Is...everyone okay?" She whispered this to Star, not feeling comfortable actually asking Amara after the display she'd just put on for them.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wore a small smile. "No, but...Points for trying," she said as she stood up with Ellesandra, helping them by grabbing their rapier and handing it to them while leaving them to retrieve their dagger. Vaerix and Amelia were idly bonding as master and pet might do; one might notice that Amelia used a far more affectionate and sweet tone with her dragon than she had with Ellesandra or Star. A soft side under that harder exterior, perhaps. Star looked at Amelia and Amara, then nodded to Ellesandra, then took it a step further and walked closer to the group to address Amara. She gently bowed to them. "Thank you, Amara. Please, if you need any further healing, let me help," she offered, earning a soft smile from Amara, who seemed to pick up on Star's gentle nature. Amara shook her head. "I might be tapped out for the day, but I'm fine. A shower and bed are what I need now." She then looked over at Ellesandra. "You two can thank me by explaining just what in the nine hells that was about. That asshole of a man obviously knew you, Ellesandra. And while I sincerely doubt you invited him over for a tea party with the rest of us, I can't imagine he's happy about us breaking his toy, and that that might not be the last we see of him once he learns he didn't get what he wanted, which seemed to be stopping you from coming with us."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wanted to roll her eyes, but she didn't want to respond so evidently to Star. Points for trying meant nothing in a fight; it meant you failed, and that could cause you to die. It didn't here, but the self criticism was valid whether or not she got some arbitrary 'points'. She grabbed her dagger and took the rapier from Star as offered, sheathing them both then moving with Star up towards Amara, Amelia, and the imposing dragon. Ellesandra spent a moment eyeing the dragon, both curiously and cautiously. She had no expectation of being able to win in a fight against it, but that didn't stop her from immediately considering how she would go about fighting it if Amelia turned on them for some reason. A habit built out of needing to be prepared for any scenario. Still, when Amara spoke to her, Ellesandra turned her eyes from the dragon over to her. There was hesitation in Ellesandra's response, looking around unsure if anyone would be listening in, and then also at Star. Star had only shared that she was looking to return to her home plane, not to find or save her mother, and that bit of information wasn't Ellesandra's to share. So, she would limit the way she explained it. "Well - he serves someone who goes by the name Black Diamond, and who is responsible for both the reason Star was sent away from home originally, at least I believe so, and resisting her attempting to come back home. For some reason they don't seem capable or willing to communicate to her directly or try to interfere directly with her, so they've chosen to do so with those who have agreed to guard her in the meantime. Her previous bodyguard also received dreams and visions from them, but not Star. I will say, I've been told that they will not be able to bother us while we are in Myst, though. I suspect that is due to the magical block you indicated previously, though once we get to her home realm I'm sure they will be waiting again to ambush or attack us there." Specific, but also pretty vague with a lot of gaps. That would cover the question though, right? And reassure Amara that Myst would be safe.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara listened to the explanation with a few nods. Amelia also paid close attention. Vaerix had noticed Ellesandra eyeing them, but to Vaerix, Ellesandra was about as dangerous as an ant, and there was no reason for them to focus too much on Ellesandra unless Ellesandra threatened Amelia. As they all were clearly allies, Vaerix was content to lay themselves down and coil their tail so that their massive body took up three-quarters of the ruined square in which they stood. A safer place there wasn't likely to be. "What kinda name is that?" asked Amelia rhetorically. "Kinda stupid," she added, folding her arms. Amara smirked at Amelia's attitude, but didn't respond to it. "Aye, something like that. Gods of any sort cannot reach Myst, either as avatars or with their extraplanar interference. The only exception being that magic users whose influence comes from such beings isn't severed, just dampened. That is, paladins, clerics, warlocks, can still commune with such beings, but that influence to those gods or patrons just seems to be coming from nowhere. Myst is sequestered away from the influence of everything except the people who inhabit it. So whomever is trying to communicate with or threaten you will have no luck while you're in Myst. And I dare them to try and come chase you - the dampening field will make them easy prey if they prove to be so stupid." Amara put her spear on her back again, believing that things were finally safe again. Amelia then spoke up, arms folded: "So what makes Star so special, huh?" she asked, looking at Star. "Obviously doesn't seem like they mind killing her, so what's the deal? The explanation leaves a lot of holes as to the 'why' of it all. And that armor was full of an absolute fuckload of mana, so whoever CREATED that thing obviously would need to have a hell of a lot more themselves. Not that I'm complaining about being alive or anything, but it's really not adding up to me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was a little amused at Amelia's comment about his name. "Agreed, I chose to call him Die." She didn't add anything about Sapphire - in fact, had she said much about Sapphire to Star? She knew she'd mentioned the name when she shared that her mother was alive, but she hadn't expanded much more beyond that. As Amara continued to comment on the magic and deities and asking more questions, Ellesandra took a deep breath. "They first tried to encourage me not to agree to be her guard and honestly is the main reason I accepted the contract." That was partially news to Star, so Ellesandra looked directly at Amara as she spoke instead of at Star. "They indicated that Star would die on her journey if I stayed with her because she would feel empowered to continue her journey and she would die if she did. Yet if I didn't, she would give up and thus not die." There was a brief pause, and then she added. "Which if you've met Star is wrong. But the reason of the return I leave up to Star to tell, it's not my story to share." And with that, she would turn to look at Star. She wasn't about to share information about her mother without permission, no matter how open Star seemed to be about her emotions and things.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amelia quirked a brow at the nickname. She found that a dumb nickname to pick, but she didn't say it. Amara didn't hold any judgement as she listened. Star, meanwhile, frowned and knit her brow at some point when Ellesandra was talking. Something seemed to bother her about what Ellesandra said. Not offend per se, but...Sting a little. Star spoke up when it was her turn. "I'm what's known as an Auramancer. It's a rare kind of magic. So rare that I've never been able to find anything substantial written about it anywhere, nor know anyone who knows anything about it, other than my mom of course, who is also one like me." She spoke of Aurora in present terms, now that she knew her mother was alive. Amelia looked dumbfounded by this mention of rare magic. Indeed, it was the look that confirmed she'd never heard of it. Amara looked intrigued, and examined Amelia's response as well. "...Well then. As it happens, Myst is also a repository of information. The central structure in Myst is known as the Athenaeum. It has the greatest collection of knowledge in all the multiverse, secured over the past thousand years by the Followers of Myst, like myself and Amelia. If there is anywhere that has information about your magic, it is there. And if it does not? Well...The Followers would greatly appreciate time to ask you questions and study your magic, if you'd allow us." An offer that gave Star pause. Some mild discomfort showed on her face. "I-I'd...Have to think on that."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't notice that Star felt upset about something, having not looked at her most of that. When she did look over, she watched Star explain that they were looking for her mom who knew about Auramancers, but not any information about her mother being captured by Black Diamond. It made her glad she hadn't revealed anything about it. It seemed Amara offered knowledge though about it, which would probably be interesting to Star if they got back from saving her mother. Right now though, she wasn't sure and the discomfort at being asked about her magic was obvious. Ellesandra took a step closer to Star, a protective action that was completely unconscious, but she didn't add anything else herself. This was Star's journey, just her guarding Star; all Ellesandra did was keep an extra eye out now, on alert.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara didn't take offense to Star's hesitation. A calm, motherly smile came upon her. She rose one hand. "Please, don't feel pressured. But do know that the Followers would consider it a great service. That all said, if you are both ready, I believe we should away to Myst properly before anything else decides to come attack us," said Amara, looking to Star and Ellesandra for confirmation. There were a few things to settle on the matter, like how much gold to take out, which was something that had Star looking with some measure of uncertainty at Ellesandra to help her figure out.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra glanced over to Star and then, after another wary glance over at the two Myst natives and the dragon, she turned entirely to Star. "Perhaps we can get what we'd normally spend in a month's time for room and board, times two? I don't know how much we will need, but that should be plenty enough to cover it without us getting everything out. And anything else that you feel like you would like. We can add it to my pack or get you a pack while we're in town to add." Since Star had just been using her magical storage she knew she would need a pack of her own, but it could be a small pack so Star didn't have to carry too much. Ellesandra probably wouldn't let her, if Star didn't insist on it.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star considered the notion for a moment. She truly didn't expect there to be much worry about being thievery, but she couldn't deny her companion's desire for caution. So she summoned the coinpurse and her bedroll, the bedroll going to Ellesandra to put on their pack as they had mentioned it would, with the coinpurse also being handed to them. "If someone's going to try and take it, they're more likely to think twice if they have to go through you to get it," she said with a light smile, though something still seemed to be bothering her behind that smile. The simple bag of coins with its leather strap to pull it closed had fifteen platinum in it. A hundred and fifty gold. If the prices in Myst were higher than standard, it would cover their costs. If the prices were standard, it would give them a little extra wiggle room for the month, assuming they pulled in no money from work or other means. Amelia felt the need to chime in: "You ought to just get a Bag of Holding while you're in the city. There's only like a hundred bazillion of them on the markets."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She would take her pack around to strap the bedroll to it properly, and then with the bag of coins would tuck it and strap it against the dagger sheathe beneath her armored skirt. A glance was given to Amara at the mention of using a bag of holding and she would shrug, leaving that up to Star. It was Star's money, after all, and Ellesandra didn't find a need for such a magic item for most of her journeys. She'd noticed the light smile seemed odd, but Ellesandra did not have the empathy and insight to be able to easily identify something was off. Instead, she got everything set up on the pack and slung it back over her left shoulder, looking between Star and Amara. "I think we're ready then. I must share that magical effects don't effect me well, so if this is any form of travel that is not a simple portal or something to this realm, you may find it more difficult." Ellesandra had never been successfully teleported somewhere before, though she had used a portal before.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I think we're all fine to keep standard with portals," said Amara, then looked to Amelia. Amelia moved over to Vaerix and moved to touch her forehead to Vaerix's snout. "I'll call on you again when I need you, Vaerix. Go be free again," she said, and with those words, the dragon began to shimmer blue and slowly fade away into sparkling lights that flicked out of existence again. A slow process, one that Amelia had a little faint bittersweet smile about her while letting the dragon return to wherever it was going. The bond Amelia had with her summons seemed to be quite strong. She did still have the two floating orbs about her, which squeaked some sort of utterance that was unintelligible to all but Amelia. Amelia then sighed and pushed her hand slowly forward. Four magical lights shot out from her palm, forming the four corners of a rectangular portal that then flooded with magic to create a swirling blue mist that had runes floating about in the magical storm. Amelia looked behind her at the other three and nudged her head. Amara followed, looking once over her shoulder to ensure the others were following. Star took in a deep breath, then joined along with the others after nodding to Ellesandra. When the group passed through the portal, the entirety of Myst was bared before them. It was not a wilderness. It was not earth they set their feet upon, but ceramic tile. They stood on the other side of the portal upon a floating disc attached to a long, long bridge that moved into a central series of platforms that all floated above a lofty bed of clouds way down below. Standing tall in the middle of it all was presumably the Athenaeum of which the Followers of Myst had spoken. A grand building that breached upwards into the cloudless, sunny sky. The time in this realm looked to be identical to what it was before they passed through the portal. The sun was in the same position in the sky, and indeed night would fall in due time despite this place clearly being entirely artificial. It had not occurred naturally. It was not the product of a god. No, the floating discs which where supported by golden, metal hemispheres below them that made for a collection of half-spheres floating together, suspended by bright violet magical crystals that were so massive in size as to make one surely assume each crystal in itself had mana enough to equal a hundred accomplished mages. Outer walls surrounded the city, and the faint sheen of a magical barrier could be seen extending from above the walls up to encapsulate the entire city, including the massive Athenaeum in the middle. There were dots that they could see around the walls, guards presumably, but the distance was long enough that details would be lost on them. A solid ten minute walk from portal to city along a bridge wide enough to support about five or six walking side by side. The bridge was sturdy, and no crosswinds threatened to send anyone careening into the cloudy abyss below. There were also guard rails, naturally, though there didn't seem to be anything stopping someone from just picking another person up and throwing them into what at least appeared to be certain doom. But with such strong magic at work, surely there was another answer. Amara and Amelia began towards the city proper, with Star following only once she looked at Ellesandra to ensure everything was good with them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited, moving to step in last unless Amelia looked like she needed to stay out to maintain the portal. She stayed near Star though, following in with her just to make sure nothing happened to cut them off from one another. When they arrived in Myst, her eyes did a quick scan around to assess for danger first. There didn't seem to be any, but she was still on guard in a completely strange and new land. Her next focus was identifying what defenses she could see in the city, the walls and what looked like guards on them, before taking a moment to appreciate how lovely and magical it all looked. Star's look back at her got her simply nodding to reinforce that all seemed well, but she would follow along behind, looking back at the bridge and then up towards the city. "May I ask, is there anything culturally we should be aware of? Any customs we should follow to ensure we do not unintentionally offend or make enemies in town? You've mentioned not drawing a weapon of course, but that is quite common."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I should hope that one is common, unless you keep company among orcs and goblins," said Amara with a chuckle. "Culturally? Hm..." Amara thought for a moment. "Respect for knowledge is paramount in Myst. The Athenaeum is the culmination of a thousand years of work to diligently maintain records of the written word. Everything from culture, to arcana, to the finest recipes for freshwater fish you've ever known, every effort is made to acquire, preserve, and maintain that knowledge. The Followers of Myst seek to enlighten all others they meet. If there is any questions you have, any thirst for answers you possess, it is one of the missions of the Followers of Myst to aide you in finding the answers you seek. In return, whatever knowledge, whatever skill you have, should be shared with any who wish to know it, insofar as it does not burden you unduly. I saw how you fight. You may find a great many others like you here in the Athenaeum's martial halls. Those who would bear training weapons with you either to teach or be taught by you," explained Amara, though also had Amelia chip in her two cents: "Could also stand to come to learn how to properly cast a Haste spell," she said with a huff. "No doubt you're burning your muscles raw with the way you cast it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra nodded along to what Amara said. There was a tinge of excitement that came up at the idea of exchanging weapon lessons, but it was oddly quickly diminished if Star was paying attention to it. When Amelia chipped in regarding her haste spell, Ellesandra looked amused and tilted her head to the side. "Oh, well if they can I would love to see that, considering I don't cast spells the way most people do. You see most haste spells end after a minute and mine can last for as long as my body and energy can maintain it. I think the longest I've used it for is five minutes before, though I admit I was recovering for two weeks afterwards." Ellesandra would love to learn ways to improve the efficiency of her spells, but with her unique resistance most magical effects didn't work right on her. Other spells that improved her defenses or speed, when cast upon her by other magic users, hardly effected her just like healing did. When Ellesandra cast her own spells, she did so in a way that pulled on her physical strength over her magical, which is why it effected her so. She considered potentially practicing with a mage who could help with that, but being the only one she was aware of who had such resistance, she wasn't sure if someone could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star frowned when she saw the excitement go away. No, no bring that back, hold onto that! She puffed out a cheek, though nobody would really understand why except maybe Ellesandra. Amelia raised a brow at the response. "And you think that's a...Good...Thing?" she asked, her eyes quietly assessing if Ellesandra was crazy. "Listen. Whatever it is about the way you cast, I'm certain it's documented. Arcana of all kinds is the most populated subject in Myst, and subject to the most rigorous study." Amelia seemed quite confident in her assessment, and being that she seemed so comfortable with the arcane it would be easy to believe her, but time would tell who was right. It did at least sound like there were people all around this place that would be able to support Ellesandra in refining their skills, if nothing else. Amara then continued: "Aside from culture, be aware of two things: First, there are a race of elves who live only in Myst. Their homeland was destroyed, and the last of their kind act as the royal guard of Myst. They are known as the Arethi elves. Respect Myst, don't litter, don't deface anything, and I'm sure you'll get along just fine with them. Inside the city, you'll also see automatons walking around. Headless suits of armor that are vaguely like...Fifteen feet tall or so. They just patrol around and act to keep the peace. They are good at not trampling people, but I'd still recommend giving them the right of way as they move around. You'll also even if you don't stay long want to ensure you visit the main office of the library in the Athenaeum to get yourself a library card. You'll need it to borrow books of course, but also it acts as a key to allow you to make portals back to Myst. And, well, if after spending a bunch of time here you feel so inclined, the Followers of Myst is an open guild. Membership in the guild may prove fruitful to you, though of course that is a personal choice for you both to make." Amelia scoffed. "You know you don't have to try and recruit EVERYONE you meet into the guild, right captain?" said Amelia. Amara chuckled in response. "Not everyone. Just the ones who fight well," she said with a brief flash back to Ellesandra and Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Star would see a bit of irritation and defensiveness at Amelia's words. It wasn't that Amelia was right or wrong, it was just how she seemed to assume Ellesandra's magic. Ellesandra was most certainly not versed in magic like Amelia, but there was this kind of arrogant attitude that rubbed her a bit wrong. She didn't dwell on it though, just like the excitement that had been felt earlier it was pushed down, and she nodded. A glance was given over to Star at the comment about the library card and getting back. "We should probably do that, but beyond that I think our main goal is finding a way to get back to your realm, right Star? I don't suppose we'll be staying in the city long on this trip, though any trip back we might have more free time to explore these...archives and the guild you mention." Ellesandra had no interest in joining a guild, and she was sure Star probably didn't right now either, though if she decided to come back to Myst afterwards that might change on her part. No, now their mission was just to find a way to get to Star's home realm, which if there weren't things like portals easily accessible for different realms, they could probably find within the archives. If things went well, they would be at best here for a day or two before being on their way, in Ellesandra's mind. She was also assuming Star would agree on the rush, but that might not be entirely true based on the need in the city.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  As the two continued their walk, they would see that multiple 'arms' like the one they walked upon - bridges that shot out into the cloudy distance at the edges of the realm - were spread off from the main city with meticulously equidistant space between each. They also would have felt the initial tingle of the dampening field the moment they walked in, but by this point its effects were fully felt. A suppression of their magic, squashed down to the tiniest degree. Magic was still there, and Ellesandra would still be able to feel their ability to use it, but it was so utterly miniscule under this effect. Ellesandra's haste spell rather than lasting five minutes would last less than a tenth of a second before fizzling out, and would not hasten them to any discernable degree. It was a method to ensure that things that required magic to function did not break apart or crumble, such as wands or enchanted items. Their magic still sustained, but its ability to do anything was suppressed. So one might wonder if Star could still see emotion with this field pushing down on her. Looking at her, she didn't seem at all very different. Just idly took in the sight of the city as they approached. They neared the wall at this point, which allowed Ellesandra to get a better look at the guards. The Arethi that had been spoken of - juggernauts of elven kind, these guards stood in the range of eight feet tall, and each wore suits of deep purple armor that looked several inches thick in all parts. The bulk of it certainly had to weigh a hundred, two or maybe three hundred pounds on its own. Yet these Arethi, with their pale midnight skin and bright white hair seemed unfazed. Two stood at the gate into the city brandishing massive halberds that had enough metal on the ends to break bones with impact if the blade didn't just cleave clean through their enemy. Upon the rampart of the wall walked archers wielding greatbows - bows that were themselves ten feet from tip to tip and thick enough to allow for absurd amounts of pressure in the draw of the thick metal string, if it could even be called a string. Quivers for these held what would more easily be considered lances that ought to be held by knights on horseback jousting, instead fired like ballista bolts. Of course, the elves above and at the gates were simply on idle watch. Halberds were held at their sides and straight up as their eyes scanned. Archers idly used their massive bows more as walking sticks. It was an intimidating sight to many, but also a reassuring one. There was nothing but pity for whatever might come to Myst with hostile intent if that was the opposition. The elves at the gate would do little more than offer nods of acknowledgement at the party of four if eye contact was made. Else, they just remained on guard, indifferent to the travelers. Once the group stepped into the city itself, it immediately showcased an aesthetic of mathematic precision. The blocks of buildings had equal space between them that lined up from block to block, such that if one looked at the gaps between buildings, it formed a line of sight that went on for as long as the curvature of the circular city permitted before seeing the interior of the wall in that direction. The city was split into sections, floating discs that had been observed from afar. Each was grand in size, but to traverse from one disc to another, one had to cross on a set of two bridges. One for each direction, clearly labeled to ensure logical flow of foot traffic. Some of the buildings were homes - the group seemed to arrive in a residential district, indeed, as it was decorated with trees and greenery and had amenities for children to play on - while others in the distance were clearly businesses. The low rumble of a trade district that was vaguely west of them could be heard. Moving through the city was a consistent motion of walking straight, then turning ninety degrees if needed, and walking straight again until another ninety degree turn was needed. There were no curved roads, save for the outer rim of each disc that supported the buildings. Everything was very...Square. Precise. Intentional. A design iterated a trillion times before a single brick was laid. Each disc had enchanted ceramic tiles to walk upon. Not the softest thing to land on if one stumbled, surely, but made for a pretty, pristine look. Not overly reflective, and not a spec of dirt to be seen upon it. It also didn't *clack* like ceramic should when walked upon. Steps were muted, as if walking on soft earth. All many details to take in as the group entered, things that Star certainly seemed to be eager to drink in with her wandering gaze, though naturally the two guild members were quite used to the sight. Star did nod to Ellesandra's words. "Mmnh, I think I'll need to visit the library to figure that part out specifically. So while you're welcome to join me, it feels a bit wasteful with all the things that are apparently available that you could use your time to enjoy in the meanwhile. Either way, I do agree that I'm sure we'll be on our way again before long."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was much more interested in the defenses of the town than she was the beauty and well-designed architecture or layout of the paths. Her eyes scanned over the walls, watching the archers and the guards curiously. There wasn't any hostile intent; she wasn't necessarily looking for weaknesses or anything, but more taking in how they did things here and comparing it to the little she knew about setting up defenses for a castle. She'd never been in a command position so she hadn't been privy to a lot of that information, but you picked some things up just being a guard in general. As they entered into the city itself, passing the guards and the walls, she finally had begun looking around at the city itself. There was an...efficiency to it, that was both impressive and disappointing. The logical mindset that things seemed to have been laid out was certainly efficient and probably better overall, but to Ellesandra it seemed to take away a bit of the...life of the feel. So clean, proper, and intentional with no room for mistakes, as close to perfection as the city could probably get. Something about it just sat wrong with her, but she didn't really know what or care to examine it; no one was asking her opinion about the city anyways. When Star spoke up about going to the library and ellesandra being free to enjoy her time, there was an indignant shock that coursed through her. She looked at Star as if Star had just grown two more heads. "Star, do you really think I am going to go off to do my own thing while we're in a strange city neither of us know well surrounded by strangers? Just because Black Diamond has indicated they can't get to you here, doesn't mean the Cult of the Faust or whatever they were called can't, or any other number of natural enemies and threats a city might have." She paused, glancing over to Amelia and Amara. "no offense intended." They seemed quite proud and protective of their city, but that didn't mean that any city didn't have it's own dangers to strangers.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star blinked and threw her hands up in defense at Ellesandra's words. "Hey! I'm just trying to give you a chance to not be bored out of your skull. I won't complain if you come look at books with me all day," she said, offering a small smile. "It was just a thought. Not everything needs to revolve around me you know," she added, lowering her hands again. Star wasn't nearly as paranoid as Ellesandra, for better or worse. She cared more about Ellesandra enriching themselves than her getting into a bit of trouble that might have otherwise been avoided, but she could surmise that Ellesandra felt quite different. Amara just chuckled at Ellesandra's words. "None taken, Ellesandra. There's not much crime here, but it's not like there's zero. She said she was your guard, right Star? Let her do her job then. Even if the Followers would join to aide you if something happened, there's something to be said about your knight's strong gaze and the ability of such a thing to deter a would-be criminal before they even act," was Amara's contribution to the topic. Amelia, meanwhile, focused on something else: "Cult of Faust? Jeez. How many enemies have you two made? I'm almost impressed."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
To be fair, Ellesandra had only made enemies by following and protecting Star. In reality, they were Star's enemies, and she still wasn't entirely sure why. She just shook her head at Star. "If it will make you feel better, I'll request books about magic while I'm with you so I'm not, as you say, revolving around you. And so Amelia doesn't give me the scolding she would a five year old who performs magic poorly." There was wry amusement in her tone, considering it was literally her job to revolve around Star. She also tried to alleviate some of the tension she felt between herself and Amelia. Or maybe that was all on her side? Either way, a cursory glance was given around to ensure there was no one following them or close by to overhear, before she continued in regards to the Cult of Faust. "As for the Cult, they're allies of Die is all. I'm not sure if they particular care about finding Star or not, but if they're allies Die may send them after us as well, since they can't seem to get into Myst themselves for whatever reason." A brief explanation without needing to go into it. Important for Amara and Amelia to know in case something went down, but just the 'need to know' type information. She would look back to Star, checking in that her sharing this would be okay; it was Star's journey after all. She didn't want to overshare anything Star would prefer to keep to herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Ellesandra's discretion was thoughtful, Star clearly had no issues with Ellesandra sharing. Truly, Star didn't care what Ellesandra shared about her among allies. She was a very trusting individual, and if information passed by Ellesandra's scrutiny of needing to share, it had already done that and more by Star. She didn't say as much, but the pleasant expression she had might make Ellesandra question why they were being discreet in the first place. "Hey captain, looks like she's not hopeless after all," said Amelia with a grin while looking at Ellesandra. The same attitude was in her voice as with all the things she said. There didn't seem to be tension. Maybe Amelia was just a brat? Amara just shook her head, clearly used to Amelia's attitude. Star did seem to find it a good compromise. "Mn, well, as long as you aren't feeling like your time is being wasted, I'm content," said Star, keeping her usual air of care for Ellesandra alive and well. "I wouldn't be able to guarantee you that no such activity exists in this place," began Amara. "But if any cultists are among the peoples here, they'll be little more than listening ears and watching eyes, for the moment they try anything more they'll find it a quick way to taste the ceramics below our feet." As she said this, one of the previously mentioned automatons crossed their path. Amara and Amelia stopped in their stride briefly as the hulking, ten foot tall suit of armor walked past with mechanical rigidity. The headless suit of armor shone with a polished, silvery sheen, and seemed to be doing little more than just walking around, being a presence. Two small purple crystals with gold bands around the central bulge of the rhomboidal shapes followed behind the automaton. One briefly moved over to the group of four, with a purple orb of mana appearing vaguely in the shape of a stylized eye above it that 'looked' at Ellesandra, then Star, each for a second or two, before rejoining the other crystal in following the automaton. "Scrying sensors, before you ask," said Amelia with her usual attitude. "They check for any nefarious magic, or shady deeds. You never know when one's watching, which does a great deal to get anyone with ill intentions nice and paranoid." With that brief lecture over, the group resumed their walk towards the athenaeum.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra still felt uneasy sharing information, even despite Star's apparent trusting attitude. she'd been trained too well to keep her client's secrets. The idea of her time being wasted by just keeping guard around Star made her shake her head again. "It's not wasted time, it's my job, Star. Unless you think my job is a waste of time?" The poke, daring Star to say that Ellesandra job was a waste, was a tease of course. She knew Star appreciated that Ellesandra was there, unpaid in reality but either way still there doing her job, even if she didn't think it was necessary all the time. A simple nod was given to Amara at the explanation, eyes scanning the large automaton up and down as it passed. It was interesting, and probably an efficient guard against many things in the city, but she had to wonder what controlled it and what would happen if someone or something somehow took control of them away from the city. It sounded like a disaster waiting to happen, but that same risk was there if there were people in charge of protection so, maybe not necessarily a higher risk than any other setup. "The question is, if we're intended to share knowledge in exchange for it, Star, what do you suggest we offer? Beyond my training, I'm not sure I've got any particular information that might be worth a lead on the right portal to your realm, and I'm sure you have no desire to put more information about your magic out there while you're still figuring it out yourself?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star gave a playful squint at Ellesandra for the tease. "Listen, you," she said with a giggle, not really having any follow up to that but just making it even more obvious that Ellesandra couldn't be further from the truth. She then looked...A little surprised, pleasantly so, at Ellesandra's question. She nodded. "Mn, that's right." The surprise seemed to stem from the fact that Ellesandra was able to know exactly how Star felt about it without her having had to explain it at all. It wasn't the biggest mystery in the world, but there was a...Subtle blush to her cheeks in the wake of this. "It needn't be anything novel," chimed in Amara. "There remain many novices, people willing and wanting to learn. Passing knowledge or skill is a service, and such service is returned in kind. Knowledge for knowledge. If you do find yourself pressed to provide, I'm certain that an agreement can be made for your service in instructing others in the way of the blade, or Star instructing in the way of the arcane." A prospect that had Star looking...Quite nervous indeed. The two drew closer to the athenaeum, and its grandness only became more apparent as they crossed the bridge to the central disc that housed it. It was imposing. A structure to dwarf even grand castles, its exterior made of some pristine white stone. Unlike the square and precise rest of the city, the athenaeum carried a far more...Mystic air about it. Asymmetries, curves, and decorative adornments abounded upon the exterior. The main entrance before them was a large series of steps up to what was a gaping maw of an entryway. Massive pillars stood dozens of feet apart as the main entry just seemed to go up, and up, and up...It had a way of making one feel so utterly small and insignificant in its grand scale. Once stepping in, the vertical magnitude was preserved as steps went down into the main floor of the front foyer of the athenaeum. Squared rooms could seen lining one wall with lights on in some, off in others. The other wall was a wall of bookshelves that, by itself, surely contained a million books, if not much more. Magical orbs floated up and around on this wall of books, magically retrieving them at the request of clerks that flew the books back down to ground level where a myriad of people were requesting or returning works. Desks upon desks upon desks upon desks were laid out in precise uniformity to allow any who walked in to perform their study with the requested work. Of course, the athenaeum went deeper than this opening room. The grand opening hall had a dizzying number of branching paths off it, ascending, descending, going left and right, with teleportation circles drawn on some rooms to the sides of the hall that were clearly labeled with both a numbering system that followed some decimal logic, but deciphering whether one needed to go to 1.13: Alchemical Reagents or 1.92: Botanical Specimens or 2.87: Cardiovascular Conditioning or 101.22: Archival Nexus was an intimidating prospect that would make getting lost all too easy. Splitting up certainly seemed like a bad idea not because of being attacked, but for the risk of never finding each other ever again. Or even being able to find one's way back to the entrance again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She'd assumed there was a reason that Star's family didn't share their magic widely. To share that information at a place where people came to study a lot seemed like a good way to put a spotlight on them and their unique abilities. It also seemed like a good way to put a target on Star's back. Not to mention she'd seemed to hold information back about her mother, Ellesandra had just been assuming. The surprise on Star's face didn't even register though. She'd begun looking around again, considering. She hadn't taken a student since Marigold, and the memory of that sent a pang of grief going through her, but it was contained and minimal. Could she take another student, even if it was just one or two lessons while they were in the city? That was an option, and after glancing at Star and seeing how nervous she looked, probably one of the more likely options. As they approached the athenaeum, Ellesandra took some time to appreciate it's size and impressive structure. She wasn't an artist or an architect, but she could tell something like this was impressive. There was also something lovely about the asymmetries in it, compared to how structured and efficiently designed the city was. She appreciated the curves and how it wasn't all...box-like, straight lines. Her gaze turned up, her 5'1 form feeling even smaller in comparison to it, before glancing over to Star with concern as they saw the inside. It would be all too easy to lose Star around a corner or something, and spend hours searching for her charge without being able to find her. That thought made her step up closer to Star, to ensure something like that didn't happen. If there was someone here who knew this building well from years of travelling it, they would likely be able to easily run from Ellesandra in here and get away; she didn't want anyone to do that having kidnapped Star for whatever reason.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star looked at Ellesandra briefly when they stepped closer. A small smile graced her lips. Though it might have been something Ellesandra didn't think about, or perhaps they did, Star still was able to see emotions even with the oppressive dampening field upon them all. Her auramancy remained unaffected, though she wasn't about to announce as much until the two were in private. "All right, well. I guess this is where we figure out what we're doing," said Amelia, arms crossed. She turned then to look at Star and Ellesandra. "After that fight, I'm tapped out, so I'll be combat ineffective for the next few days. So if you want a guide for the day so you don't get lost, I've -- well, I DO have better things to do, but the thought of you two getting lost is too sad." Something about this attitude had Star giggling. A giggle that had Amelia stiffening a little and looking away with a tint of red on her cheeks. Star clearly knew something; a small reminder that it wasn't just Ellesandra's emotions that Star could see. Amara just planted her clean, non-bloodied hand on Amelia's head and rubbed, evoking some sputters from the shorter of the two women. "Your offer is appreciated I'm sure, Amelia. I'll be going to my quarters to clean up, but once I'm back in civilian clothes I can join you all again, if you don't mind the company. Though if you two would prefer to go it alone, you can always rely on the magical guide for the Athenaeum. Her name is Capi. Just preface her name with 'pardon me' or 'excuse me' or a greeting and she'll show up somewhere nearby to help guide you around. Talking to her can be a bit stiff, but you get used to it." Whether taking the offered guidance of the locals or this 'Capi', it was useful knowledge regardless that there was some sort of guidance for this labyrinthine archive. Star looked at Ellesandra, a look that asked for their opinion on the matter.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra noticed the small smile, and hadn't even considered whether or not Star's ability would be effected by this. She'd just assumed it wasn't, for some reason. Maybe because it wasn't typical arcane magic, and Ellesandra just...knew that? Either way, she glanced over to Amelia as she spoke, watching the suggestion that she had better things to do. There was a small bit of annoyance again, but Ellesandra didn't show it so that only Star would notice. She wasn't sure if Amelia was just being a type of brat who says they hated something but truly liked it or wanted to do it, or if she legitimately just had that attitude. Considering Star giggling, Ellesandra glanced between the two and then sighed. Being led around by Amelia didn't exactly sound like the best time in the world, but their explanation of this odd magical guide put Ellesandra on edge. Definitely preferred living company that she relatively trusted not to backstab them, considering Amelia and Amara had fought beside them without question, to a magical guide that might have...uncertain allegiances or ability to corrupt. When Star looked at her for the suggestion, Ellesandra shrugged. "It's your decision. My vote would be for the two we trust over some random guide, though I certainly wouldn't want to put them out if they have much better things to be doing." This last bit was directed at Amelia and Ellesandra looked towards her, a single eyebrow raising. She was taking the giggle from Star as evidence to call Amelia on her faux reason that they were such a bother. "I'm sure we'd be able to find our way eventually, or ask someone else. Star is quite good with people." While Ellesandra was the typical person who didn't ask for directions unless she absolutely needed to.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star glanced at Ellesandra with an amused smile. While it was true that she was good with people, to know that Ellesandra was coming to rely on her for as much was...Cute. She had to wonder what Ellesandra would do had she not been here, or in some alternate reality where she was even grumpier than Ellesandra. She imagined they would get by, of course. But it more had her wondering if her people skills were a minor convenience or as far as a crutch for Ellesandra. A question left unasked as Ellesandra's comment evoked a small fluster and blush from Amelia, who crossed her arms in defiance. "It's FINE," said Amelia emphatically. "Someone's gotta help you before you go wandering around getting lost. And I'd not trust half the people who even live here to know what they're talking about, so it can't be helped," she continued, which if Ellesandra looked at Star would see that Star was having a difficult time containing herself. A hand even went over her own lips to keep herself silent. Yes, Star could see straight through Amelia's tough front, and apparently saw something worth smiling about underneath it all. Amelia took the opportunity to turn and walk further into the athenaeum. "Come on, we need to get to the main office so you can meet the head librarian and get your cards. Don't fall behind, either!"
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra held back the smirk that wanted to play at Amelia's response. The thought in the back of her mind was 'i bet she's a bratty sub for Amara', and a quick glance was given to Amara, but Ellesandra didn't voice any of this. There was a brief moment when she wondered how much of that thought Star could see, which caused her to glance over to Star as well, a bit sheepishly, but she reminded herself Star couldn't read minds, just emotion. And Ellesandra had been amused, but not horny or anything like that, so she wasn't going to be able to tell, right? She hoped that's how the auramancy worked anyways; she had enough issues with the idea of Star reading her emotions. "Thank you, oh benevolent native citizen lowering yourself to help bumbling tourists like us." The words weren't said for Amelia to hear, more just mumbled to herself in that same amusement. Ellesandra was latching onto the amusement as a positive emotion right now, something to focus on rather than the...well...everything that she'd experienced in the memories just before coming here. It was a distraction, a way to help her push those down without focusing on them. As they were encouraged not to fall behind, Ellesandra began walking behind Amelia and following her, her main focus being on Star to ensure that Star followed as well and didn't get lost in any shuffling.

  Amara met the look, but it wasn't the look of someone who was trying to communicate that she was involved with Amelia, but rather the look of a big sister who was light-heartedly apologizing for her little sister being such a brat. "Your bedside manner is as exemplary as ever, Amelia," said Amara as they began walking. There wasn't too much worry about getting lost in a crowd; there were lots of people, certainly, but the athenaeum was just so...Big. There was too much room for people to keep distant, and the way everything was laid out encouraged orderly passage to get from one place to the next. Star caught Ellesandra's mumbling and put a hand over her mouth to snicker to herself. She made a passing comment for just Ellesandra to hear: "She doesn't have an ounce of conviction behind that attitude. She's SUCH a softie." Ellesandra seemed to have picked up on it themselves, but the happy mood left her happy to joke about it a bit more. Star also had been giving a look - THAT look - at Amara a few times as they were together. She seemed to see...something. But she didn't say anything about whatever she saw. The group moved through the athenaeum's main hall to arrive at a collection of magical circles, each in its own inset into the wall of the circular room. Each circle was labeled; the two fluffy-eared guides moved to the circle labeled 100.1: Library Services. Amelia simply touched her foot to the circle, and an opaque, square blue portal opened in the wall behind it. The inset in the wall and portal were quite large, about twenty feet up and across. The whole of the athenaeum did seem to be built to accommodate larger individuals. When the group stepped through the portal, the receiving section had its own series of other circles that led to different places, but they were not heading to such places. Instead, they moved down a short passage to arrive at what appeared to be the central administration of the athenaeum. Massive glass windows poured in sunlight from the wall to the side of the desk, adjacent to the inlet room they walked in from. The windows also gave a sense of height; seemed they were much, much higher up now. A brief jaunt over to look out the window would reveal quite a moment of vertigo as the ground floor was dozens of floors below them now, enough that people were now but black dots. And yet, from outside it was clear there was much higher the building could go. Regardless, a semi-rounded desk made of exquisite wood and beautiful detailing that etched runes and glyphs of all sort of arcana into the front panel was before them, with piles of books seen in neat and organized and labeled collections behind on some other tables, a section that was blocked by the desk itself and the adjoining walls. For staff only, of course. Amelia and Amara came up to the desk. There was nobody present initially, though a woman with shimmering red hair which swept over one eye soon walked into view holding a stack of books which she set into one of the other piles, scrawled a little note on some parchment she had sitting nearby, then moved to the seat behind the desk. The woman had very visible scars upon her face and arms, though her long sleeves did attempt to hide the scarring on her arms, and her hair attempted to do the same with the one over her eye. It didn't conceal them enough to avoid them being visible, but it was clear she was...Trying to hide them. Enough that it was obviously something she wasn't wanting to talk about, though with them being so bright against her pale skin it was equally obvious she knew people noticed them despite her attempts to conceal them. Amara smiled at the woman. "Good day, Serenity. We've brought you some people in need of library cards," said Amara, earning a smile from Serenity as she looked at Star and Ellesandra. She then briefly looked aside and grabbed a black slate from a wooden drawer behind the desk. She laid the slate upon the top of the desk. It had bright purple runes etched into it in a circle that was sized to be large enough to accommodate a palm within the magical circle upon it. She then produced two copies of parchment with paired inkwells and writing quills. "Splendid," began Serenity. "If you could please, just a few formalities to square away," she said, gesturing to the papers. The papers had been prepared to request basic information. Name, first, last, and middle. Age. Race. Gender. Though the one that one might not expect to see was 'Plane of residence'. The implication was clear that Star and Ellesandra were to complete the forms before getting the cards; Star moved up to the desk, having no qualms with the process.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The apologetic look didn't do anything, along with the comment from Amara, to make Ellesandra think anything other than them being involved. it was possible that they weren't, but the vibe was there. Maybe it was only one directional? Ellesandra didn't know, she didn't have the insight that Star did or the ability to just read people well. Still, she followed along, glancing sidelong at Star at the comment about Amelia being a softy. There was a moment of...displeasure. A squinting of the eyes and a general feeling of unease and discomfort with Star sharing something about someone's emotions. It was a very minor thing, considering Star was just sharing that she was a softie, and that was something Ellesandra had kind of already worked out anyways, but the idea behind it was more what bothered Ellesandra. She didn't comment, though she knew she didn't need to in order for Star to see that she hadn't been comfortable with it. Ellesandra was big on boundaries, and she still maintained that seeing people's emotions like Star did was an unintentional invasion of them. Sharing what she saw with Ellesandra seemed a step further - that bit Star could control. But as soon as the discomfort settled in, she knew Star would see it and if she didn't say something would retreat and feel bad about herself again - at least if she was able to tell what caused it. "It's okay." Ellesandra muttered, trying to reassure Star before that could happen. But before she could go further, they found themselves opening a portal of some kind, or at least some sort of light that Amelia triggered. Ellesandra went into guard mode, eyeing the portal and the surroundings suspiciously and with caution, distracted from what she was going to say. As they approached the central administration, still on guard, she turned her eyes to the apparent librarian, Serenity. There was recognition of the scars, but other than a small amount of curiosity at what caused them Ellesandra didn't respond. She wasn't going to ask - it certainly wasn't her place - and she wasn't going to feel sorry for the woman. She probably got that plenty from the general public, anyways. When paper was handed over, she glanced over to Star to ensure everything seemed okay with her, and then stepped up after her when Star moved up to complete the forms. Ellesandra Rhinelander, no middle name. Human, to the best of her knowledge. Woman, AFAB, She/Her. She put down her plane of residence and the other basic information necessary, only stopping momentarily halfway through to glance around and ensure that no one was approaching while the two were busy filling out paperwork.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It didn't matter that Ellesandra said it was okay. It suddenly was anything but okay. The dour mood struck Star like a spear, and she wasn't likely to have anything else to say for a good long while. So there was nothing else to do but follow along in her silence as they moved to the administration. Some minor notice had been taken of how Star went from bright giggles to very visibly neutral at best, upset at worst. But nobody but Ellesandra was close enough to her to interject or ask about it. They went through the motions, filled things out and handed them back to Serenity. "Good, good," she said, looking over the paperwork and finding it to be in order. "Now if you could please place your hand upon the black slate there, one at a time, it will imprint your magical signature upon your card. This is done to ensure only you are able to use the card for transit back to Myst." Once more, something that Star did without any notable hesitation. The sigils glowed when she rest her palm upon it, and Serenity seemed busy with some magical process at the same time that resulted in all of the details and the signature being transcribed onto a small metal card which bore a small purple gem inset into the card in the corner of it. Once the process was done, Star was handed her card which had all the details that were written out. She held onto it for the moment as she stepped aside, letting Ellesandra repeat the process assuming they had no objection to doing so.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	The guilt was immediate, with how Star seemed to shut right the hell up. She'd been giggly at looking at Amelia before, and now Ellesandra's own discomfort had caused her to shut down. She'd clenched her jaw, not sure how to make it better since the immediate 'it's fine' obviously hadn't worked. She wasn't good at this shit, and it didn't help that she knew that now Star was seeing both her guilt, and frustration at a combination of the situation and herself. That only led into a bit more of frustration, but that was a repeating cycle Ellesandra wouldn't let herself go down right now. She'd watched the magical imprint happening on Star first, eyes wary, but when Star stepped back to let Ellesandra repeat the process she did so. She focused on the task and making sure that she wasn't intentionally absorbing any magic from the process, unsure how it would work on her but willing it to work as best it can, stepping back when finished and looking at Serenity to silently confirm if everything had gone through fine. While doing so, she reached out and lightly wrapped her fingers around Star's upper arm. It was a gentle squeeze before release, knowing physical touch helped reassure Star more than words ever would, and it not exactly being a place that Ellesandra felt comfortable hugging Star if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The magic slate did not absorb any magic. Rather, it responded to the natural magic that coursed through Ellesandra, reading it and forming what it was exposed to into some sort of signature that bound the magic of the gem to Ellesandra and Ellesandra alone. Not invasive in the slightest. Serenity did the same process, producing a card to hand to Ellesandra. Then, the small squeeze on Star's arm had her looking away from the knight, as if trying to hide her sorrow. The walls were...Mostly up. But they did struggle to maintain when Star was distressed, or any other strong emotion surged in her. And in the moment, the guilt, the shame, the sorrow were all prominent, and even without focusing on them specifically, Ellesandra touching Star would expose them to those same emotions.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took the card, but had frowned at the connection she felt from Star. Even with the barrier up as it was she'd felt that guilt and...shame? Was that Star recognizing how invasive it was, even if she couldn't control it? The sorrow was probably due to Ellesandras own reaction if she had to guess. Either way, she hated seeing Star shut down like that, and how she'd turned away from Ellesandra was unusual. Normally, Star wasn't ashamed to show her emotions. So, after receiving the library card and slipping it into a pocket in her pack, she stepped back and turned to look at Star. Her mouth opened, then closed. She didn't know what to do and say, and a public place didn't seem like the right moment to do this. After pursing her lips for a moment, she turned back to Amelia and Amara. "Perhaps you can point us in the right direction to start our research, and then show us a place we can stay today? I think we need to do some unwinding after the unfortunate fight earlier." Ellesandra placed a hand on her right ribs to help indicated where she'd been struck. Oh sure she'd been healed, but it was still sore and tender, as most of the healing had been focused on mending the bones in her arm and healing overall wasn't super effective on her to begin with. It wasn't a total lie, even if she was masking the real purpose.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara gently nodded to the words. "Aye. I ought to clean up," she said, earning a personal interjection from Serenity. "...Please do clean up before you go touching any materials, yes, Amara," said Serenity with a light tone. The relationship there was clearly positive. "Yes, yes, I won't go getting blood over your books, Serenity," responded Amara with a chuckle. "You mean won't go doing it...AGAIN...Right Amara?" responded the librarian, earning an amused roll of the eyes from Amara. "Like I said, I'll be sure to bleed more carefully," she said with another chuckle. She then looked towards Ellesandra. "I'll leave you in Amelia's care then. But I'd like to chat tonight, just the two of us, if you can find some time for me, Ellesandra." An open offer, one made with a smile, before Amara excused herself to go find a place to clean up. Amelia just had eyes shifting all around throughout, arms folded. "You can bunk for free in the guild hotel while you're here, since it'd just be a few days. That won't be a problem, right, Serenity?" asked Amelia, indicating that Serenity had some authority over her. Serenity gently shook her head. "Plenty of room. Doesn't take a genius to see they were helpful in a pinch, so better the rooms get used instead of collecting dust," said Serenity. Amelia nodded, then perked up. "Oh, as for research, uh, what was the home plane you're looking to research, Star?" asked Amelia, bringing Star out of her funk for a moment to reply, though even that was lacking her usual brightness. "Oh, uhm. Gurhal," came her response. Amelia wore a difficult expression at that, suggesting she'd never heard of it. Not that never having heard of one of the countless planes was too strange, but Amelia did consider herself well read enough to know about most of the large, civil ones. Serenity perked up as well, eyeing Star with curiosity. "Gurhal? We do have some material pertaining to that plane, yes. Though I admit, it's not as comprehensive as I'd like...I don't...I don't suppose you've any intention on bringing any allies with you?" With the understanding that Myst had a desire to collect knowledge, it seemed to present an opportunity for aide, in the interest of collecting knowledge from Gurhal.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The exchange between Amara and Serenity would normally have made Ellesandra smile. Her eyes flicked between them and the clearly teasing relationship they had, eyeing Amara and wondering just how often she got bloody and then went to the library, but her attention was pulled again over to Star, concern going through her. The thing was, she couldn't even just hold her tongue to avoid upsetting Star; she had to completely mask her emotion from her in situations like that, and Ellesandra wasn't even sure it was possible. She was drawn back into the main conversation when Amara spoke to her, inviting her to have a private chat that evening. Ellesandra tilted her head to the side, curious and...cautious. A glance was given to Star, then back to Amara. There was obvious hesitancy to leave Star in order to have a private conversation with Amara that evening. "I won't promise anything." Was the only response. She was open to chatting, but she wasn't going to commit to stepping away from her role long enough to have a personal conversation with Amara. At the confirmation of being able to bunk, she refocused on what they were doing and their goal, glancing at Star when she mentioned her home plane, then back at Serenity who seemed...interested in that option. And the option of having allies sent with them. When Star didn't immediately answer that question, Ellesandra stepped in. "Give us some time to consider our research and goals and have a conversation before we commit to allowing allies to be brought with us or not." This was entirely Star's decision, though Ellesandra would certainly encourage it if she'd be open to it. She knew that they'd have to fight Black Diamond in some form or fashion on the other side of the portal, considering that it was their group that had captured Aurora. It was way too optimistic to hope they could pull of a stealth rescue mission without getting into some form of a fight, especially considering how Ellesandra wasn't exactly a stealthy type. Not to mention, when was Ellesandra optimistic about a mission anymore?
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	"Of course, of course," said Serenity, realizing she had been rushing them. She raised her hands, aiming to placate any notion that she was pressuring them. "If you'd like to show them to their quarters then, Amelia, I can see that the relevant materials are fetched from the archives," she said, a flash of recognition on the librarian's face that the group needed some alone time. "Just have your cards ready if you'd like to take the materials out of Myst on loan. There are plenty of places to return the books otherwise, or you can give them to Capi." With that, Serenity deferred to Amelia, who put one hand on her hip and nudged her head in an animated way for the others to follower her back to the collection of half a dozen magic circles. There was one that was unlabeled, one that seemed to require a bit more than just stepping on the circle as Amelia briefly concentrated on her own magic to set the destination of the portal before it opened. And when stepping through this portal, the group was brought to the guild hall of the Followers of Myst. It was, like the rest of the athenaeum, expansive and proud in its construction. The symbol of the guild was hung on blue banners sporting white trim, depicting an open book emblazoned on a shield. Defenders of knowledge, or so seemed to be the implication. The main entrance to the hall was a general area, with tables set up for the gathering space, a staffed counter off to the right once progressing through the entry corridor, which had kegs of ale and some guild members dining on plates of food that smelled fairly nice. Nobody paid much attention to Star or Ellesandra, though Amelia seemed to turn a few heads. The furry-eared woman shot harsh glances around at a few choice people who saw fit to get clear out of their path of walking and strike a stance of respect in response. Amelia led the two through the main gathering hall, up a flight of steps, and through another corridor to find another corridor lined with doors. She walked along, looking at the name plates for each room. They followed a logical progression. G1. G3. G5. On the other side was G2. G4. G6. The nameplates glowed with soft gold, until Amelia found one - G17 - that was not glowing gold, but blue. She twisted the knob and pushed the door in, then motioned inwards for the other two. "All yours," she said, clearly allowing them in with the intent of departing soon after. "I'm in room FC3 if you need me. Down the hall there, just check the prefix of the doors, you'll find the FC rooms eventually." Assuming there was no further questions, the two were free to enter the room which had two beds, two writing desks, two dressers which had towels and a few pairs of evening wear that were vaguely small, medium, and large in size. Likely to not fit the best, but they were clean and cotton and clearly free to be used if desired. Once the two entered, the nameplate acquired a golden hue instead of its blue one. And Star was fine to go along with it all without a word, following whatever Ellesandra decided to do.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra followed along with Amelia once it was all confirmed with Serenity they could come back later to get the necessary materials. She watched the way the portal was opened, trying to keep everything in mind in case they, for any odd reason, needed to open a portal of their own using one of these devices. As they entered the guildhall, she kept an eye out on the people around them, keeping close to Star just in case and walking along as they got to the apparent room that Amelia was leaving them in. A glance was given to it, just looking in briefly to confirm what was in there and ensuring there wasn't anyone else in the room. She stepped aside to let Star in, but even as she did she turned to look at Amelia before she could walk off. "Can you let me know how I can contact one of you, or travel via those...teleportation things if we decide to go out?" She wanted to have some autonomy, or the option of it, in this strange town. They had mentioned reaching out to that magical guide as a possibility, which would be a last resort for her honestly. Also, she assumed Amara would come find her later if she wanted to have that talk still, but either way. Ellesandra stood in the door way, letting Star head into the bedroom while waiting on an answer from Amelia.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Amelia paused for a moment, then reached into a pouch that was concealed by her frilly dress. She produced a small metal coin-like object. It was circular and seemed to be made of brass, hard to mix up with a gold piece in colour, let alone shape. Upon the coin was a pair of lips. "It's a Sending Stone. Or, rather, Sending Coin. I'm sure you're familiar, but in case you're not, you can use it to send a message to the paired coin, which I have on me. Twenty four words maximum per message. Goes both ways. Messages are telepathic, so you don't need to say anything out loud and look like a weirdo talking to yourself. As for the 'teleportation things'," she said with raised fingers to do mocking air quotes, clearly not one to miss out on a chance to be a brat about her magical aptitude. "They're teleportation circles. You just attune it to where you want to go, though that requires you...Know where you want to go with it. They interconnect all through the athenaeum, so you should at least be able to figure out how to get back to the library services office, or the main foyer with them. Else, just step on the circles that have a label that sounds like somewhere you want to go, and if you get lost just ask Capi what to do. It's what she's there for, you know."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took the coin, taking a moment to turn it over a few times in her hand to inspect it. A sending coin was neat, and that would be able to connect to Amelia. There was a pang of regret that it didn't go to Amara instead, since she felt like she'd get alone with Amara more than Amelia, but she didn't look a gift horse in the mouth or say anything about that. Amelia was being very kind to share this, as well as to show them around when needed. The air quotes caused her eyes to narrow at Amelia with no real malice or intent behind them, lips pursed, but nodding at the explanation. "Thank you." And always the obvious lack of being a social butterfly, Ellesandra stepped into the room and closed the door behind her after thanking Amelia, considering that conversation absolutely done. She was still holding the coin and looked down at it, before moving it in to place in a pocket as well, away from her coin purse in case she accidentally got them mixed up somehow when not paying attention. After doing so, she stepped in to lower the pack down in a corner and looked to Star. "So, what's going on?" Ellesandra starting the conversation was an olive branch, hopefully. There was obvious discomfort in doing so, knowing this might be an emotion filled conversation and that Star wasn't feeling well and being unsure how that was going to go. Would Star cry? Would she be angry at Ellesandra for her continued discomfort with her powers? Ellesandra was prepping herself for either, unsure how this would go at all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amelia was left to stand in the hallway after having the door closed on her face. Well. How rude. But she didn't linger on it and walked off. Star had helped herself to sitting on her bed. The two beds were separated only by the distance of the nightstand between them, with a few inches of berth on either side. A fair bit closer than the hotel at Cloverport, but not the closest the two had been in terms of sleeping arrangements. Certainly more space than in the tent. Star was sitting, quiet, and pulled her legs up to her chest and hugged them. So when Ellesandra asked what was going on, she shrunk into herself a little more. "...W-What do you mean? I'm just...S-Sorry for making you uncomfortable, is all."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't consider it rude, having obviously been the end of the conversation, but either way. When she watched Star pull her legs up to her chest and hug them, Ellesandra moved to sit on the opposite bed, feet on the floor and elbows moving to rest on her knees. She leaned forward, hands clasped in front of her as Star shrunk into herself, lowering her head to try to meet Star's eyes. "Star, you're pulling a me. I don't know why, either. If that is what will work for you and what you need to do, far be it for me to stop you from withdrawing and closing in on yourself, but that's not normal for you, so I'm worried." Her words were serious, not teasing or poking fun of Star, or even degrading herself for how she handled emotions. She was frowning, watching Star closely. "Your powers make me uncomfortable Star, not you. And that's not something you have control over, and I'm working on getting over. You sharing what you saw made me uncomfortable because that's something I don't feel like I should have full access to knowing. If I were Amelia, I would feel bothered that you shared that with someone else, even if you knowing it is forgivable since you can't control it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "There's obviously so many things that I see that I don't share with you, or with anyone," she said, having shrunk even more tightly into herself as Ellesandra laid things out for her. Facing that she had done something to make Ellesandra uncomfortable wasn't the primary concern; she had done so before and could do so as many times as she needed to, owning her mistakes as they came. "But I saw how her attitude made you angry. How you didn't see it was just a face she wears. I didn't want you two to be at odds." She also felt like she would have been able to intuit the same information without her powers, but she couldn't know that and didn't want to seem arrogant. Maybe her powers did make all the difference in this instance. She didn't know. "But like I said...I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore. I'll be normal. I don't want you to be uncomfortable around me. I'm sorry." The repeated apologies, the fearful tone in her voice, the tears that were pooling in the corner of her eyes...This all certainly was contributing to her state, but it certainly seemed by this abnormal withdrawal that there was more to it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Angry? She frowned, not having realized she'd felt angry at Amelia. Star wasn't wrong, she'd felt defensive and angry and irritated at Amelia poking at their lack of magical intelligence - specifically at Ellesandra's lack of it. There were reasons for that, which she very much ignored and pretended didn't exist, just like everything emotional since the incident. She scratched at the back of her head while watching Star come close to breaking down. The tears pooling in her eyes was unfortunately becoming a normal sight, but the fear in her voice was very much not. And it stirred something in Ellesandra. The protectiveness, the anger at herself for doing something that brought Star to that point. Previously when Ellesandra had reached out to hold Star, it had been...obligatory, in a way. A 'I know this will help you, and I want you to stop crying, so here.' This time, though, there was a desire to wrap Star in her arms and protect her from the world, from herself. A desire to make that fear go away, whatever was causing it. There was a moment of hesitation before Ellesandra moved, her own disinterest in being close to someone coming up, but after just a second of that she moved to sit next to Star and then turned fully to her to embrace her. No small side hug, gentle touches to let Star get the physical comfort. Ellesandra fully turned and wrapped her arms around Star from the side, pulling her into her armored chest and tilting her head to the side so that Star's head could rest in the crook of her neck. "Star." She whispered, assuming Star allowed the embrace. "It. Is. Okay. Okay?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Physical comfort was important to Star. Even when it had been obligatory, there was a strong comfort that came with being held, and being able to hold Ellesandra in turn. So a genuine hug, even if it was against armor, was a powerful thing. Star wasn't someone who closed off, not someone who shut herself away from others. And though she had learned to try her best to prevent her emotions from bleeding into Ellesandra's aura, it had always required focus. Focus she didn't have while her heart was in turmoil. So the floodgates were open, and when Ellesandra held her, the emotions that Star felt blossomed into the periphery of Ellesandra's mind. Not felt as their own, but able to feel them and understand them all the same. There was fear, but it would take specific focus to understand the purpose, the source of the fear. For the moment, it was scattered and aimless. There was also loneliness, though Ellesandra's hug was chipping away at that. Still...It would be easy to wonder why she felt lonely when they had been traveling together, when they had even been in a group and laughing earlier. The sorrow, which was obvious, and connected to all the other dark feelings. Shame...There certainly was shame, self directed and inwardly focused. Shame about herself. Shame that had only seemed to grow stronger in each of these glimpses into Star's heart over the time Ellesandra had known her. There was also...longing. Vague and formless, it spurred an ache in he heart to focus on it, even if its purpose or foundation was a mystery. The longing and loneliness tied together to form into a deep vulnerability. A sensitive heart that signaled to Ellesandra that one wrong word could break Star's heart in the moment. There was also a similarly formless...Anger? It didn't seem to mesh with the other emotions. It was just there, floating around in her, wound up in a ball of frustration and...Jealousy? Star certainly did know how to deal with her emotions better than most, but that didn't mean she was immune to the uglier feelings the human heart was prone to feel. Though it would take another like Star to decipher these emotions with this mystic connection alone. All there was to do for someone who didn't have that gift was either to focus on them intently to try and understand, to ignore them completely, or to talk, and ask. At the very least, the sweet words of being told it was okay were...Mildly helpful. Combined with the hold which she of course didn't resist in the slightest, there was clear comfort reaching her, even if it wasn't enough to fix whatever was wrong.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Like the previous times when she'd touched Star and the barrier had been down, Ellesandra strongly focused on NOT focusing on these emotions. She could feel and sense they were there, but Ellesandra respected that privacy and boundary way too much to try to delve into them or acknowledge that they were there. It would be incredibly hypocritical if she decided to go into them, even if Star would probably be okay with it. As Star fell into the embrace, Ellesandra squeezed lightly at Star's side, and then pulled away for a moment. Her arms were still around Star, but she wasn't actively pulling her close anymore. "Star. I can't help you if you don't tell me what's bothering you. I'm okay just holding you if you prefer that, but as much as I'm not a talker, I know you are." She watched Star, then either way moved to stand. She didn't walk away from Star though, simply began the process of removing her armor. Either way, if Star talked or not, removing the armor would make the physical comfort. Ellesandra couldn't imagine snuggling your face up against a cold steel plate would be particularly comforting, after all.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly was. She talked a lot, expressed herself a lot, both physically and verbally. So it remained a departure from her normal self to be so quiet. She didn't stop them from pulling away, but whether Ellesandra felt it or not there was a lingering connection for a second or two as Ellesandra pulled away that let them feel how Star felt about it. Her heart crunched and even if she logically could tell Ellesandra was just getting out of their armor, the vulnerable woman's heart was crying out to Ellesandra: 'Please don't go'. Star just pulled her legs against her chest more fully, relying on herself for comfort while she waited for the knight beside her to change. The dented portion of Ellesandra's right arm armor might give them a bit of trouble, and would need to be repaired before they left again. Which said nothing about their actual arm underneath. Healed, yes, but the soreness was unlikely to play nice with the deeper, lasting injury. "...Why is it you accepted this duty of guarding me?" she asked, her voice mousy. "You mentioned something about it being because...That person in your dreams told you not to. Was it just...To spite them, or something?" Of course, Star was likely way off, but the other emotions in her heart were leading to dangerous assumptions and conclusions. Things that were quietly sitting in her heart and torturing her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra winced at the feel of pain at Ellesandra pulling away. A glance was given to Star, but then she just continued removing her armor. Her right arm and armor was definitely injured still and dented, but Ellesandra didn't bother trying to remove the gauntlet on her right arm right now. It was dented and would require some time to work off, which was very much not a priority. What she did do was get the plate removed and her left gauntlet, as well as her armored skirt so that she was down to her leggings and basic cloth jerkin that was tucked into said leggings. Moving back over to the bed, she didn't answer until she had sat back down next to Star. "Not to spite them." There was a hesitation at how much to share here. It was hard to share the real reason without giving a lot of information about her past. But, really, Star already knew some of it. So taking a deep breath, she reached back out to pull Star back in again, pulling them so that Star could choose to either just hug close into Ellesandra, or go down into a full on cuddle. Ellesandra would leave that up to Star, focused on not focusing on her emotions while trying to get rid of that fear and insecurity. "I won't let someone die if I can protect them." She said, finally. It wasn't the full truth, but it hinted at it. "It was my belief that leaving you alone, something would happen to you. And that would be on me, for knowingly walking away when I had been warned that you'd be attacked if you continued your journey. I...won't let someone die when I have the opportunity to stop it." Not again. It may not have been Star dying FOR her, but she still refused to just let Star die because she didn't travel with her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  If Star was given the option of a close physical position with someone she was close with, she was going to take that. It took little to earn her desire to hug. Though, to earn the closeness that Ellesandra had in her heart took much more. But it had been earned, and it meant that Star would, as much as allowed, cuddle up with Ellesandra. The answer was met with a little silence as she processed it, and what it meant. It was something that already happened, she knew that much. She also knew that pressing Ellesandra was likely to upset them, and she didn't want to do that. But it also wasn't sure it was the answer she wanted. The negative storm of emotions was still there after all. Still...It was noble. And that was comforting. Part of her wanted to tell Ellesandra they weren't obligated to walk this path with her. But she knew that Ellesandra knew that - they had been ambiguous enough about their desire to stay in the first place enough to make that clear. This all evolved from a simple escort back to the city, now ballooned into so much more. An angry flare rose in her heart, a spiteful desire to stubbornly rub the lack of obligation in Ellesandra's face in the way her heart, in the moment, felt Ellesandra constantly did to her when it came to her powers and everything surrounding them. But then that anger died, squashed by a wave of emotion that was more core to Star: Care. Kindness. Gentleness. And when the anger died, it left a wake of shame and apologetic grief. She hadn't even said anything to Ellesandra, yet she still felt the guilt as if she had. "It...Wouldn't be on you. I've known since the day it happened that I might meet my peril. I...Don't want to. I really don't. And it's been so comforting to have you here to help me through this." She paused, considering her words carefully. "I'm...Growing into a different person with you. I've always placed the wellbeing of others above myself, I'm...Sure you've noticed. But that's been largely because I never had someone I felt I could rely on like I can you. So it's been...Confusing, and scary when I sit with some of these emotions I feel. And some of the things you've said have struck me deeply in my heart. Made me...Worried that you'll one day soon decide you dislike me so much that you'll cease caring about what happens to me. So whenever I look at you and see...Annoyance, or discomfort, or disapproval, I just get...Scared..."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra pulled down onto the bed and let Star nestle into her. Her hold was tight enough that Star would feel the pressure, just enough she'd remember that she was being held close and was safe, but not so tight as to cause any discomfort. She was also careful not to make her hold too loose, to make Star think she wanted to get away or didn't want to be here. There was a bit of a spark in the center of her chest, her own desire for this type of closeness that was coming up at her actively offering it to Star. The memory of how she'd woken that morning, curled up against Star, and how much she had wanted to curl up against star consciously - though she wanted to not want that and didn't admit it to herself at all. As Star spoke, she looked up at the ceiling and let out a slow, deep breath that bordered on a sigh. The bad thing about encouraging Star to talk about these things, was that it necessitated a response from Ellesandra. She was slow in providing one, taking time to process and think, to weigh her words and try to identify which ones would be the honest truth phrased in a way that would be the most reassuring and comforting. This didn't come natural, so it took some time to consider, the entire time her hand had begun idly rubbing up and down Star's back gently. "Star, my desire to protect you isn't...isn't just because I feel like I would be responsible if I walked away and you died. Which is true, I would feel that way, but I know you'd argue that." There was hesitation. A rawness rose in her at the words that caught in her throat, the grief bubbled up. It was pushed back down, adamant that this conversation and emotional hold wouldn't somehow turn back around to focus on Ellesandra instead, but that didn't stop the words she spoke next from coming out in a choked whisper. "I walked away before. I let my charge do what she thought best. Stubborn like you, to do it with or without me. I thought me walking away would make her think twice, to not do it." She swallowed, more like a gulp as it pushed past a knot in her throat. "I wouldn't do that again, Star. If me being with you will protect you in this journey, then I'm with you." There was more. There was always more, but not only did Ellesandra not feel comfortable sharing or talking about it, actively not wanting to do so and wanting to keep all of that shoved down, but she also wanted to ensure this focused on reassuring Star. Not on Star turning around and reassuring Ellesandra, who would 100% break down after the shit today already if she went that route. "I won't leave you because you annoy me, Star. You're a good person." This was emphasized with a light squeeze, even if said squeeze resulted in a flinch at the raw and sore arm and rib. "I'll call you out on it when I think you overshare with your power, but that's what companions do, right? Make eachother better by letting the other know when they mess up. And I get why you do. It's...natural to you, to see that. It doesn't seem like an invasion, I'm sure. And to some it might not be."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star listened, quiet and fighting back the tears. Truly, with this comforting cuddle, it was easy enough to fight back those worries, those woes. All the rising negativity was intercepted before it could boil over in her heart. Calm found her, rather than tears. A profound effect that Ellesandra was coming to have on Star. A closeness that grew each day. Star envisioned herself in the situation Ellesandra described, and though she wouldn't say it, as she could tell it was a touchy subject, she couldn't disagree. Yes, she would do the same thing. Ellesandra threatening to walk away wouldn't stop her from doing something she thought was important. It wouldn't stop her from finding her mother. So she just gently nodded to those words. There was a pang of sorrow in her heart at being told she annoyed Ellesandra. Perhaps it was meant as a hypothetical future annoyance, but in the moment her vulnerable heart took it as belief that she presently annoyed Ellesandra, and it was enough to make her tremble lightly in the tight hold that was given. Another nod followed. Some it was an invasion upon was certainly Ellesandra, once more reminding her how much it bothered them. It wasn't said, which lessened the blow, but Ellesandra had never been shy about implications. The blunt 'the latter' rang in her mind. She remained quiet for a moment after all that. "My mother always told me to see my gift as a beautiful thing but...Sometimes I can't help but feel like it's a curse instead." 'Sometimes' being whenever she saw that rejection from Ellesandra, naturally.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet again after Star called her magic a curse. Or well, implied it felt like that sometimes. There were mixed emotions there, some of her wanting to agree and another part of her wanting to tell Star she was wrong. If Ellesandra had that power, she would hate it. She might even go so far as to walk around blindfolded or with her eyes closed, in completely transparent honesty. Then again, if she had that power, maybe she would be more comfortable with emotions than she was now, and so that idea of how she'd feel was biased and incorrect. Either way, she took a deep breath and looked down at Star. It was odd, holding Star this way that Ellesandra was looking down on her; she wasn't used to looking down on anyone with her short height. "Star, I don't know that curse is right for you. Your magic...fits you." She paused, then looked back up. There was frustration with herself, at not being able to easily find the right words to express her thoughts. She always spoke more with actions than words, but there weren't really actions right now that would explain this. "It's like mine. My body rejects arcane and divine magic. I'm not sure why it doesn't effect other magic, like your auramancy or my own physical based magic, but it refuses it either way. The most I've been able to get is instead of refusing it, to be able to absorb it - which is a great skill to have, but not exactly helpful when I need divine or arcane healing." There was a pause as she tried to refocus on what she was trying to say, lips pushing to the side in thought. One hand pulled away from Star lightly to pull her ponytail out, it being uncomfortable laying like this, and letting her hair fall down her back naturally instead. The hand was quickly returned to wrapping around Star, careful to not truly let go of her entirely. "I'm guarded. I don't let things in. I've always been that way, even as a child. My magic fit the way I approach life. Yours fits the way you do, too. While I'm guarded and don't let things in, you're the exact opposite. You let EVERYTHING in. And you embrace it all, and others. You can use your power for extraordinary things; even if I didn't believe that myself, I was all but told that but two different deity-like beings on opposite sides of their own little war. It has a bad side effect that you can't control, but that doesn't really make it a curse to you. Or you a bad person for having it, either." It would still be a curse if Ellesandra was the one who possessed the power, but that had already been covered.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star took time to digest Ellesandra's words. Magic being a reflection of self was something that was particularly true for her and her family. By nature of how she could see emotion, she had become a more emotionally in-tune person. She was naturally empathetic, as well as magically. It had fostered in her a love of all life, of all living things. Even without her mother raising her on a diet that was largely vegetarian, she would have come to that result regardless just by the consequence of her magic; likely it was true of all of her family, eating meat as a necessity rather than indulgence. It made her an affectionate person. A trusting person, unless she saw reason not to be. For when she could simply see if someone was hiding something, even if she didn't know what, it was easy to trust. It was easy to be a judge of character, when one's character was plainly on display for her. How she couldn't be bothered by an attitude like Amelia's because she could see how the anxieties bubbled just beneath that defensive posture, how she could piece together that it was likely Amelia grew up with harsh expectations and less than kind social circles that hardened her despite the clear desire to be recognized and acknowledged burning so brightly. Just as it gave her so many boons, however, it came with its own drawbacks. Her capacity for strictly offensive magics had always been troublesome. She could manage minor effects on this front, but her magic naturally attuned to supporting others. It was only in times where someone she cared about was in peril that she felt the swell of magic that could be used for direct harm burn inside her. Ellesandra's words had her pensive about all this, and ultimately coming to the conclusion that had her nodding gently against the other woman. "I want to do extraordinary things," she said gently. "I want to save others from tragedy. I want to mend wounds that others cannot. I want to bring smiles to everyone I meet," she said, then pulled her head out from under Ellesandra's chin to look them in the eyes. A look that specifically focused those words just spoken unto Ellesandra directly. She wanted to make THEM smile. "It hurts...When I falter. My heart cannot bear being a source of pain in others. Least of all those closest to me..." Her lips trembled, here. A bubbling of something she was internally warring with herself about. But ultimately, she said it: "Least of all...You."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra held Star, letting her take all the time she needed. Her hand continued to rub up and down on star's back lightly, reassuringly, comforting. When Star nodded against her, she turned her eyes down from where they had been focused - or really, intentionally unfocused gazing without seeing anything above to intentionally avoid looking too closely at the emotions she felt and saw within Star when they touched - to look at her again. The words - 'I want to do extraordinary things' hit her with a bitter sweet memory, one of her as a child saying the exact same things to Sia. The child-like innocence and naivety, that she alone would be able to save the world, save multiple people, make literally everyone she met have a better life because of it. Yet as Star continued, her eyes dipped to those lips, trembling. Star, if she was paying attention, would see a flash of a desire, one which was quickly stamped out and refocused on the situation. Even if she might be attracted to Star, Ellesandra wouldn't let desire like that fester. She might want to comfort with a kiss, but that was not right for their relationship - friendship or just client-charge relationship. Ellesandra was not emotionally available, and Star wouldn't be happy with anything less, Ellesandra guessed. So, she focused on what Star was saying instead. "You can't go through life without hurting people, Star. Maybe without hurting them intentionally, but unintentionally? The only way I can imagine doing that is if you just don't interact with anyone for the rest of your life." Ellesandra was choosing words carefully, trying to gauge how to say things. Her mind went back to when she'd said similar words to Sia, and an idea popped into her mind. She hesitated, caution and a bit of uncertainty creeping up before she looked down to Star. "May I share a...memory with you?" Ellesandra was afraid of saying things wrong, of making Star upset, but she trusted her mentor to have said them better. While she was bad at words, wasn't a leader or inspiring or able to scold someone for being naive without it coming off harsh, Sia was able to.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a soft smile at the notion of not being able to hurt people unintentionally unless she just became an antisocial hermit. She wouldn't be able to bear such a life. She needed to be around people. She also saw the brief moment of desire. Something that evoked a blush. Even as it was pushed down, there was a spark that flashed in her own heart, in her chest. She didn't draw attention to it, but she still wore her heart on her sleeve, so Ellesandra would be able to see the way that desire was reciprocated. The two were close, cuddling, with mutual attraction simmering just below the surface. She was feeling vulnerable. But she took Ellesandra's lead; they pushed it down, and she...Didn't push it down, but she did allow those butterflies to live in her heart, flutter, then settle. Now wasn't the time, but she still allowed herself to feel it, as with all her feelings. The offer to have a memory shared evoked a slightly eager nod. "O-Of course, Ellesandra. Always. You don't even need to ask...Even if I know you will," she said with a smile. There was nothing at all wrong with asking, and Star certainly would as well. But she needed to say it so strongly, for she needed to make it clear that she would never, ever, ever deny Ellesandra if they wanted to be open with her about anything. "Just...Open yourself to me and focus on the memory. My heart will listen to whatever you wish to share."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra saw the blush, but she still wasn't letting herself focus too much on the emotions that she felt from Star, so the actual desire wasn't noticed. It was guessed at, considering the blush, but again that knowledge was ignored instead of focused on - though this being because she didn't want to entertain the idea of indulging in that desire, rather than respect for Star's privacy. When given the confirmation that she could share a memory, Ellesandra closed her eyes and did her best to try to 'open herself' to Star. This wasn't easy; even if Star could see right past her normal guards and walls, they still existed. Removing them wasn't something Ellesandra had any practice in, and the idea of opening herself to Star to let her see the memory was...scary. There was fear, trepidation circling within her as she tried, trying to be careful and cautious not to share more than exactly what she was intending to share. It took a few minutes for her to be able to open herself up enough to push the memory through their auras and their bond. When she did, Star would find herself watching a much younger Ellesandra in mid-spar with who could only be Sia. Ellesandra looked to be in her preteens, about 11 or 12. She was already at her full height of 5'1, having hit her growth spurt early an then just...never hitting another one. Yet, her body was still that of a child, not grown. She didn't have the wider shoulders, she had less muscle, and her form was more wirey than it was strong. Her hair wasn't nearly as long - and in fact looked like it had recently been cut in a way that mirrored Sia's in front of her, though it had been growing out a bit. The left side had obviously been cut extremely short while the rest had been left at a bit longer of a length, to match Sia's sidebuzz and short hair, but Ellesandra had been growing it back out. It made for an uneven grow out, but once the left side was long enough to be decent she'd cut the rest of her hair to match even with it again. They were in the center of an obvious training ground, though right now the only people actively using it were Ellesandra and Sia. There was a castle in the backround, the ground situated far enough away the sound of training wouldn't disturb those within it but a few minute walk and still within the walls of the castle. There were people far off on the other side using targets to practice archery, and the tell tale sign of servants walking around going about their tasks. Ellesandra was in leather training pads, with a dull training longsword in her right hand and a wooden buckler in her left. Sia across from her was using matching weapons, towering over Ellesandra at a height of 6'1, and looked to be in her mid to late thirties at this point. During this memory, her own hair was all black, unlike the salt and pepper it had been in Ellesandra's dream from when Ellesandra was older. Her face was hard, and it didn't take an expert to see that she was pushing Ellesandra, easily deflecting blows and striking back. It was a punishment bout, for Ellesandra being late to training. A reminder just how much better Sia was than Ellesandra, and why she needed to focus on her training. Sia was using a similarly dull weapon, but that didn't stop it from bruising and hurting each time it struck Ellesandra's arm or ribs - yet it was always held back from doing real damage. Sia would never hit hard enough to break bone, to cause any real harm or damage, but just hard enough to hurt and remind Ellesandra her guard had been down. Ellesandra, despite this being a punishment bout and already covered in bruises, was having fun. There was joy all in her emotions, more than Star ever would have seen in real time Ellesandra. Sparring like these, even if it hurt, was exhilarating. There was some frustration at how much she kept getting hit, the mistakes she was making, but there was also appreciation for them being shown, and a determination not to make them again. The memory also started near the end of the fight, and Ellesandra had already been winded and tired, working to control her breathing but obviously being pushed to her limits. It wasn't until she faltered on a step forward, her leg giving beneath her from the exhaustion of the fight that Sia pulled up to stop them. Ellesandra kneeled in front of her, hands splayed out on the ground and breathing heavily while trying to recover, and Sia looking down at her with a stoic face that was very reminiscent of how Ellesandra wore her face most of the time now. "Up, El. You lasted ten minutes this time, that's an improvement from last week." Ellesandra struggled back up, muscles still obviously exhausted and still breathing heavily to recover from the exertion. Her legs shook and her head hung low, but not because of shame - just relaxing and letting her neck muscles rest. "Th...thank..you...ma'am." She said between deep breaths. She winced as she raised her arm, bruising on her upper arm making itself known from one of Sia's blows to it. "I'll send word to the servants to have a cold bath prepared for you tonight to help with the blows." Sia was stoic, but Star would be able to see that there was affection in her emotions. And disappointment at Ellesandra having been late. Sia may have never said it to Ellesandra, and Ellesandra was too bad with people to tell, but Sia had considered Ellesandra like a daughter - even when she was this young. "Thank...thank you, Ma'am." Ellesandra repeated, looking over at one of the stumps aligned along the outside of the training circle and moving to sit on it for a moment, giving her legs a rest. They would need it, after that bout. Sia followed, sitting beside Ellesandra. "You know better than to be late to training, El. What was so important that held you up? It's not like you." Ellesandra let out a huff and a smirk, feeling a bit sheepish but not ashamed at all for being late this time. "Carrie...the - the young bakers girl...you know them?" Sia nodded, frowning. "Carrie made you late?" Ellesandra shook her head quickly, still working to speak through the heavy breathing. "No No - I chose to be late, wasn't...wasn't her fault. She had climbed up the...the big tree next to the castle, you know the -" Ellesandra didn't finish that, just pointed in the direction of the castle, towards the right side. Sia nodded. "She was scared to get down. I went up...helped her down." There was a mixture of pride and disappointment in Sia now, though the only thing that shown through was a frown. "You chose to do something that you could have easily asked a number of the servants to do, that would make you late to your training?" Ellesandra nodded, still sheepish. "She...she knows me, Ma'am. Less likely for her to....to panic and fall than some...some servant helping her. She's only...five...that might really...hurt for her." Sia pursed her lips, again much of the same way Star would have seen Ellesandra do so. "You know you can't help everyone yourself, Ellesandra." Ellesandra shook her head, looking up finally to meet Sia's eyes and giving her a cocky smirk. "I'm going to...to do extraordinary things, ma'am. I'll...I'll save the Kingdom. I don't....don't care if it's an ancient dragon attacking, it will fall at my sword...ma'am." The youthful innocence, combined with arrogance. For an eleven year old, Ellesandra truly was skilled, but her dreams were still that of a child. Imagining herself on the walls, fighting off a dragon and single handedly saving the world. Sia pursed her lips, shaking her head. "No, Ellesandra. That's foolish. If you spend your life trying to save and help everyone, you'll never be able to do so. You have limits, and it is important that you recognize them, or you'll find yourself in an early, foolish grave." Ellesandra shook her head. "But I have...have to try, Ma'am! If I don't, then if something bad...bad happens to them, it's my fault!" Sia leaned down, getting to eye level with Ellesandra. "No, it is not. You always give what you can, I'm not saying walk away, but it is impossible to please or help everyone. Trying to do so is only going to cause you to hurt others instead. If you can't give yourself fully to a cause, you won't be able to complete it and that will make it less effective, waste time. You can't help people out on both sides of the conflict and come away the victor for either side. You will fail at helping people. People will die under your watch Ellesandra, no matter how good a guard you are." Young Ellesandra seemed taken aback by how serious and insistent Sia was. She blinked, frowning and shaking her head. "No, Ma'am I - I can-" "No, you can't Ellesandra. You will burn yourself out trying. It is good that you helped Carrie, but you will need to learn to balance your priorities better going forward. Stopping to help someone may very well mean your initial mission is failed. You must be prepared for those types of consequences in the real world. And no matter how hard you try, you will upset people sometimes. It's the way of life, so learn how to deal with upsetting them instead of pretending you didn't." Ellesandra looked...dismayed, and upset by what Sia was saying. She didn't like having those dreams entirely shot down, still holding onto the belief that she could make a difference if she tried. That the others who couldn't, just didn't try hard enough or weren't good enough. She was distracted, however, from a young girl's voice calling from the background. A soft, singsong voice that immediately elicited a blush from the young Ellesandra. "Ellie! Are you done yet? Aunt Sia tell me you didn't wear her out again?!" Before the memory could actually move to where the voice was, though, Ellesandra ended it. Her guards snapped back into place and she looked away from Star, up into the ceiling of the room. It wasn't hard to tell though - the voice at the end had stirred up the grief and guilt that totally wasn't there in her. Enough that Ellesandra was clenching her jaw hard to help fight it back.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star helped guide Ellesandra through the process. It wasn't a simple thing to open one's self; it was akin to flexing a muscle on a limb that almost everyone had no idea they even had. As with magic, most didn't grasp it until the intrinsic feeling was shown to them, either by a mentor or by some event that triggered it. Ellesandra would find their grasp of their own aura weak and loose, as if reaching up at the moon to try and palm it. It was miles away. But with Star there, her influence created a bridge that allowed Ellesandra to step across the seemingly infinite void with ease and reach into themselves to produce the desired memory. Guiding the memory was as simple as remembering it, something that proved easily done when focusing on the emotions that triggered the memory. The affection for Sia, the source of the point trying to be conveyed, whatever it was that spoke to Ellesandra was the fuel that allowed the memory to burn brightly in their aura and be felt and relived. Star felt the physical pain in herself; transitive and temporary, it was simply part of the memory to her. She knew it was not her own pain, and was not actually hurt by it. But the ragged breaths, the soreness in Ellesandra, was all part of reliving the memory. As well, feeling the maternal emotions Sia had for Ellesandra was comforting, even if the woman was a rugged and at times, clearly, harsh mentor. It explained a lot about Ellesandra to Star. From the mannerisms she saw mirrored, to the no-nonsense attitude and harsh realities that guided them. It also explained why Ellesandra had been so stern with Star initially. Ellesandra saw a naiive spirit in Star, a woman who acted more on whimsy and idealism than thoughtful planning and strategy. The truth was that Star was a mix of both, a woman who Sia would absolutely come down upon like a ton of bricks if they were her mentor, but not a woman without her own talents either. Before meeting Ellesandra, Star was more liberal with taking risks. She thought on her feet, and that combined with her powers made her capable of navigating perilous situations. She was an intelligent woman. But there was a grain of wisdom to this chosen memory being shown to Star, for it was true. She couldn't help everyone. She regularly pushed herself to her limits, sometimes beyond them. But to Star, the answer was not to accept her limitations. The answer was to transcend them. Become stronger, so she could do more. Yet even in that truth that was core to Star, there was truth in that if Star did not focus, if she gave everything she had to everyone else, she would have nothing left to achieve her goal. To save her mother, when life had already taken her other mother away from her permanently. She could stop it from happening again, she did truly believe. But not if she stopped to help everyone stuck in a tree and let those distractions keep her from her goal. That was the message she interpreted from Ellesandra, through this memory of Sia. It was a truth she already acknowledged before this moment, but this memory helped to cement it. Even with that, however...Star had seen how powerful her own mother was. The same blood, the same magic, coursed through her veins. Temperance of herself was still necessary. She still needed to ensure she did not burn herself out. She had to accept that pursuing her goal was more important than some things. She still would have done what she did for Lissana a thousand times over, but it refocused her on a singular test: Is whatever she was trying to do worth her mother's life? Because truly, it might be a decision she would have to make. A thoughtful, contemplative energy suffused Star as the memory faded. A lot of things to digest, and an instinct for her to speak all about how much Sia's adoration warmed her heart...But that instinct was quashed. If Ellesandra was uncomfortable with Star sharing emotions that Amelia felt, she might very well consider sharing Sia's emotions a slap in the face. That, combined with the ending of the memory...Ellesandra certainly didn't seem to intend on that part being included, but the guilt, the grief, it was emotion that Star was able to link to, of all things, the handkerchief Ellesandra carried. The voice, the emotion, the confession that Ellesandra had let someone die and the specific word choice by Sia about Ellesandra being a guard...It clicked a few things into place. But Star didn't wish to come out of the gate with that. First, and foremost, she opened her eyes again after having closed them while embracing that memory and looked at Ellesandra deep in their eyes, waiting for their grief and guilt to subside if needed for them to look back and see her smiling. "...Thank you, Ellesandra. For sharing that. I...Need you to know that that means a lot to me. I don't take such things lightly, ever, but...It's particularly meaningful coming from you. You said yourself how guarded you are so...That trust means a great deal to me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took her time, forcing down those emotions again. She was silently thankful that Star gave her that time, knowing Star probably wanted her to talk about it, ask who that voice was, or encourage Ellesandra to share what happened. It was also good that Star hadnt mentioned what she had seen in Sia; that would have caused Ellesandra to entirely retreat. After practicing some deep breaths, she looked back down to see Star just...smiling at her. Then thanking her. She was a bit uncomfortable with the thanks, shrugging it off. "She said it better than I can. You can't...just never upset someone, Star. I'm sure you'll upset me again before this journey is through, knowing how prickly I can be." She paused, then shrugged again. "Control what you can, accept and handle what you can't. Make it better when it happens, that's all you can do."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gave a warm smile at the response and shook her head. She then moved a hand up to extend just an index finger and place it gently on the tip of Ellesandra's nose. "Not for that, silly," she said, voice gentle and quiet. "That, too, yes, but...I mean for sharing with me, for being open with me. And I...I know what you say is true," she said, retreating her hand again to rest on Ellesandra's shoulder. "I'm not saying I'm not going to upset you. I'm just saying...When it happens, I'm going to feel bad. I think it's...Important. Remorse is important. I'd never upset you intentionally, and if I wasn't upset by unintentionally doing so, then, well...It would mean I didn't really care that you were upset, or I didn't believe you were right to be upset, or...Something. The pit in my heart that twists and aches when I see the pain in you it's...Hard to bear. But I would rather feel it, than not. And it's important to me that when it happens, more than just make it better however I can, you know how it affects me. Not just assumed, not just...Said. Seen. You can't see my emotions unless you touch me and focus on what I feel, or when we touch and it just...Spills over and gets messy and..." She shook her head, she was getting off track. "The point is, Ellesandra...I can know in my head that my mistakes are mistakes, but I can't let myself be absolved of the pain, the remorse, of them just because it's inevitable. I cannot be so jaded or cynical. Those feelings...I've felt them before, of course. But among all the feelings I've ever had, those ones...The ones that push me towards indifference or minimizing how others feel...They make me feel the most disgusted with myself. So just...If you see me sad because I see that I've made you feel bad in some way, just understand that it's my way of trying to be better. I know I can't never upset people...But I can make sure every time it does that it's seen, more than just passively understood, that I didn't mean it."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She again shrugged off the implied thanks. It made her uncomfortable, thinking about it or being the focus of appreciation, so she ignored that and focused on what else Star was sharing. The idea of feeling remorse was obviously not new to Ellesandra, but the difference between the two is Star felt things so strongly. Ellesandra felt remorse for things in the past, guilt for hurting Star or saying something that upset her, but there was a difference between letting it effect you as much as Star did, and just feeling that and trying to learn from it going forward. In a way, it was an action versus words situation. "Just because you feel remorse now doesn't mean you'll actually avoid doing the thing again in the future. The best way to make it up is to fix or avoid doing it again, showing remorse is just..." She shrugged. This was just Ellesandra's opinion though, very action oriented. Things didn't matter unless you backed them up with action. Just because you said you were sorry or actually felt, didn't mean you'd take the effort to make it better or prevent it. It was a moment before she added - "That's for me, at least. I'm aware that others are appeased by such shows, so I guess I can't blame you for expressing it as you do." She leaned her head back onto the bed, closing her eyes. The hand that had been rubbing Star's back moved up and lightly began petting through her long hair, a gesture that was entirely unconscious and not realized that she was even doing. Just a soothing, comforting, almost cuddling like gesture, more than just making Star feel better.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly appreciated the hand through her hair. It evoked the faintest blush, but she didn't fight it or even draw attention to it otherwise. "There's a difference between remorse and just...Aimless guilt. When you feel genuine remorse for something, it is a driver of change. It's why I can tell you that there are things even just from the moment I saw the discomfort in you at what I shared earlier today and now that I wanted to share but...Didn't. And won't. It's why I've eased back when it comes time to fight, instead of trying to get involved...Because I know how deeply the fear in you runs that something would happen to me, something you'd feel was your fault. I can't promise that danger will always elude me but...I can remember the pain I saw in you when you admitted what happened and why it hurts you so, and I can remember the remorse I felt in having let my own angers and frustrations blind me to what you felt until the emotion boiled over in you. Remorse without genuine change isn't meaningful, I'm sure you agree. It's not about appeasing anyone though. It's about honesty, to me. To me if...Someone hurt me, but didn't feel any remorse for it, well...It just signals to me that they weren't affected by the weight of their actions, if that makes sense." She paused here, gently shaking her head as she felt herself going off track again, and pushed a little closer to Ellesandra, happy as could be to bask in the warm, affectionate gestures as she tucked her head under their chin again. "What I'm saying is it's...My way of telling you I'm sorry, and that I'm going to be better. And I will be. Even if I'm not perfect, I feel I've already come a long way to better understanding you. And that's important to me. You're important to me."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was quiet, eyes closed while running her fingers mindlessly through Star's hair, listening. The reminder of that night she'd broken down caused discomfort and a pre-emptive barrier between herself and that nonexistent mountain, not wanting a repeat of that night. The explanation made sense, as to why Star had stayed back and not done much against the armored knight - though causing it to slip before it could impale Ellesandra certainly wasn't nothing. She shook her head finally, speaking. "First, I don't want you to just...not participate in a fight, if it's needed. I just want you to prioritize your safety. Don't do something foolish like rush into a physical fight or step in front of a blow for me. Stay back and use defensive magic, if you participate. That or get yourself out of there. Just standing to the sideline doing nothing is....well, I guess it's not productive." A soft shrug, and that's when she seemed to realize where her hand was. It froze, stopping the petting, and then slowly lowered back down to Star's back. There was a mixture of shame, desire, and guilt in response to the realization. Shame at potentially taking advantage of the closeness for her own need of touch, desire for - well, obvious reasons - and guilt that she might be unintentionally leading Star on. She took a deep breath, refocusing herself on the topic. "And it's not me you have to apologize to, in that situation. Your magic makes me uncomfortable not because of the information you share with me, but it's lack of consent from the other person, Star. If someone consents for you to analyze and share the emotions they have in their aura that's one thing, and would be fine. But the fact that your magic doesn't require consent for something that is so personal - that's what makes me uncomfortable. And I know" She rushed to add, wanting to make sure Star didn't get down about the general state of her magic again and think it was a curse. "That you can't control that, and that's not your fault. You CAN control whether you share that information with or without the person's consent, though." There was a pause, and then she added, as if for explanation. "If you told anyone about that mountain which doesn't exist, I'd be really upset at you. It's a...more extreme case than what you shared earlier, but the same idea."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was a little sad about the lost hair petting. She saw the shame and guilt and desire mixed together. She contemplated asking them to keep going but...She similarly didn't want to cause them undue grief or complicate things. She liked feeling close to Ellesandra, she liked feeling pretty, she liked a lot of things...But she didn't want to push inwards and make Ellesandra retreat. Instead, once Ellesandra had finished talking, and only when they had finished, did she move a hand up to gently place the tips of her index and middle finger on Ellesandra's lips. A tender, gentle touch that allowed Ellesandra to feel the silky softness of her skin upon their lips, but more was intended to be a playful hushing gesture. "I understand it all, Ellesandra. I understand. I had my reasons and wanted only to prevent a greater harm, but you, and a little dose of hindsight, were all I needed to set me straight." She lowered her fingers here, back to begin towards Ellesandra's shoulder, only to pause and instead move around to brush her fingers through Ellesandra's hair, much how they had been earlier. A silent assurance that that gesture was okay. She could see Ellesandra's need, of course. The void of physical affection. And she similarly wasn't making amorous advances with this...Just gently doing it to give a little comfort. "I'm looking out for myself. Finding the balance between helping you and not drawing undue attention to myself. I know I can do a lot more...But this change in my stance is only because of the things you've told me, and the things I've seen. I'm still finding the balance, but I just wanted to convey to you that I have a desire to be a lot more involved, but I hold back because I am doing what you say. My safety over yours, even with how much it tears my heart apart to see you in such peril. Because I'd rather see you with bloody wounds I can mend than tearing open the wound, the fears, in your heart that history will repeat itself." She smiled, and paused before deciding to take a bold leap: "...It's her handkerchief you carry around, right? I'm not going to pressure you to talk about it, before you tense up...I just had my suspicions. It's why I couldn't bring myself to, you know...Use it. I'm sentimental to a fault like that, I guess."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra froze up when Star touched her lips. Just the playful shushing, but the feel of her finger across her lips...it did things to her. Star would easily be able to see the desire, not just in her emotions, but how she opened her eyes and looked down at star. Her pupils had dilated and there was the temptation to pull Star closer, to slide fingers against skin rather than just her back over clothes, to feel Star's lips against hers and more skin than just that of her finger. The thing was, it was really hard to hide an attraction from someone who could literally see it in your aura, so Ellesandra didn't try to hide it. She did, however, close her eyes after the brief moment of surprise and feeling of it, to break the spell and turn her head away. A desire felt, but not followed up on. And then Star began running her fingers through Ellesandra's hair, and despite simply trying to assure her, that made her tense up more. It was easy to see the need for such physical comfort, the type of comfort she hadn't had in a long time. Not just sex, but to actually be held and cared for. She'd never had that type of thing with a mother, and hadn't even really had it with Marigold, either. She'd had a few flings she'd allow to cuddle with before the incident, but nothing where it was more than just the physical comfort after sex - at least not on Ellesandra's side. She didn't pull away from the touch, but she also wasn't entirely able to enjoy it with the conflicting emotions going on. And then, on top of that, Star brought the handkerchief. The rawness of the grief that sprang out was enough to cause Ellesandra to move out of the bed, disentangling herself from Star's touch entirely and moving over to her pack on the other side of the room, back to Star. It had been immediate, the comment about the handkerchief and how the grief had hit her. The guilt came in next, but it was less right now. Less, because the grief of hearing her voice in that memory, something she'd almost forgotten happened, and how the memory had ended - even if Star didn't get to see that part. That, on top of how emotionally exhausted she'd been from her tussle with the memories the magical armor had shown her, and Ellesandra didn't have the emotional fortitude to keep fighting it all back. She needed to separate from it; unlike Star, she wasn't practiced at having a lot of emotions and dealing with them constantly. "I'm going to take a shower. Sweaty after that fight." It wasn't an answer, and in fact it was Ellesandra withdrawing again, but the lack of an answer was at least a confirmation for Star. The handkerchief was that of the person she'd failed. It was the only physical memento left of her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star expected it might be possible that Ellesandra would retreat like this. She respected that the other woman needed that space, and to take things at their own pace. She couldn't force it all at once. To bear all that emotion at once would kill Ellesandra. Would kill anyone. So she let them go, while keeping in mind the desire Ellesandra felt for her. It wasn't...Something she disliked. Even if a comment rang in her mind, 'I would be more comfortable fucking you than cuddling with you'...It hit her heart like an injection of sour, bitter poison. But she could disentangle that, all of that, from what she saw in Ellesandra. The need. The vulnerability. Just because Ellesandra would be more comfortable didn't mean it was the whole story. So rather than get bitter and upset about it all, she quietly moved up out of the bed to follow Ellesandra. She moved up behind them when they paused and slid her arms around their middle, hands smoothing over their abdomen over their jerkin. Her forehead came to rest on the back of Ellesandra's head for a moment. And she just...Held that for a moment. A gentle squeeze then followed before she slowly released and pulled back. If Ellesandra looked at her, Star was wearing a sympathetic smile. A smile that showed understanding that they needed some space to recover, and that that was okay. "Take your time. We all need time to relax in a nice hot shower, right?" That was absolutely not about the shower, but she'd let Ellesandra pretend it was.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She hadn't expected Star to get up and come give her a hug. She stiffened as she felt Star's arms slide around her middle and tighten. Ellesandra stood frozen, unsure what to do or how to handle this. On the one hand, it made her extremely uncomfortable. She didn't know what to do, and part of her wanted to step away from Star. To keep that distance, since that was what she felt like she needed. But at the same time, part of her wanted to relax into the hold. To just let Star hold her, and make the grief okay. To just let someone take care of her, for once. The desire to do that was there, but she didn't do it. She also didn't pull away, though. She just stood there, awkward until Star pulled back and released her. Her throat was tight and she couldn't verbalize a response, so she just nodded at what Star said before leaning back down to her pack and rifling through it to find a change of clothes before straightening. There was a glance given around, a safety habit to ensure leaving Star in the room alone wouldn't be a risk to her, before Ellesandra would go off for a hot shower, just like Star said. And she would take her time with it; she would let the scalding hot water give her something to focus on rather than the grief. To feel the physical pain over it, and only turn the heat down once she felt stable over it. Not that she'd ever tell Star that's what she was doing, knowing Star would get upset with her, but still.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly wouldn't find the coping mechanism to be a good one. And perhaps to Ellesandra's dismay, there was a knock on the door to the small attached restroom soon after Ellesandra started. "Ellesandra? Is everything okay? Are you in pain?" came the sound of Star's voice through the door. Ellesandra wasn't a dapper squirrel, but Star was also not a child anymore. Perhaps the first time she'd acted on it, but it also might prove to be the first time Ellesandra would have a concrete example of Star's ability to sense Ellesandra's emotions without direct line of sight, or being close by while sleeping. Star certainly explained it when they were talking about the desire to sleep close together when out in the wilds, but there was a good chance it was overlooked with the more pressing topic at hand.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ah fuck. There was immediate regret when she heard the knock and question. After a moment of hesitation, she'd turned the heat down a bit. Still enough to tinge, at least at the already reddened and raw skin, but not enough that it would be actively hurting. Best not give Star more reason to be worried about her - though now came the issue of how did she respond. Her head was pressed against the side of the shower and her eyes closed, letting wet hair hang down around her face. "I-" She started to respond, then stopped. Lying to Star would just be an insult, since she knew Star could tell it was a lie. It would probably also upset her, that she lied while knowing Star could tell. Instead, she spoke. It wasn't the full truth still, but would be enough to appease Star, she thought. "Hot water helps me process. Like - the memory you saw. The pain helps me focus on it. I'm fine." It wasn't entirely wrong. That was exactly where Ellesandra had learned that pain could help you learn. That being hit by Sia's training blade wasn't a punishment so much as it was a teaching opportunity - at least that's how Ellesandra saw it. Of course, many people would consider that abuse of some kind, but it never was to Ellesandra. And she'd taken that mindset with her into the future, in a not so great way. Self-harm was still self-harm, and wasn't actually a good coping mechanism.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a contemplative pause from Star after hearing Ellesandra's response. A combination of studying the response as well as the emotions surrounding it all that she could sense. She knew when she was being lied to. She also knew when someone was telling half the truth. Subtle cues in the emotional state made clear to her when something caused someone to hold something back. The baseline of someone speaking honestly provided the test to which other statements were contested to discern the falsities and omissions. And Star...Did not enjoy Ellesandra holding back on this, but she didn't much like how Ellesandra held back on...Most everything. Frustration flared in her heart, but...She knew that anger wasn't the answer. Ellesandra was in pain. These coping mechanisms weren't healthy, but Ellesandra wasn't just...whimsically harming themselves. It was borne instead of a lack of other methods to properly handle the emotion that burned in them. One pain to distract from another. Star understood the reason, the cause. But just because she understood it didn't mean she abided by it. This crossed a line for her. "...No, Ellesandra." She paused for a moment. "We're talking about this when you're done." Star was rarely so bold or forceful in her words or tone. Ellesandra had many times drawn hard lines for Star, and it was Star's turn to do the same. She could give Ellesandra space. She could bide her time with their emotional turmoil. She could even try not to take too personally some of the harsher things Ellesandra had said, for she understood the pains that caused Ellesandra to say them. But she could not, would not sit idle while Ellesandra practiced self harm. So Star sat on her bed, facing the shower door, legs crossed. She patiently waited for Ellesandra, expecting they might intentionally take a bit longer than usual in the shower in some effort to try and avoid the conversation, but Star was prepared to stay up all day and night to talk this out with her companion.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra felt....exasperation when Star told her no and that they were going to talk about this. She wasn't upset at Star - in reality, there was a very, very small bit that she wasn't acknowledging that appreciated and enjoyed the obvious show of caring Star was giving right now. But mostly, she felt exasperated that she was going to have to have a conversation on the way she coped with this. It almost made her want to turn the heat up more, to just distract herself from that while she was in the shower, but that would probably just make matters worse. Her hand hovered over the temperature dial, and then with a groan she turned it down just a little more and went about doing her actual shower routine of letting the water run through her hair, using some soap and such. It was about ten more minutes before Ellesandra came walking out of the shower, freshly clothed and with a towel wrapped around her wet hair for it to dry out. She wasn't looking at Star, a little bit of shame and trepidation at this conversation they were about to have, like a kid trying to get out of a punishment. She moved over to her pack, putting the dirty clothes back in there for now and then moving to take the bits of armor she hadn't removed earlier to place with the rest of her armor, near the beds. The good thing about threatening to make them talk about this when they got out was it gave them this conversation to focus on, rather than the grief that had been bubbling up before, so it had been a successful distraction technique.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star watched quietly as Ellesandra walked out of the shower and did their routine. She watched how their emotions shifted. One of the many problems that Star had come across when it came to dealing with Ellesandra and their emotional turmoils was just...Where to start? And when focusing on one thing, how to not get distracted by the thousand other things that came up. She had to bite her tongue on...A lot, if only in service of not overwhelming Ellesandra and doing more harm than good. But ultimately, she pat the bed beside her, though she was fairly certain Ellesandra would ignore that and just sit on their bed anyway. She still was going to offer the closeness. "...So, do you wanna tell me why you think scalding yourself is a good way to cope? And then trying to downplay it like I can't see right through that...It's one thing to enjoy a nice, relaxing, steamy shower. I know I love to take those, and they do help. It's another to cause yourself actual physical pain with it." Despite her needing to maintain a firm stance on this to avoid Ellesandra thinking they could just dismiss their way out of it, Star was still gentle and kind in her tone, as well as plenty worried and concerned. Ellesandra was a victim in this, after all. She wasn't out to make them feel bad for just trying to cope...She just needed to find a way to help them find a better way.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wanted to just walk out of the room, but she knew that wouldn't be productive. Not only would that be, in a way, abandoning Star in a strange city that surely had some dangers no matter what Amelia and Amara said, but she'd have to face Star later anyways, probably significantly more upset. Her eyes went to the door, and then finally over to the beds. Like Star expected, she took a seat on her own bed rather than next to Star. She also wasn't looking at Star, eyes cast down at her hands, lightly wringing in her lap. "I never claimed it was a 'good' idea." She muttered, then shrugged. "It works. And I never do enough to cause any permanent damage." Excuses, but they were also true. She paused for a moment, then added. "It gives me something else to focus on." And, unsaid but silently thought was that she deserved it. At least when it came to emotions regarding Marigold, it was cathartic in the way of feeling like she deserved that pain. Ellesandra cleared her throat at the thought and shook it out of her mind, hoping that Star didn't try to push for what that was.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's expression softened a little. "At least you recognize it for being harmful," she said quietly, more thinking aloud than anything. "And I'm sure it does work. As would imbibing a hundred steins of ale a night. Harm is harm though, Ellesandra. I don't believe for a single second that you would tolerate me doing the same, even if I sat her before you and said it helped me. I admit that there's been a lot I've wanted to say on the matter of you and your...Choice of coping mechanisms. I haven't been pushy there out of concern for you, for pushing too much too fast. I know it hurts, Ellesandra. Obviously I know. I see it. But I also know that I can't expect you, or anyone, to face it all at once. Emotional healing is a process. It takes time. But what DOESN'T help is what you're doing. I'm sure it feels like it does, and in the immediate it might. But I've called emotional pain poison before, and I will continue to call it that, because it is." She paused, her sympathetic gaze still fixed on Ellesandra. "...It makes you need stronger and stronger ways to distract from the pain as it continues to get more painful inside you. But I'm drawing the line here. I won't stand idle and watch you hurt yourself, just as I know for certain you wouldn't. I want to say much more. I want to talk about so...So much more. But I'm still biting my tongue, because there are things you need before you can deal with all that." The need for affection came to mind. The need for closeness, for physical comforts that she saw in them. "But this stops now. I know you'll still need something to help you through when those emotions get too overwhelming to face, of course...So...Let's talk about it. There are other, better ways to help focus. I'd sooner you find a training ground to stab a straw dummy thousand times with your rapier to focus on your fighting form than lay a single finger of harm upon yourself. I'm not saying I don't understand what's driven you to this point but...I am saying I will never abide by this way of coping. And I'd hope that, with us just coming off the heels of you sharing that memory of Sia with me in how sternly she spoke of looking out for your own limits, you'd understand that...Harming yourself runs very contrary to that, even putting aside the mountain of other reasons I can't let you do that sort of thing to yourself."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Well, Star was drawing a line in the sand. A line that Ellesandra wasn't sure it would be smart to cross. She took in a deep breath, trying to figure out how to respond. In reality, she should be able to just tell Star to fuck off, that this was her business, not Star's, and she could cope with it however she wanted to. On the other hand, that was a recipe for disaster with their working relationship. And she guessed doing this again would also be a similar recipe. "Too bad you can't just take feelings out and make them not exist." She mumbled, thinking that would be quite a hell of a thing an auramancer could do. Plenty of people would want that skill and pay well for it. She pressed her hands flat down onto her thighs for a moment, then stood up and moved to pace at the end of the room rather than sitting. The comment about Sia was a low blow, even if unintentional. It upset Ellesandra, that was obvious, but it wasn't that Ellesandra was upset at Star for it. It more just reminded her of the last time she'd seen Sia, already disappointed in her. "I don't think Sia would give a shit about what I do to cope now." She responded, then shook her head. "I'll try to find another way, Star." She pulled up short, and turned to face Star fully. "I won't promise anything. But I really don't want to talk about this more. We have...lots of information to go through here, we should get started on that."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "I wouldn't do that even if I could," she said firmly back to Ellesandra, suggesting she felt that ignoring or removing someone's emotions was a horrible thing to do. The comment about Sia had Star mumble something she wasn't sure if she wanted Ellesandra to hear, and as such was spoken quite low: "I'm not sure about that." But being told they would try to find another way had a little relief show on her face, though being told they wouldn't promise anything was still troubling. She wasn't happy with this result, and from then on would be paranoid about what she felt from Ellesandra. She thought about issuing an ultimatum but...She had to remind herself that those were rarely productive. Testing their relationship by making staunch demands of Ellesandra instead of working with them was not only unlikely to succeed, but she recalled how Ellesandra had said. How they walked away from their charge, that nameless woman who did what they were going to do despite Ellesandra walking away. Yes, she believed that Ellesandra had strong cause to stay with her but...She wouldn't play that game. There was another, better way, surely, to show how strongly she felt about this all. So she tucked away that instinct to threaten Ellesandra to take any self-inflicted pain upon herself with her sympathetic healing, and banished it from her mind. That wasn't the way. "I respect that these things are hard to talk about...And I mean it when I say I don't want to push you unduly. But unfortunately my desire to not have you bear any emotional pain when talking things out is at odds with my desire to help you heal the...Deeper, root cause that makes you feel like hurting yourself is necessary. So I respect that you don't want to talk about it any more tonight but...If you can't promise me that you won't indulge that desire to cope like that, then I can't promise I'll let the topic go. Just another thing that I'll be keeping in the back of my mind." She gently sighed after those words. "...But fine. If you have other things we need to talk about, go ahead. Let's talk about them."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra was quiet as Star spoke. She had heard what Star said about Sia, but she didn't know what it meant and so ignored it. When Star indicated she could speak about something else, Ellesandra paused and looked confused. "I - I don't have anything else to talk about?" She frowned in confusion until she realized Star meant the bit where Ellesandra was redirecting attention to their mission. "Oh, that was a suggestion we go and start doing research - not talk about it." There was a brief pause before Ellesandra mumbled. "I hate talking about things." It wasn't that she hated talking about things with Star, nothing against her directly. But talking about things always put Ellesandra in a...vulnerable state, depending on the topic. People wanted to know about the person they were talking with, and Ellesandra quite frequently was unwilling to share information. She'd shared more with Star than she had anyone since the incident. Moving, the plopped back down on the bed and looked at Star. There was a silent frustration and desperation in her, in regards to her emotions and how they kept creeping up like this. She truly did just want them gone. Somehow, just admitting to herself that she hated talking about things, and recognizing how much that invisible mountain was effecting her ability to just interact with someone pushed Ellesandra forward with their previous conversation. "I can't focus on them, Star." The words were whispered. Pained. "It's too much." It sounded like Ellesandra was going to cry, but there were no tears in her eyes. Her throat was constricting in a combination of fear of admitting that, of what could come after that, and how to approach this. It was getting closer and closer to Ellesandra seeing no way out from hiding from them, beyond removing them or...darker things.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star blinked, equally confused as...They didn't have the books yet. They still had to go retrieve them from the librarian, unless there was a plan in place to deliver them to this room. Really, Star was too upset at the time to clarify such transactional matters. She was still upset now, but for different reasons; the cuddling had done a lot to heal the previous upset. When Ellesandra said they hated talking about things, Star resisted the urge to throw a sarcastic 'I hadn't noticed' at them. The mood wasn't quite light enough for that kind of playful jabbing; this was reinforced as she saw the darkness welling up inside Ellesandra, seeing them sit on the bed and admit it was too much. Star shuffled to the edge of her bed, let her bare feet slide down to land on the floor, and gently placed her hands on the lip of the bed on either side of her so she could lean a little towards Ellesandra. "I know it is. It's had too long to grow, to fester and build itself up. It's gone ignored too long and taken too much of you for you to face it alone, too strong to face all at once. But you CAN face it, Ellesandra. Slowly. And starting by acknowledging the things that you will need to face it, before you try." She drew in a slow breath. "...There are a lot of things I can see in you that you might not realize you need. But even if you deny them, you do still need them as much as you need food and water and air. It...Made me very happy when you let yourself hold me, and just let yourself brush your hand through my hair. It felt nice. And I know you needed it, too. Everyone needs that. Everyone needs to feel...Comforted. A warmth to banish the frigid hand of loneliness." She wanted to just move over and hold Ellesandra but...She wanted Ellesandra to want it, too, instead of just forcing herself on them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She had meant going to get the books, but that no longer mattered, as it wasn't the topic of conversation anymore. No, Ellesandra felt her body closing in on itself as Star confirmed she needed to address it. The fear of doing so, the pain that was just beyond that barrier if she let herself feel it. The memory of the devastation she'd felt that night in the elven settlement, how it had crept up on her so suddenly and how overwhelming it had been. She moved to place her back against the head of the bed, against the wall or headboard, and brought her knees up close, wrapping her arms around them. It was an unconscious movement to get herself some self-provided physical comfort, even as Star encouraged her that she needed that. She shook her head, disagreeing with her despite the physical unconscious evidence being right there. "No, i just need to get rid of the feelings. I can't - just feel them. There are spells that make one forget things, right? Maybe we can find one that will work on me here. Then I'll be fine." If she could forget what happened, how Marigold died, everything from the point of that morning until after she'd left, then things would be better. Ellesandra would be confused she was sure, wondering why she'd left, but at the same time she wouldn't have this pain. And it was worth that. "We can ask Amelia." She muttered, the Myst native seeming to have a lot of magical knowledge - perhaps she would know how to do that or know someone who could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  It nearly broke Star's heart in half to see Ellesandra so...Desperate. She had to take a moment to pause and swallow a lump in her throat, eyes fluttering to hold back the tears. By all that was good in the world, it was hard to decide if it was more painful to watch or to hear. Star pushed up to her feet, then moved to Ellesandra's bed and moved to her knees in front of Ellesandra, sitting between her legs, then. "Ellesandra.." she said, her voice breaking. "No...No none of that is right, none of that is good. Please just...Take a moment to breathe, and let me help you. We don't have to talk but...I'd really like it if you let me hold you, let me comfort you right now. It will help. I promise, even if it gets worse first, it will be better if you let yourself have the comfort you need."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She wasn't quite sure what to do with that offer. There was a look of confusion at Star's approaching and getting on the bed. They had literally just spent time cuddling before her shower, hadn't they? Was that not enough? Sure that had been focused on giving Star comfort, not taking it herself, but that didn't really matter; tomayto tomahto, right? But then she thought about denying it, and how much something in her really, really didn't want to. It was a warring part, a conversation between the need for that physical comfort, to be held by someone, along with the need to be independent, to be able to just shrug this type of thing off. But she couldn't, she had to admit that to herself eventually. She couldn't just shrug this off like she'd been doing. Still, part of her resisted. "I don't neEd..." She paused as her voice cracked. She clenched her jaw, grinding her teeth together in frustration at her body's betrayal. At how her body wouldn't just listen to her, to ignore the damn emotions and make them not exist. She'd been doing this for three years, then Star came in and just riled up all of those emotions again. Was it because of Star, or was it just hitting it's natural time of not being able to be repressed anymore? She didn't know the answer to that. Turning, she repositioned so that she was laying on the bed, curled up in a fetal position much like she'd been in that field of flowers when she'd been breaking down. "I hate this." She whispered, though if Star moved to touch her, to hold her or cuddle her, Ellesandra would not pull away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see the internal war going on. She watched the conflicting desires fighting each other, the desire for independence versus the very real need for comfort. She worried that it would lead to anger but...She was relieved beyond words that it didn't. Just a little bit of fuss, which might make her smile were she not so concerned for the knight. She didn't touch them last time they were like this, but...This time she was happy to slowly ease down behind Ellesandra and slide her arms around them. One around their abdomen, the other under their neck to reach around and hug the opposite shoulder. A spooning position that let Ellesandra have a little privacy if they needed to cry, something that let them have a little privacy for it. Whether they needed that or not, she couldn't say, but she wanted them to have the option. She held them tenderly, but with a tightness that reflected how deep the concern in her heart ran. A hold that silently said: 'I won't ever let you go. Stay as long as you want to, as long as you need to.'.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt the arms coming around her and she both tensed, wanting to pull away, and also wanted to curl into them. The latter won, with her pressing herself back against Star. She hadn't needed to cry at first, fighting with the feelings and just keeping them pushed back, more exasperated at her situation and the fact she had feelings, frustrated at herself for them being such a major issue, than actively upset at them. But feeling Star wrap her arms around her, to hold her so tenderly, it broke something in her. She didn't know what, maybe it was that her barrier couldn't hold up against the emotions and also the need of being held finally being truly met, letting someone in like that, or maybe it was just a matter of time that it had happened. But for the second time that day, she broke down. It was slow at first, tears trickling out, but once the water gate had been opened, it began pouring out. The pain and loneliness being the biggest things right now, considering the trigger to this one had been finally being held again. Her hands gripped onto Star's arms holding her front, squeezing and curling up around them while her body began to slowly be wracked by sobbing. She kept it quiet, not loud echoing sobs, and really if Star wasn't holding her or able to see her emotions, it might be something she'd have been able to keep from her. It was shortly after the sobs started, as she was being held by Star, that she suddenly and quickly turned around in the embrace. She curled herself up into Star, pressing the top of her head against Star's chest and her arms sliding around the mage, holding tighter than was probably comfortable for her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star was no stranger to being an emotional mess at times. She cried like this semi-regularly, because she knew it was healthy, if there was a need to release those emotions. Ellesandra had been just stockpiling and accruing interest on her stockpile of pent up emotions, so a breakdown like this hardly surprised Star. When they turned in her arms and embraced her back, her eyes widened just a bit. The initial surprise passed, and she then smiled. She closed her eyes, moving one hand to rub Ellesandra's back, the other cradling their head so that her hand could gingerly stroke through Ellesandra's pretty hair. She cooed soft, sweet nothings to Ellesandra while cradling them against her. Quiet words to soothe, and reassure that it was all right to cry, to encourage them to let it out. Her chin tenderly rested on top of Ellesandra's head while she held them close. The tight physical contact let their auras mingle, and while Star did never, nor would ever, have any direct control over Ellesandra's emotions, her presence did carry a deeper comfort that physical affection alone could not produce quite so potently. Much the same as she was able to ward off nightmares, her aura and its waves of soothing comforts were a bastion against the darkest parts of a breakdown like this. She dare not interrupt Ellesandra as they processed their feelings, dare not keep them from feeling what they needed to feel, but she stood as a mystical bastion against the most frightening, darkest demons that such depths of sorrow could produce, while also allowing Ellesandra to feel, in a more pronounced degree, the tenderness of Star's physical affections. It was never easy to properly engrain within another the core sensation of security that fought against the anxieties of loneliness, but Star was uniquely equipped to make that process as easy as it could possibly be. It would still take time. It would still take many more tears. But Star would not relent in her quest to let Ellesandra finally breathe, after suffocating under such crushing weight for so long. The warmth of her hands. The soft, silken touch. The warm, airy scent of a misty waterfall amidst a blossoming field of colourful flowers that Star carried. The pleasant squish of Star's figure against them as Ellesandra squeezed so tight, not evoking even a single word of complaint as Star bore the mild discomfort of such a tight squeeze, knowing Ellesandra needed it. And of course, the soothing, tranquil presence of her aura resonating beautifully with Ellesandra's own, accepting them for all that they were, and whispering quietly to them that there was peace beyond the darkness of this sorrow. These were all the things that Ellesandra had fighting staunchly against the tides of anguish that assailed them.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She didn't stop, not quickly. Once released, despite having been crying earlier that day already, it was hard to stop again. Earlier, she'd ben crying from the overwhelming emotions from what she'd seen; the cruelties of life she'd been forced to live. None of it had been personal pain, it was easier to process and push away. This, though? This wasn't even really opening the mountain up; this wasn't even coming close to the true depth of pain she'd locked inside of her. Yet it was still enough to break her down, tear her walls and barriers and have the normally proud and stoic knight clinging to Star for every ounce of comfort she could get. The pure loneliness, dealing with all of this alone and not letting anyone truly touch her. Oh, she'd touched people, had even had a few romps during her travels, but no one truly TOUCHED her. Not until Star held her, at least. And this wasn't the first time, either. She'd turned her head up and eventually begun crying into Star's shoulder just for an effort of getting closer to the mage, snuggling as close as she possible could in it. Ten minutes would pass, then thirty before she felt her tears beginning to dry. It wasn't that the pain was gone, though. In some ways, it was worse. Being acknowledged that it was there, it couldn't just be shut away again; not easily anyways. So even as her tears slowed, her sobbing stopped, she didn't let go of Star, still holding tight. For Star's end, she would see that the one thing that helped the most, how Ellesandra unconsciously curled into the touch more, was Star's hand running through her wet hair. How she'd craved that, even more than simply being held.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star wasn't exactly happy to be in this situation, because it did mean that Ellesandra had pain at all, but considering the circumstance, the alternatives...Yes. She was, in that small way, happy. Happy that Ellesandra was finally letting themselves FEEL. A small comfort that this was the beginning of a...Very long journey to finally finding peace. Star knew the depths of the pain Ellesandra felt. She saw it from the very first moment she laid eyes on the knight. She knew this was just the dam cracking and leaking out the first, paltry wave. But that ANYTHING was allowed to actually be felt was progress. And of course, seeing how Ellesandra loved having their hair touched, she focused more on that. Her fingernails gingerly traced across their scalp, fingers splayed as she combed her digits through the silvery locks...Whatever whimsy possessed her to appreciate the pretty silver hair, adore it, show the knight how pretty she thought it was. The other hand was still tenderly brushing against their back, tempted to push under their clothes to run across their bare back but...Best not to push it, she figured. No need to complicate it. Sweet nothings continued to be whispered, small adjustments to let Ellesandra be close to her however they wished. Only when their tears stopped did her little whispers stop as well. But she didn't let go. She didn't hint for even a second that she wanted to let them go, either. Because truly, she didn't. She could, and indeed would if Ellesandra wanted it, hold them all night long without a word of fuss. She didn't need to break the silence, either. Ellesandra had a lot to process...Far be it from her to interrupt that, or rush them. No, she was happy to just savour this moment of closeness that, even if she was doing this to comfort Ellesandra, was a moment of closeness that she herself craved. Unlike Ellesandra, she acknowledged her own loneliness, and found the knight was an excellent cuddle partner in these scarce few times she'd been able to enjoy it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra lay there, letting the comfort come, letting the pain she'd cried out slowly settle back down behind the barrier. She had her eyes closed, and a new emotion would begin creeping up that Star might notice. Shame. Ashamed that she'd broken down like this, that she needed this type of comfort. She was supposed to be the guard, the one taking care of Star, and that she was relying on Star for this sent a brief pang of shame through her. Yet, even with the shame, she didn't move away from Star. She held on, letting the feel of her running fingers through her hair comfort her. A feeling she'd always been envious of seeing in others, how they'd lay their head in their mother's lap and their mother would just comb and pet their hair - it was why that touch meant more to Ellesandra than simply being held. It had been something she'd wanted, but never had. And now having it with Star, even if it was just in a comforting way and not the same motherly type affection she'd craved as a kid, that was important. It was a few more minutes of letting herself be held, and pretending she didn't enjoy it as much as she truly did, before she slowly pulled away from Star, turning her head away so Star couldn't see her face. It wasn't like Star didn't know exactly what was going on, that she'd been crying, but the shame at being seen breaking down like that was enough to cause her to keep looking away while she wiped the tear stains from her face. "Sorry." Was softly muttered, feeling the need to apologize and separate herself a little from Star else she might start crying again - and did she even have any tears left in her right now? "I..." She wanted to say an excuse, to wave it off, but she didn't say anything else. She didn't know what to say.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star could see the void of maternal affection. She had heard as much from Ellesandra in the past that they didn't have that sort of comfort. Really, growing up in Ellesandra's life sounded like a never-ending boot camp. It made them hard. Firm. Stalwart, of course, but at what cost? Star didn't resist when they pulled back, of course. But when Ellesandra apologized, she gently smiled and moved her hand that was on Ellesandra's back to perform the familiar motion from before. Two fingers tenderly pressed the pads for Ellesandra's lips. Not pressing in. Just resting her silken touch atop the pink flesh. "Don't you dare apologize for finally letting yourself feel, Ellesandra," she said, whisper quiet. "I will hold you like that every night on our journey together, if you want that. I'm awfully cuddly, you know." Another warm smile flashed here. "...But more importantly, you do so much to protect me. It's only natural that I'd want to protect you, too," she said, moving her hand from Ellesandra's lips to rest her palm tenderly over their heart so she might feel it thump against her hand, punctuating that she wasn't really capable of physically protecting Ellesandra more than they were able to protect themselves, but Star was certainly better equipped than perhaps anyone else to safeguard Ellesandra's poor, wounded heart.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was about to shake her head when she felt the fingers on her lips again. It caused her to freeze, and she looked up to meet Star's eyes finally as she spoke. The redness of her own blue eyes meeting Star's, and for a moment, a different desire surged in Ellesandra. The past few times she'd felt something with, or for, Star it was more like lust than it was anything else. A desire to take her and be sexually intimate. But now, right now? As Star moved her fingers away and placed her hand against Ellesandra's chest, she found herself wanting to capture Star's lips. Not to lead to sex, but just because...it felt like it would be the right thing to do. To seek out the comfort of a partner, not sex but affection. And as soon as that thought hit her, and those feelings became identified, Ellesandra pulled back. She stood, withdrawing from Star faster than she ever had before. There was panic, fear radiating from her from that thought. "Fuck." Was muttered quietly to herself. What was she supposed to do about that? She was catching fucking feelings and that was the literal last thing she needed on this journey; another charge that she truly cared about who might die on her. The fear sent another stab of pain through her, the reminder of just how familiar that fear was, and Ellesandra was standing near the door, unsure what to do. She wanted to run, but she didn't. But she definitely didn't want to go back to the bed where Star was. She was facing away from her, trying to focus on her breathing to recenter herself and push down the feelings of more than just lustful affection. All the while knowing that Star could see them, which made that fear even worse.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star certainly knew, in some part of the back of her mind, that their emotional bond could escalate to something stronger than just friendship. Star was very familiar with lustful affections being directed at her. Ellesandra wasn't the first. But Star was still a kissless virgin, because she didn't want lust. Not on its own. So each time someone advanced on her, she watched them for what was the driving pressure in their heart. And it had always been lust. But now, for the first time, she saw a bright spark of something more than lust for her. It wasn't that she didn't know what love looked like. She saw plenty of it in her mother, and held onto that emotion strongly. But this was a different love. One she had seen in other people for their husbands or wives or lovers, she saw plenty of it in Morrun and Lissana. And it was beautiful. But she was always able to stand by and watch that emotion from afar, away from being the source of the flame. This was not the case this time. As soon as it flickered in Ellesandra's heart, Star's face lit up with shock, and the heat, the redness, flowed into her cheeks faster than it ever had. Of course she saw it. It was...Blinding. Compared to Ellesandra's animated retreat, Star's reaction was...Paralysis in the wake of her gasp. Her heart was suddenly thundering in her chest. Her hand hovered in place where it had been pressed over Ellesandra's heart, fingers delicately trembling. And for perhaps the first time since Ellesandra met Star...Star didn't know what to do with the emotion she saw. She just looked at Ellesandra, her face beat red. She wasn't afraid, not upset, not angry, not rejecting the feeling in the slightest in contrast to Ellesandra. But Star's face was one of a woman who just had been confessed to and was trying to find the words to say. Stunned, but...Flattered, certainly. One spark passing from heart to heart, potentially igniting feelings in Star for Ellesandra all the same. She would find them eventually but...With Ellesandra's frantic state, there was a precious few seconds before Star could think of any words where they might say something or do something.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra kept her back to Star. She wouldn't have even called it love, even if it was pretty close to that. No, there was a level of it before it went to love, but the spark of that was there. It was something that can burn into love, if it could be given the opportunity. For now, it was true affection, caring, and...well, however 'like' looked. More than just the crush of a teen girl, but not quite to the point Ellesandra - even if she had been open to the feeling - would have been confessing love. Still, the fact that Ellesandra had Feelings for Star, more than just those of a friend or a charge, was unacceptable to her. While Star sat stunned, Ellesandra worked to cage those feelings and hide them in the deepest darkest corner that wasn't the mountain. She had one hand pressed against the wall and partially leaning on it, back to Star, until finally she pushed away and moved to begin putting her hair back up in a ponytail, lightly combing through it to fix the mess from their cuddle session. It reminded her of it being touched, and she briefly wondered if those feelings were simply because Star was the first person to really hold her in a long, long time. It was possible, but thinking about it was still recognizing it as an actual emotion, which wasn't okay. "I'm going to go see about us getting some lunch. Stay here." She ordered, a gruff voice that was still raw from the crying. She turned to the door, and as her hand was on the doorknob she paused. "I know.." She took a breath. "You saw that. But no, you didn't. It won't happen." It can't. She could not let that happen, not again. The thought tugged again at the mountain, the grief that was not just the grief of losing a charge. It was the grief of losing someone that Ellesandra had been in love with; someone she had grown up with, the only true friend Ellesandra had ever had. She couldn't put Star in the same position to lose again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star certainly discerned the degree of affection for what it was. A spark of something greater. Romantic affection. Love, in all its beauty, took time. Took a great amount of care to mature and blossom. But it remained that the spark was a flicker of that emotion in its infancy. And it remained the first time she had seen it in someone else, for her. So Ellesandra snuffing it out immediately was an icy talon curling into her heart and YANKING backwards to tear her chest open. Ellesandra nor Star would have the foreknowledge necessary to understand what happened next: Star moved to stand between the two beds. Her hands balled into fists. Her teeth barred. Her aura then swelled, and her eyes glazed over with a shine of mana. Despite the dampening field that oppressed all the magic that was not permitted in Myst, Star's magic, her auramancy, was burning with a potent intensity. Enough that within the confines of the room, Ellesandra would feel the connection of emotion as if the two were touching, despite standing those few feet apart. The aura that normally clung around Star's frame ballooned outwards until the shimmering rush of blues and flashes of reds, pinks, greens, and a myriad of smaller colours overtook the entire room. "ENOUGH!" she shouted, emitting a powerful rush of emotion through the room that would hit Ellesandra like a hammer to the chest. Anger. Frustration. Defiance of this decree that she didn't see it. The anger wasn't malicious or directed at Ellesandra. There was an innate knowledge with this powerful field of emotional strength that Star wasn't going to hurt Ellesandra. But there was a pounding, oppressive pain in Star's heart now. A fresh wound torn open that Ellesandra felt plainly, no matter how much Ellesandra might try to separate their emotions. And while it wouldn't be impossible to move, there was some measure of paralyzing weight to what exuded off of Star. Strangely, Ellesandra would also feel a potent healing energy rise up in them. Stronger than any healing force they had ever felt in their life, given their natural resistance to typical divine and arcane healing. There was a stirring, wild, and chaotic hum of mana that connected Star and Ellesandra in that moment. It wasn't contained or controlled. But it was powerful. The burn on Ellesandra's skin vanished. The soreness in their muscles became a distant memory. Bruises, cuts, surface injuries melted off the woman. But more than that? The ache, the stiffness, in Ellesandra's right arm tingled. It was subtle. Exceptionally subtle. But the constant ache in that shoulder and arm that was forever present got...Just a tiny, tiny bit less so. The swirling, chaotic emotions surged in the wake of this healing. Jealousy. Affection. Adoration. Tenderness. Desire. Loneliness. A tight ball of conflicting feelings that dueled between desire and rejection. "Stop REJECTING everything!" she shouted again. And in that moment, there was a heavy thump in Ellesandra's chest as their heart pounded against its cage, then pushed into a steady rhythm that had a...Second heartbeat? That heartbeat didn't belong to Ellesandra. But it beat in unison with their heart. Then, as swiftly as the emotional surge arrived, it burst into a flickering field of sparkly motes of mana, and Star's aura receded again into her, turning invisible to Ellesandra once more as Star herself lost the bright shine in her eyes and fell to her knees, clutching with both hands at her heart, heaving and trembling. Obviously alive, and looked...At least somewhat stable. But whatever it was that just happened had evoked some measure of stress in her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Fuck around, and Ellesandra was about to find out. Her hand was still on the doorknob when she saw Star moving to stand, looking angry. Ellesandra tensed, unsure if Star was about to throw a punch at her or something - but that would have been much easier to deal with than what actually happened. Suddenly, the room was completely full of her aura and Ellesandra could feel the magic coming off of Star. It was as if she was feeling everything Star was feeling, and the feeling of red, rage, anger frustration - it hit her full force. It felt like a punch to the gut and Ellesandra froze; if this were a physical pressure, Ellesandra might have been able to fight against it, to not be paralyzed by how much emotion was suddenly being thrown in her direction. But it wasn't physical; it was emotional and Ellesandra was NOT good at properly resisting that, not like Star might have been. It was the pain that got her, though. The feeling of pain in Star at how Ellesandra had so callously taken the realized feelings and locked them away. Truly feeling how she had hurt Star had her own pain and guilt rising up, nowhere near in equal measure to the current overwhelming aura but still there. She stood at the door, hand having not even moved because she was so frozen, staring at Star and not even noticing the healing energy going through her. Oh, she'd notice later, but right now? She didn't have the mental processing power to notice that along with everything else happening. The next shout caused Ellesandra to flinch, and then there was the...thump, in her chest. Like she could feel Star's heartbeat along hers. Then it all went away, and Star was on her knees in trembling in the room. Ellesandra stood frozen for a second, trying to figure out what the hell had just happened. It was impossible, to feel a second heart inside your chest, wasn't it? Her hand raised to it, and then she saw Star on her knees again. Guilt gnawed at her, along with concern and worry for Star. She stepped over to her, moving to place a hand on her shoulder but stopping. Would that be welcome? Star was obviously angry enough at her to lose control and do...whatever that was. There was trepidation now. Not that Ellesandra was afraid of Star herself, or that Star would hurt her or anything, but just...being unsure how to go forward from this. "Star..." She whispered, standing awkwardly beside the kneeling woman. "Are...what was...are you okay?" She could ask what that was later. Right now, she focused her priority on making sure her charge was alright.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  The answer to whether or not Star was all right was swiftly answered. Not with a verbal response or a nod but...With Star gently falling onto her side, slumping, unconscious. She was still breathing. A bit heavy, but not obstructed or weak. Not alarm bells there. But if Ellesandra saw fit to touch Star at any point instead of just letting them lay there on the floor for however long they would be there, Ellesandra would find Star to be hot. Feverish. Sweat pooled on her brow. Star had never been seen sweating from walking or being in the heat during their travels, but Star had consistently shown sweat on her brow each of the times she pushed herself past her limits with her magic, the times she had forced herself to bleed from her nose from the exertion of her magic. Whatever it meant, Star was passed out now. After a few minutes, light trembles would suffuse her figure, consistent with the fever that was easily felt just touching the woman.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's concern skyrocketed when Star passed out. She didn't even get to the point of slumping to the ground before Ellesandra had caught her, giving her a light shake. "Star - hey, Star." She tried, but Star didn't wake. She was breathing fine, but she felt warm and she was sweating. A frown crossed Ellesandra's face and she knelt down to slide both hands beneath Star, preparing to lift her with most of the weight on her left arm and her right just being used to mostly balance the woman. This went a bit smoother than she was expecting, having braced herself for pain shooting through her right arm, along with her rib from the recent fight, at the exertion. The pain didn't come, though. Oh, it was still uncomfortable; her right arm was still weak and couldn't carry Star on it's own, but the pain didn't come from it. And it was like her bruised and battered rib had been completely healed. That information was tucked away for later, while she carried Star over to Ellesandra's bed - not Star's - and placed her down in it where they had just been laying together before. A moment passed where she watched Star, confirming she continued to breathe and just seemed to be sleeping. When the trembles started, she held her hand to Star's forehead and felt the heat. Whether that was from magic exertion or from some illness, Ellesandra wasn't sure. She pulled the covers back and moved them up to carefully tuck around Star though, before moving to her pack and pulling out the coin that Amelia had given her. If this were a physical illness, Ellesandra would have just went to get some soup and water for Star, but with that coming after such an obviously large usage of magic Ellesandra was concerned. Unfortunately, she didn't know enough about such major use of Star's magic. Did it work like arcane magic, or more like Ellesandra's magic in which it drew upon her physical strength? Either way, Ellesandra wasn't going to just leave Star there to recover. She remembered her limit of words, closed her eyes, and then used the coin to send a message to Amelia. "Star got angry and something with major magic happened. She's now passed out and has the shivers. Haven't seen this before. Can you help?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Ellesandra wouldn't be waiting long before there was an answer to their query, though it didn't come from the mental message of the coin. Instead, the door flung open to reveal Amara standing in it, her face hardened with spear in one hand. She stepped into the room, looking around. Not at Ellesandra or Star of course, but she was stepping in as if looking for some other threat. Amelia was right behind, having just received Ellesandra's mental message moments before the door was thrust open. Amara, seeing no threats, looked at Ellesandra. "...Are you both okay?" she asked, clearly concerned and weapon having been ready to strike at some enemy. "There was a surge of magic detected, not one from a source the dampening field permits." Still, seeing no obvious threat, Amara put her spear on her back again. Amelia then looked at Ellesandra. "...Define 'something major magic'. Did something happen to Star?" asked Amelia, earning a weird look from Amara, clearly only more confused. Amelia rolled her eyes, briefly fishing into the pouch at her waist to produce the matching coin. "Sending coin, captain. She was just calling for help." She then looked to Ellesandra again. "...And as for whether I can help, certainly one of us ought to be able to, if you can explain a bit more." Amelia then looked at Amara and nudged her head towards Star. "Unconscious with shivers," she said, passing along Ellesandra's message. Amara was about to approach, but she looked at Ellesandra for confirmation. Amara was a paladin, so healing was certainly within her repertoire. But she had a mutual respect for Ellesandra that saw her silently asking for permission to tend to Star, given that Star was under Ellesandra's protection.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When the door flung open, Ellesandra had already stepped to the bed and grabbed her rapier. It was half out at the intruders who came in with a spear before she realized it was Amara and Amelia, having already been on edge with what just happened. She clenched her teeth, eyeing the two, then sheathing it again fully. Well, there went her promise to not draw her blade unnecessarily in Myst. At least, she hadn't fully drawn it, and to be fair Amara had thrown the door open with her own spear out first. Ellesandra eyed the spear, even as they asked if everything was okay and Amelia explained to Amara. Even with the spear on Amara's back, the look from Amara to seek permission wasn't instantly given an affirmative. Ellesandra watched Amara for a few moments, weighing the decision, but she had very much seen Amara heal herself on the battlefield. That, and knowing that it was unlikely either of them had caused this with Star, since she felt like SHE had been the one to cause whatever happened, she nodded and would step to the side so that Amara would have access to the unconscious mage. Ellesandra glanced briefly at Amelia, but her eyes turned back to Star and Amara, keeping a careful eye on what was being done just to ensure. A show of trust for Amara, but not wholehearted. "I did something that upset her, and then her magic just exploded. Not - physical explosion." She paused, unsure how much to share about Star's magic, but she had to share something, right? "While my magic is physical focused, hers is...aura and emotion focused. It was like her aura filled up the whole room, and I could feel her emotions. I can do that when touching her normally, but only when there's physical contact; never from a distance." Well there was that time outside the camp when fighting the pirates she'd briefly felt some of Star's emotions before Stare shouted at the pirate captain, but she'd been a little too distracted getting choked at the time to notice much about it. "And then after yelling a bit, she - um. Maybe magically exhausted herself? And collapsed shortly after the magical aura went away." There was obviously more to it, but that was a decent enough high level summary without going into detail about what triggered it, or exactly how Star's magic worked. No need to explain anything about resonance or how she'd literally felt a second heartbeat in her chest for a while.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara showed a look of understanding when Ellesandra almost drew their rapier. It was a tense moment, and she hadn't exactly knocked. There'd be no worry about Ellesandra being tossed in a jail cell over it. Amara nodded to Ellesandra when they stepped aside, and Amara more fully removed her spear then, setting it to rest against the wooden footboard of the bed Star was using. Close by, but she had no business bringing a weapon near Star who was unconscious. She brought it because there was worry about enemies attacking these two, something Amara idly explained with a relieved sigh leaving her. "Here I thought it was the work of one of your enemies, and I had come prepared to fight," she said as she moved to sit next to Star. She slowly laid her right hand down upon Star's forehead. A soft white light bloomed from under her palm as Amara closed her eyes. Amelia spoke while this went on. "Aura and...Emotion?" she asked, confusion and disbelief flooding her mind. Magic that she was unaware of. A fact that was clearly clashing with her ego. "So you're saying Star used...Magic? Here? That..." She looked at Amara. "...That shouldn't be possible," she said, crossing her arms as she looked back at Ellesandra. "If what you're saying is true, it means she uses a magic that isn't arcane in nature, nor divine. But the whole...Upending of hundreds of years of magical theory aside, what do you mean you...Felt her emotions? Like, magical empathy?" Questions that were given a short moment to answer before Amara removed her palm and looked at Ellesandra with some amount of uncertainty. "Well, there's...Nothing physically wrong with her. Nothing that I can sense, at least. Heart's beating fine, breathing fine, no injuries, no illness, no curse, not even really any exhaustion that I can feel, really. Far as I can feel...She ought to be right as rain." As comforting as that might be, the fact that Star was obviously not fine had Amara wearing a vexed expression. Her eyes then flicked to Ellesandra, then Amelia, then back to Ellesandra, looking for the knight's thoughts on what to do next, given Star was their charge.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
She nodded to Amara's explanation, and appreciated the woman laying her spear down away. Still close, but the obvious sign of allyship was taken as it was intended. She didn't smile, but there was an understanding there. That being said, Ellesandra still didn't put her rapier down entirely. She buckled it back to her hip while watching Amara work and listening to Amelia speak in surprise. "She told you she was a rare kind of magic user and she's looking at her home plane for information on it, didn't she? Magical empathy is probably the best explanation, yes. I don't understand it all myself." Getting confirmation that there was nothing physically wrong with her was both a relief and even more worrying. A glance was given to Amara, then back to Star. "The few times I've seen her really extend her magic and go beyond her limits, she's had a nose bleed and been very physically weak afterwards. I had to carry her after one such expenditure, and she all but fell asleep on my back. I would say it's likely that." Likely, but there was the possibility that something was wrong with her magic. Ellesandra had literally felt Star's heart beating in her own chest, or at least a second heart beating there and she'd assumed it was Star's. Who elses would it be? But Amara confirmed her heart was beating fine so... She pursed her lips and stepped up to Star. With Star's magic being as different as it was, she wasn't confident Amelia would be able to do anything, and she wanted to try something. She placed a hand on Star's forehead, testing to see if she felt the...resonance, or connection of their aura's like normal. And if she did, she tried to...feed Star's. Push whatever energy or feeling of her own aura, like she'd gotten when Star showed her how to share a memory, through to Star. As if she was trying to share her own energy and power with Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara, deciding she had quite expended her usefulness in the moment, got up and out of Amara's way, grabbing her spear to move to the other side of the room by the door, then idly left it leaning on the wall as she took posture to just fold her arms and observe. Amelia accepted Ellesandra's words with a brief purse of her lips. "Suppose she did," she said, not one to argue with logic when it proved logical. Ellesandra's attempt to embrace the resonance was met with a fruitful discovery. Star's aura resonated with Ellesandra's, giving Ellesandra a view into Star's current state. Ellesandra was able to feel Star's aura. And therein lay the problem. Star's aura was...Discordant. Normally, each time Ellesandra had felt it, it had been whole, calm - even if Star herself wasn't, and orderly. But now? It was still in one piece, of course, but it wasn't...Flowing. The passage of energy through Star was disrupted and out of harmony with itself. Ellesandra's attempt to feed their own power into Star's aura was clumsy. Their exposure to Star's powers and auramancy in general had allowed Ellesandra to sense their own aura, but there was some other force that eluded understanding within Ellesandra that gave them the capacity to grasp at their own aura and do the utmost basic manipulation of directing some of their own energy into Star, and Ellesandra would feel the fatigue build in them swiftly for doing so. It wasn't a physical fatigue, however. Rather, some part of Ellesandra that they were not in tune with was weakened. The only practical effects of this were that first, Ellesandra's nose began to bleed. Mild, just a few drops before it stopped. The other being that Ellesandra would suddenly feel like they could REALLY go for a nap. Unfortunately, this effort had not really changed much for Star. Ellesandra's capacity for auramancy was like that of a thief making first use of their lockpicks, except Star's aura was a grand vault door made of enchanted metals with a thousand locks to pick for how difficult it felt for Ellesandra do properly affect it. Unsurprisingly out of their depth to an immense degree, they really only managed to tire themselves out, without actually being tired. Surely Star would be able to explain what was happening, but they were unfortunately unconscious, and therefore not very talkative. But for their effort, Ellesandra would at least notice a tiny, single white spark had jumped from their aura, to Star's, both of which were briefly, faintly visible to Ellesandra for just a split second. But even if Ellesandra had not fixed anything, the source of Star's malaise was clear. Something was wrong with Star's aura after what happened. But Ellesandra, certainly like everyone else in this city, would only be able to guess as to what that meant. Was it no big deal and Star just needed rest? Did Star need help? Was there something anyone could even do, if something had to be done to fix her? Truly, it was likely that the person in the whole of Myst who understood Star's magic the best, aside from Star herself, was Ellesandra.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wasn't QUITE sure what the hell she was feeling. Sure she was aware of it all, it had been explained and she'd felt Star's aura before, but this was...different. It was a lot more, and even as she tried to send energy to Star, she felt her own body growing weaker. This is how she imagined it probably felt when Star healed her, magically anyways. She didn't notice the trickling of a nose bleed, so focused on trying to figure this out for Star, until a bit of blood flowed over the upper curve of her lip. It didn't drop down, but she could taste her own blood on her lips, and that caused her to pull her hand away and stop what she was doing. She could handle some personal exhaustion, feeling like a nap would be nice, but she didn't want to play with powers she didn't understand if it was going to cause bleeding. Her hand went up wipe the blood away, lightly licking the bit off her lip and then sniffing the rest up a little. Well, that didn't work, though realizing her nose randomly started bleeding and Amara and Amelia were still there, she threw them both a quick glance. "Something's wrong." She muttered, head motioned towards Star. Duh, that was obvious, so she continued to try to explain. "I...I tried to reach out to feel her. Earlier she showed me how to...share something from my aura supposedly." Ellesandra was not speaking as if she really knew what she was talking about because, well, she didn't. "So I tried to do something similar, see if I could feel or empower her in any way. It didn't work but there's something wrong with how her aura feels. It's different than it ever has been before." Which was a whole loot of hooplah for making sense to anyone. Maybe Amelia would understand, but even that was doubtful. Her arms crossed and she frowned down at Star. "Do...do they have any books here on something like an aura? Maybe a soul, or essence or something like that? I'm honestly not sure the difference between such things and an Aura, except an aura is colorful and you can interpret someone's emotions and meanings behind them, if you're practiced at it."
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amelia and Amara watched with interest and concern as the scene played out. There was knowledge to be gained here after all. If Ellesandra had been truthful, it was possibly the wider discovery of a heretofore exceptionally esoteric form of magic. So many questions begged answering, and Amelia would be taking physical notes if this wasn't a delicate situation. Mental noted would have to do for now. When Ellesandra pulled away, there was a...cling. Star's aura latched on ever so briefly, as if trying to get Ellesandra to stay. So much of auramancy that Star had showed revolved around what one felt, rather than rational understanding or logic that a wizard might use for their spells. Perhaps it was important, perhaps it was nothing. Amelia was paying close attention when explanations began. She crossed her arms. "To be quite honest with you I had never heard the term before you had said it. So of course, I have already put in a query with Capi to answer that question. I thought it prudent given that was central to the expressed goal. And I can't deny I am curious myself. So the answer I have for you right NOW is...I have no idea if there are any books in the archive that reference this sort of magic. But the question has been at least asked. The archives are beyond massive. So as efficient as the search process is, I estimate you won't have an answer until tonight. Maybe tomorrow morning. I recognize that may not be ideal, but you will need to trust me that it is far faster than the thousand years it would take you to search manually."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra really didn't care much about their interest in a new form of magic. Her main focus was figuring out a way to make Star better. The guilt settled firmly in her gut, thinking back to how Star had just...blown up. At how her, taking that little spark, flame of interest in Star and pushing it away, had caused that. Her jaw set and she closed her eyes, blocking out the room and instead feeling how Star's aura had reached out for her. The memory of it not wanting to let her go as she moved away. After a few moments, standing with her eyes closed and letting Amelia talk about the archives, she would sit down next to Star, placing her hand on Star's shoulder. Not that she expected this to do anything, but if she could feel Star's aura, and it was reaching out to her and not wanting her to let go, maybe that was Star unconsciously telling her what to do. At the very least, she could maintain contact. It's something Star preferred and enjoyed, normally. Looking up to Amelia after a moment, she nodded. "Understood. I think I'll be here until then, at least." She was tired, from her attempting to push her aura onto Star to help. Tired might not be the right word, but the temptation to lay down next to Star, cuddle up and nap was there. Not that she'd ever tell Amara or Amelia that. "Any chance I can get a hot meal from somewhere in the meantime?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara plucked her spear from the wall and set it across her back once more. "I'll be back shortly with that for you," she said, objective-focused, but compassionate as she addressed Ellesandra. "Amelia, speak to Serenity in the mean time. I'm sure under normal circumstance, Capi will be sufficient. But nobody knows the archives better than Serenity. Not even Capi. That's our best chance." Amara carried herself with an authority in the moment, a leadership that was unsurprising given her title, but one she hoped would resonate with Ellesandra and comfort them by communicating that Amara wasn't going to just rest on her laurels on the matter. Amelia nodded with a firm "Yes, Captain," before giving one last glance at Ellesandra and Star. A flash of concern, of who Amelia was under her attitude, was visible then. Eyes that carried genuine worry. Lips that ever so subtly trembled in fear that the life of a good person was in danger. She looked away again after a moment, directed by duty to her captain to do as ordered. Amara followed behind, grasping the door handle as she moved to exit. "Be back shortly, Ellesandra." With those words, the door was gently closed, and the two walked off. Star's aura could be felt by the contact to her shoulder. It still felt abnormal. Broken, somehow. But there was method to the chaos of it all. Subtle patterns and rhythms. Some small things Ellesandra could understand implicitly. Not an understanding like what one might glean from a text, but rather just what Ellesandra felt upon themselves. It was perhaps only now, that Star's aura felt so abnormal, that Ellesandra could pick up on details that otherwise were too natural to register. The resonance that had been spoken of, the way that their auras were able to simply...Flow through one another. It was disrupted. The emotional walls that Ellesandra had always tried to put up were firmly in place, now. Perhaps when Ellesandra might want to feel how Star was doing the most, to know they were okay, it was beyond reach. Instead of waves of calm waters slowly flowing over the white sands of a pristine beach, the waves of energy, of their auras, crashed against each other as if jagged, shifting rocks shot up in the waters of the shore, constantly changing to prevent the flow of the waters from being even. Turbulence disrupted the serenity that Star's presence always had carried. But through all of that turbulence, one truth proved consistent: Ellesandra's presence was there, it was recognized. And though the attempt to mend the damage proved to highlight the complexity of auramancy in how strenuous effort was expended for little to no effect, Ellesandra's own aura still served as a guiding light on this stormy night in Star's heart. The contact that was maintained was doing...Something. How much of a something it was doing was difficult to tell. But certainly...Something.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra did appreciate the help from both Amara and Amelia. She nodded in appreciation towards Amara at offering to get her food, as well as taking charge of the situation, and also pushing to get information rather than just letting this magical embodiment of a creature search for it. The appreciation was there, but she remained silent as they both left, watching the door close before her eyes turned back to Star. The feeling of her aura was...odd. Definitely odd that she could feel Star's aura, without necessarily feeling her emotions. That, in all honesty, was an improvement - minus Star being unconscious of course. A sigh and she lightly rubbed at Star's shoulder, ensuring she maintained contact while looking down into her own lap. "I'm sorry." The words were soft, obviously not expecting any response with Star being unconscious. Maybe the emotions, the regret, would be able to be felt by Star in whatever state she was in? Either way. She didn't want to push too much into the Aura field again, having almost exhausted herself with little to show for it earlier, so instead she moved to lay down next to Star. She lightly wrapped her body around Star, holding her just like she had that morning when trying to provide her comfort. She had no idea if the increased contact would help or not, but was just doing the only thing she knew. Ellesandra wasn't comfortable poking around in the resonant aura she could feel, not only because she didn't know enough about what she was doing but also because she was afraid she would poke into emotions, things she shouldn't see. If Star didn't get better after a day or two she'd resort to that, but right now she was just going to assume rest and comfort was needed. And if there were no changes from Star she would stay there, cuddling Star's unconscious form, until Amara would return. When Amara did return, Ellesandra simply raised her head and looked towards the door, a soft - "Her aura responds to being held, hoping it helps." To what would probably be an unspoken question of why Ellesandra was cuddling her unconscious charge.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star remained unconscious. Slow, gentle breaths passed in and out of her chest. Her body remained feverish. The occasional, uncomfortable shift came from her unconscious self. Movement was certainly a good sign, a sign she was more likely asleep, or something of that sort, than she was in some sort of long-lasting coma. The subtle shakes she had were persistent for a while, but after some time of Ellesandra holding her close, the shivers subsided, and a bit more calm came over her. It was quietly reassuring that she was going to be okay, but too much uncertainty still remained to be sure of anything. When Amara did walk back in, seeing Ellesandra and Star as they were, and then hearing the pre-emptive explanation, Amara rose a hand up. She was in her plain clothes again, no armor nor spear to be found. Changed while waiting for the food to be ready. A plate of pork roast, with mashed potatoes and gravy, and steamed veggies. Simple, but filling. "You don't have to explain," she said with a soft smile. "Not really my business. But I was quietly hoping I was going to be proven wrong in expecting her to still be out when I came back." A little remorse was in her voice, though not much surprise. She moved to rest the tray she carried, which also had a mug of hot tea, on the table between the two beds for Ellesandra, not wishing to overstay her welcome. She wouldn't object if Ellesandra asked her to stay, but she assumed the woman wanted to be alone with Star, so would quietly excuse herself if there was no conversation to be had.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
The movement was a good sign, one that made Ellesandra feel a little better. She felt even better after that from the shivers stopping, after a bit. When the food was brought in and placed between their tables, Ellesandra would move to sit up - though she was careful to ensure some form of contact with Star as she did so. A glance was given to the food, and the tea that was there as well. "Thank you. If there's anything you need from me when we have time, let me know." A favor for a favor. Ellesandra appreciated and recognized it, so she wanted it clear that she considered herself in Amara's debt. Still, she would wait for Amara to leave before she moved to where she sat on the side of the bed. She had grabbed Star's hand and moved it so it rested in her lap, to ensure she didn't accidentally pull contact away, while reaching for food. Normally she would have just laid there, but after having given some form of energy - whatever form it was - to Star earlier, she felt like eating and not just skipping her meal was ideal. She ate slowly, letting the tea cool and then sipping at it because it was what she'd been given. She saved all of the veggies for Star when she woke; it would be cold, but it'd still be there and easily accessible until Ellesandra could go get her more food. When done, she'd set the plate back on the table, and then lay back down next to Star, taking on the cuddling position again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Amara gave a smile and nod before departing. While she didn't really feel like Ellesandra owed her, she similarly wouldn't deny the other woman the honour of repaying kindness if they felt they had to. Amara could probably think of something in time, but left them for now. Star remained unconscious while Ellesandra cuddled up again, little to no movement. So it was, Ellesandra got to drift away and nap. A nap that was entirely free of the pull of lucidity. No doors. No card. Just a normal drift into unconsciousness. However, being cuddled up against Star did mean there was still some influence on Ellesandra's dreams. Unfortunately, not a good one. For rather than soothe and guard against Ellesandra's nightmares, the chaos, the discordant and fluctuating waves of Star's broken aura instead ensured that, in some way or another, Ellesandra would endure visions of Star in their dreams where Star was hurt, suffering, in pain, crying...A reflection, in one form or a thousand, that Star was in distress. No imagery of Star dying, however. But pain, emotional or physical, in a single or varied scenarios, were the product of the influence of this damaged harmony. Unpleasant dreams they certainly would prove to be, making gainful rest difficult to acquire. A nap would be enough to take the edge off that implacable fatigue, but it was traded instead for regular fatigue of sleeping for four hours but feeling somehow like one slept a negative amount of time for how jumbled and foggy their mind would be upon waking.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra jerked a few times in the dreams. Seeing Star chained up, captured, falling and breaking a leg, a million different careless acts that could cause her pain. She didn't cry out or make any sounds for these, but they were certainly not pleasant dreams. When she did wake, about four hours later apparently, she felt...both better, and worse. She straightened, noticing that Star was still laying there and asleep. She groaned and stretched, feeling again a surprising flexibility to her right arm. It wasn't enough to the point that she could fully move it like before it was injured, but it was still noticeable. Was it that she'd healed Ellesandra, that caused her to lose so much energy and pass out? Or was it the general expenditure of her energy? No, she'd definitely felt something wrong with Star's aura; it wasn't simply having used too much energy. Reaching for the tea, long since cold by now, she'd take a few sips just to get the dry mouth, post bad nap addressed, before she turned her attention back down to Star. Once again, her hand moved to press against Star's forehead, feeling for if the fever was still going, and if she could sense anything different at all in her aura since before her nap.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star's fever was still present. A simple touch would confirm it, and she was quite sweaty for it. On her forehead and neck, mostly, but the thin sheen of sweat clung to the rest of her figure. Another sign of her malaise. A little worse than when Ellesandra had gone to bed, though there was no way to know if Star would have been better, the same, or even worse without Ellesandra's presence. Still a troubling sign, but only mildly so. She didn't hold the signs of someone who was seriously, gravely ill. The fever seemed to be the start and end of it. But getting worse was still getting worse, even if it was slow. Would she bounce back? There was no way to tell. Only guesswork to be done. But while Ellesandra might be thinking on this, there was a quiet knock at the door. The knock of someone not wanting to wake someone if they were sleeping, but loud enough to still be heard easily.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra frowned while feeling that fever. That was...not good. She'd gotten worse over the nap, not better. While she might have gotten better briefly, she was worse now. Ellesandra was just considering what to do in regards to that when she heard the knock. She almost shouted to come in, but looking down at Star she was unsure that speaking in raised voices was a good idea. Instead, she released her hold on Star for the first time since her first checking for a fever and moved to the door. Opening it a crack, she would glance out, and only open it fully if it was someone she recognized at the door. She wore a concerned expression on her normally stoic face, and had obviously just been napping considering there might have been the type of red marking on her face that came from sleeping on Star like one would get when pressing their face against something for a long period of time.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  "A-Apologies, if I've disturbed you," came the voice of none other than Serenity, the librarian. She was dressed in the same dress she had been wearing earlier in all its splendid elegance. She had in her hands a hardcovered book. On the cover, it had very plain and technical writing that described it: [Journal: Xannus the Clear. Transcription #22.] Below that was the date, as well as the name of the transcriber. Serenity wore a difficult expression. "It's...Not a lot. But Amelia relayed your message, wanting to know about the magic of Miss. Star. I...Hasten to admit it is truly rare for there to be so little on a subject. But the plane in question where Miss. Star hails from, Gurhal, is already something that has scarce information on it. I've collected some tomes and records that have relevant information for that matter that I can have brought to you but...I thought you'd wish to begin with something that does actually speak to this sort of magic directly. Even this," she said, holding the volume out for Ellesandra. "Is an incomplete record. It's a transcription of the original journal of the magi named. The original journal is within the archives, but it's only the first few pages. This is a copy of what can be recovered from the original, as the rest is lost or destroyed. I...Do not know how helpful it will be, but it is...Something. I hope."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took a moment, watching Serenity quietly. And then, the door fully opened and she reached for the book offered, taking it and looking down at it. Xannus the Clear? Didn't seem to be the naming convention of Star's family, at least not to Ellesandra's knowledge. What celestial object would be named 'Xannus'? Could be a report of someone who encountered someone like Star. She sighed, looking at it's thickness, then looking back up to Serenity and nodding. "Thank you, Miss Serenity. I'll..." She paused, glancing back at Star still sleeping on the bed. She dreaded having to read or study this book, it was one thing she had never gotten good at. Oh, she could read - her 'parents' had ensured that so that she didn't embarrass them or Marigold. But she never had a talent for it, and it frequently hurt her head to focus on. "I'll see what I can find in it. I - now may not be the time, but I understand knowledge is expected in return in situations like this. Can I set up some time to offer something to the library later? I've got my own particular magic which might provide some insight or additional knowledge." Even if it wasn't as rare or unique as Star's. Rare, in a way, by her unique ability to absorb and resist magic as a human, but otherwise it worked much like all other magic did.

  Serenity smiled, folding her hands neat and proper before her. The scars she tried to hide were barely visible beneath the cuff of her sleeves. "Please. Don't worry about that right now. There will be time to talk about the balance of fairness when the health of a friend is not in the balance. Focus on this, now. We can speak when everything is well again." With that, she once more flashed a smile, then gently bowed to excuse herself. She didn't want to take up the knight's time, only wished to help. She would of course stop if there was further business, but assuming not, left Ellesandra to return to Star. The transcribed book was, perhaps to Ellesandra's delight, quite small. Not many pages. It was asserted that it was just an excerpt of the full work, after all.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra closed the door and then sighed, looking down at the book, then back up to Star. Moving to set the book on the table between beds, she walked around to the attached bathroom and got a small hand towel, which she wet with some cold water before wringing it out and bringing it back into the bedroom. She lightly pulled Star's chin down to open her mouth, wringing some of the last cool water into her mouth. It wasn't enough to cause any choking, but just enough to give her a bit of water and hydration. After doing this, she placed the cool rag over Star's forehead to try and help cool the fever down. "You just had to go and throw a tantrum huh?" She muttered, not serious about the jab. It also wasn't really a tantrum; Ellesandra recognized that it was entirely her fault that she'd pushed Star that far by pulling herself back like that. Taking Star's hand she did what she did while eating, placing it in her lap to ensure contact was maintained while Turning, she took the book and opened it up, flipping through to where it looked like it started. She was careful to hold it steady as she started to read, and she read each paragraph a couple of times. Each one she had to work through what she read, the letters becoming jumbled here and there and needing the multiple iterations to fully understand. Dyslexia was a bitch when you felt pressure to read to learn whatever you could.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star loosed a soft, breathy sound of...Was it good or bad? It was hard to tell, but maybe it was just discomfort at the cold. Maybe relief at having the towel placed on her forehead. She seemed to relax a little from it, at least. But she was still unconscious for now. Plenty of peace for Ellesandra to take as much time as they needed to read the book, best they could. The font was very legible, text written in a script that was large enough to be easily read. Not so large as to be wasteful with space, but it did seem that some liberty was taken in transcribing the journal so that it was easy to read for the average person, with soft white paper that let the black ink of the extremely carefully transcribed text stand out. It looked possibly to have been written by some sort of automaton; the letters were perfectly formed, so either it was done by something with inhuman precision, or it was done with such slow and excruciating attention to detail that the people who do this work must scream in abject terror if their hands slip while working.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
As she finished reading the book, she paused and stared at it. That was...not super helpful. It did give some insights, but she'd already been able to tell there was something wrong with her aura. It elaborated why she felt sick, but nothing about how to fix it. Grumbling, she closed the book and set it aside again, being careful not to do anything that might damage it at all. She also set it away from the remaining food and tea, just to make sure nothing happened to it. After doing that, she paused and then moved to toss it on the other bed, just for extra safety. The last thing she needed was Amelia yelling at her for damaging knowledge. Turning back to Star, she reached out to flip the towel over so the side on the top, surely cooler than the bottom side now, would be back down on Star's forehead. "I don't know how to help make your aura...not poisoned. Resonant again, instead of dissonant. She reached out to take Star's hand and squeezed it, trying to again reach out with her own. She didn't know what she was doing, but she did avoid doing the exact same thing she did last time in trying to just send energy into Star. This time, she was just trying to touch auras, intentionally mingle them, see if that helped at all. If Ellesandra's aura wasn't 'poisoned' so to speak, then perhaps she could take some of the poison or dissonance on herself instead. Or let her not dissonant aura help guide Star's aura back to normal. All of this was her just poking around, no idea what she was doing and being cautious so she didn't poke anything she wasn't supposed to or somehow hurt Star worse.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Poking around cautiously certainly would be something that had its purpose. The intention was there to seek the poison, to try to take it. Ellesandra might not have great control over their aura, but their aura remained an extension of themselves, and so too did it extend their intent. Star's aura, in turn, gave Ellesandra exactly what they were looking for. It was slow at first, subtle, hard to even notice. But then suddenly, and all at once, Ellesandra was subject to a flood of emotion shooting through the connection between her and Star. A surge of jealousy, formless and without cause or direction. But unlike other times where this bridge was established, there wasn't the clear divide between what was Ellesandra's emotion and what was Star's. It was just a surge of formless energy that shot into Ellesandra. A big, tight ball of jealousy without cause or outlet. Something that would make Ellesandra herself feel jealous. Except of...What, exactly? There was no answer. It had no direction or purpose. Instead, it was left to just exist within Ellesandra briefly. It wouldn't be able to last for longer than a handful of minutes, as it was not Ellesandra's own feelings, but for those dozen minutes or so, Ellesandra was left feeling jealous because of this spike of energy. It didn't need to belong to anything, specifically. But if there was something for Ellesandra to be jealous about, it easily reinforced that existing feeling for that brief period. Then, after it had expended its energy, the feeling faded, like it was never there, taking with it any exacerbated feelings that were shot into Ellesandra's heart because of it as well.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't expect the flood of jealousy. Not only had she been trying to actively avoid touching or peeking into what emotions Star had been feeling, but she also wasn't sure why Star would have felt jealous. Of course, her goal of finding whatever that 'poison' was, was her more focused goal, so when the jealous surged into her, she took a deep breath and reared back a little. Her eyes closed and the familiar sense of the jealousy sent a few memories through her. Of standing by and watching Marigold court different nobles for the sake of finding an appropriate partner for ruling. Of guarding Marigold while she was out on dates with them, and then being sent away and knowing damn well what was happening when she was. How it had eaten at her, but she never said anything. She'd always kept her practiced stoic face on, and unlike Star Marigold couldn't just see her emotions. The feeling subsided after a few moments and she opened her eyes. There was grief there again, the memories brought back by a feeling of jealousy bringing with it the accompanying grief and guilt. She clenched her jaw, pushing that down and again focusing on Star. "Why are you jealous?" This wasn't depression, rejection, like she'd been expecting. Ellesandra hadn't shown an ounce of interest in anyone since meeting Star, had she? She began playing memories back, thinking. No one had even come close to catching her eye, other than Star herself. There was...annoyance at Amelia, respect for Amara, comforting pity for Lissana - no interest in Morrun. Serenity had gained that type of protective desire, just like she had for Star, but there was no affection there. Maybe there had be physical attraction to a few people, was that what Star was jealous of? But she'd obviously been attracted to Star, too. Frustration now, and she looked over to Star, grumbling. "How do I fix jealousy I don't understand?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Unfortunately, Ellesandra's questions fell on deaf - or rather, unconscious - ears. The only clues Ellesandra had to work with was that the surge had caused them to rear back after only a momentary connection had formed. Could there be more to it? Or was that the whole story? Had taking that poison had any effect? Was that all of it, or just a dose? Questions without answers, entirely, as was the question of whether Star would get better on her own or not. Certainly still seemed possible, but whether inaction was the right call or risked making it worse remained impossible to discern with any certainty.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra waited a few moments after feeling that jealousy, watching Star, then sighed and reached out. Her hand once again placed on Star's forehead, and she began the same exact review as she did last time. Was the jealousy still there, was there more, or other feelings that were causing issues? or could she feel Star's aura to start to feel better? Either way, Ellesandra continued trying to pull any such 'poison' out of Star.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Some cursory examination of trying to assess how much or how little or how much had changed in terms of Star's condition revealed that despite 'taking' some of this poison emotion from Star, there was no discernable change in how much of it there was, or in Star's condition. Her condition was changing passively, though the complexity of it made it difficult to tell if it was getting better or worse. It was only...Different. The jealousy was still there, and once more would resonate into Ellesandra if she let it. But in an effort to find if there was more, not only would that jealousy intensify, it brought with it a host of connected emotion that would be harsh and draining for Ellesandra to feel. The expected depression, rejection, shame, embarrassment and associated feelings with what presumably was caused by Ellesandra saying the subject was off limits were all there, all able to surround Ellesandra's heart and grip it like razorwire. But the more Ellesandra tried to feel, the stronger each emotion became, and none of it seeming to really help Star by trying to 'take' the emotion. At the core of it all, however, was...Loneliness, and a gnawing sense of inadequacy. Being not good enough, feeling crippling loneliness, and each of the negative emotions feeding into one another. Star was shivering again, now, as Ellesandra explored these emotions, and in so doing exposed themselves to the formless tortures that shot into her own heart to seek out her own demons and force them to the surface. Of course, Ellesandra need only focus and shut out the emotion, or simply remove her hand, to make it stop and let it start to subside again.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra tensed as she began to feel more of the jealousy. She wanted to just push it away, bottle it up and ignore it, but she wasn't sure if that would hurt Star even more. As much as she wanted to do that, she wasn't willing to risk Star. She was comfortable repressing her own emotions; not those of Star's. There was a very brief ping in the back of her head, worry that with this connection Star might be able to see or read the emotional and memory responses that came with these, but it was pushed away as well. Making sure Star was okay was the priority, after all. Ellesandra was her guard, and she wasn't about to let some emotional distress bring her down. While Ellesandra was only experienced with protecting against physical threats, it obviously was still her job to protect against emotional ones. The next emotions were rough, as they continued to sit in her. The depression was familiar, and because of that was easily ignored. She didn't repress it, but she could fight through that pretty easily considering how she'd essentially been depressed for years herself. The rejection was never one that she'd felt personally, not from a relationship or romantic feeling anyways, so it hit hard. She'd never asked someone, or actively pursued someone, and had them push her away. So that feeling caused her to tense and her eyes to close, having to work through that as it tightened around her heart and...hurt. She wasn't Star, she didn't have the experience 'working' through emotions. Her jaw clenched and she resisted the urge to yank her hand away or break the connection. Shame and embarrassment were old friends, ones that she recognized and could handle even if they just added to the tightness in her chest. But the loneliness, slamming into her. The inadequacy. Both of these Ellesandra was also very familiar with, but they were so close to how she felt too. The feeling was enough to make Ellesandra's eyes tear up again, the need to be held, the loneliness and knowing that she alone was the cause for that loneliness. The feeling of inadequacy that came from failing her one job, to protect Marigold. It was wrapped up in all of the guilt, as well, and all of that came damn near close to moving the mountain and letting all of that feeling pour out. Ellesandra's jaw trembled for a moment, but she refocused her attention on Star's emotions, not her own. To focus on how Star was feeling, not their similar feelings in herself. And as the loneliness began to grip onto her heart, Ellesandra lowered herself so she lay atop Star, directly against her and tight, and she whispered. "You aren't alone, Star. I'm here." She whispered, and sent that intention through their link, as much as she could while trying not to break down under the emotions herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  With the storm of emotions, it might be difficult to tell what exactly was going on, or what caused what. But for whatever was happening, when Ellesandra laid on Star and whispered, and sent their will through their aura, the desire to make clear to Star that she wasn't alone, that Ellesandra was there for them, there was...A response. A striking of a chord between the two. And though there was no initial change in Star being unconscious, there was a strength that formed in Star's aura that resonated back to Ellesandra. A small burst of...Something. Something good. And sure enough, following that, after a few minutes, Star stirred. She squirmed a little, eyes tightening. Plenty of time for Ellesandra to react before Star ultimately opened her eyes again. Hazy and unfocused, she took a moment to take in her surroundings. Consciousness again returned to her, though she was likely still a little out of it.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra didn't move, even as she heard and felt Star starting to come to. Her hands were now on the bed on either side of Star, elbows pressing in. Her head was tilted down, eyes still teary at all of the feelings and the tightness that was in her chest. She was letting herself feel Star's emotions way more than she ever let herself feel hers, and of course they were bringing up all of the emotions she didn't let herself feel. Memories she didn't let herself think about usually, from watching Marigold walk into her private library with a young noble girl on her arm and giggling together, to the shame she'd felt multiple times in disappointing Sia or the times Marigold scolded her for being out with a cute lass and too 'noticeable' about it, the inadequacy she'd felt when kneeling in front of the King and Queen and knowing she'd failed them, to the feeling of utter loneliness when she set out on her own afterwards, the first few months crying herself to sleep because she knew she couldn't go back home. She didn't move, focused on pushing what she felt down, focused on trying to keep taking in any of those feelings from Star that remained and not breaking down herself. Her teeth ground together, and her breathing trembled. Her throat felt tight and the knot around her heart didn't seem to go away, even if Star pulled away their aura or how Ellesandra was feeling Star's own feelings. They had successfully awoken those feelings within Ellesandra, as well.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Once Star was truly awake and cognizant, her initial fluster at the position they were in, being very much under Ellesandra in what could easily be a compromising way, was dismissed instantly upon seeing the woman above her in such distress. Star was still very much feverish and broken up, but that didn't stop her from being herself. Tears welled in her own eyes. She wasn't really able to stop Ellesandra from doing what they were doing, though no amount of trying to 'take' Star's emotions in this moment was diminishing them from Star herself. Star still felt all of it, even if Ellesandra was now also feeling it. Star wasn't able to use her auramancy to augment her comforting presence, but...She still could reach a shaky hand up and gently cup Ellesandra's cheek, rubbing away any tears if any should form in Ellesandra's eye with her thumb, or just rubbing their cheek with it otherwise.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra jerked a bit away from the touch at first, surprised by Star moving and touching her cheek. But she relaxed into it after a moment, taking in a deep, shaky breath. "I." She started, took another breath, and finished with an irritated breath. "Hate. This. Emotional. Shit." She took a few more deep breaths before she moved off of Star. She didn't stop contact, though. Even as she pulled away, her hand moved down to touch Star's shoulder until they were lying side by side, and their shoulders touched naturally. Star might be awake, but she was not sure if their connection needed to be maintained to ensure Star didn't go back into that state. Her eyes closed and she lay her head back, trying to once again push down her own emotions that came up in tandem to Star's emotions, to box them all up again and put them back in the mountain where they belonged.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  In a more light hearted situation, Star might have smiled at those words. Found them to be the endearing words of a woman who was learning to deal with the complexities of their heart. But no. She was ill, and Ellesandra was genuinely upset. She didn't have much ability to really do much besides let Ellesandra lay beside her and let her hand drop back down to her side. Her breaths were slow and measured. "...I don't...Feel good..." she said quietly. That much was...Probably obvious.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra wanted to just sleep now. To just pretend this all was done, even if she had just napped. Yet with Star saying she didn't feel good, Ellesandra found herself sitting back up and turning over to her. The wet rag had been pushed off in her touching Star's forehead a few times, so she grabbed it and placed it on Star's head again. "What can I do for you? There's some veggies over here if you think you can hold down some food, or I can go get you some tea or some soup?" Ellesandra wasn't sure if this was still emotional feeling unwell, or physical feeling unwell. She hoped it was the latter, as she would feel more comfortable addressing that, but it wouldn't stop her from addressing the emotional, either. At the very least, focusing on taking care of Star would give her something to focus on rather than the clenching in her chest, which still hadn't gone away. The feeling of loneliness was the biggest one, one that she was struggling and failing to lock away.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently shook her head at the mention of food, looking a little queasy for it. But at the same time, she recognized that having a purpose, having something to do, helped Ellesandra. "Water.." she said softly. "Cold. Please.." she continued, her voice hoarse and weak. Something for her throat would be nice, though she was struggling far more with her own aura than any physical maladies. In a normal circumstance, she could just conjure water. But that, unlike her auramancy, was actually suppressed by the dampening field of Myst, much like her ability to access her pocket dimension of assorted things. Curiously, she wasn't looking at Ellesandra. She almost always looked at them when talking to them. But right now Star was just keeping her eyes focused on the ceiling now that the knight had rolled off her.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra took the option of something to do, grabbing the cup with the tea and moving to the bathroom. She'd pour the tea out and then fill the mug with cold water, rinsing it once before filling it again and then bringing the mug of cold water in. Quicker than going to get cold water herself from wherever it was Amara had gotten the food and drink from, and she didn't feel entirely comfortable leaving the room with Star so...off, still. She set the cold water next to the bed, but then sat down next to Star. She started to reach out to take Star's shoulder, but stopped, unsure if touching her would help or make things worse with how she was struggling with her own emotions right now. "Anything I can do?" She asked instead, letting Star tell her what was needed right now.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star tried to sit up, but gave up on that after about two attempts, finding her body too weak to support herself. The fever was thoroughly kicking her butt. She accepted the cup, though she had to awkwardly push her head up in an almost-sit-up to drink from it. A little struggling was evident, and after a few sips she fell back onto the pillow, setting the cup on the nightstand between the beds. She saw the plate, and how it had veggies left on it but not whatever else it was Ellesandra had eaten. That they had presumably saved them for her, if their earlier offer was anything to go on, inspired a storm of conflict in her where it normally would have just made her smile and be happy. Instead, her face twisted in all kinds of expressions from good to bad, and tears flowed freely. The microcosm of her current emotional state was that she was crying over a plate of cold, steamed vegetables. When Ellesandra asked the question, she gently shook her head, looking away from Ellesandra with an expression that could only be interpreted as 'hurt'.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
When Star struggled to raise up to drink water, Ellesandra would offer a light hand to support her back and neck while she did so, at least until she could get some water in her. Then, there was the silence after, the light shaking of her head, the tears. And then looking away from her, obviously hurt. Ellesandra didn't know what to do, and was far out of her depth. Her first instinct was to go to what had helped Star when she was struggling before, which had been to wrap her arms around Star and hold her, but something told her that may not be entirely welcome right now. She stayed there quiet for a second, but then she decided to let Star decide. Stepping away without offering it to Star might be worse than offering and letting Star decide it wasn't what would help right now. So, Ellesandra held an arm out to Star. For her to turn into and lean into Ellesandra, should she choose to. And in addition, Ellesandra whispered softly - "I'm not going to leave you, Star. You won't be alone." She said that, knowing that that loneliness was not entirely what Star's loneliness stemmed from. It stemmed from Ellesandra shutting her emotions for Star away. But that wasn't something Ellesandra was prepared to offer right now, so she could offer her companionship for now at least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  There was a response to those words that bubbled up in Star's throat. She nearly said it, but...Couldn't. It was the poisonous, festering emotions in her that were making her want to say those things, to tell Ellesandra off and tell her that offering to not leave only after she had a meltdown but being perfectly fine to just up and run away whenever else they wanted not giving a damn for how it hurt her was just not how the world worked, and them feeling bad about it now was their own damn fault...The spite in her heart, that part of her saying to say that, and spit it, and make Ellesandra hurt, and make them suffer, and make them sad...That wasn't her. That. Was not. Star. So she sucked that bile back down, visibly tightening her face for a moment. She repeated it to herself. That was her pain talking. She didn't actually want that. The vision of Ellesandra crying as she yelled at them - even if the more likely result was that Ellesandra would just put on a scowl and it'd turn into a shouting fest - was more than enough to keep her vile emotions from getting the best of her. So she slowly leaned the other way and accepted Ellesandra's companionship, head tucked under their chin. And when she did so, a genuine flutter of relief entered her chest. Shaky hands moved to latch onto Ellesandra's shoulders, and then the tears began to fall. Misty-eyed before, she was now at the point of actually letting herself feel the emotions again, and it hurt. So came the choked sobs that only made her head pound even harder. There were things she needed from Ellesandra to actually get over any of these emotions fully but...She hadn't the emotional capacity to get into them at the moment. She just needed comfort, made obvious by the way she latched onto the knight when they offered their support. She was upset, of course. But she put aside the pain so she could reinforce to Ellesandra that no matter how much she was hurting, she wanted them here with her, just like this.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra could tell, even not being good at emotions, that Star wasn't just 'okay' now that she'd woken up. It wasn't all better. She didn't know what to say though, and just kept hat arm out until Start turned into it. And then she pulled Star into her, the choked sobs seeming to shoot a pang of guilt and her own pain through Ellesandra, yet she said nothing about it. There was an acceptance, knowing that their own actions were what caused this, knowing their own emotional unavailability had been what pushed Star this far. That she'd hurt Star by pushing her emotions down. THAT much was obvious. How to go forward from here - well, that wasn't. She instead focused on the current moment, pulling Star against her and moving her other hand to lightly run through Star's hair, offering that same comfort that Star had offered them earlier. Ellesandra had cried more in the past few days than she had in years, yet it seemed like her and Star just kept doing that. She held Star and offered what comfort she could, and something Star might notice was - she wasn't keeping her barrier up. Oh, she was doing what she could to prevent Star from feeling the extent of her guilt at the situation, but she was open to Star's aura, since that had seemed to help her come out of it. She was still trying not to feel Star's emotions, to not pry into those, but holding Star and opening herself where she could - she was trying at the very least.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star's aura was still discordant. The emotional walls weren't open and flowing freely like they normally were. So unless Ellesandra was specifically diving in and trying to focus on her, there would just be...Nothing. Just like holding a normal, non-auramancer woman. The evidence and emotion and all the rest was there to find, but wasn't offering itself freely. For having it be present for so long, it might be odd not being able to 'feel' Star. But whatever the case, it remained the nothing was 'okay', and the silence of Star's aura was one worrisome symptom of that fact. For now...She cried. And unless Ellesandra had more to do, or something to say, she'd just cry until she was too tired of crying. And eventually, she would pass out again if nothing else was done.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	She didn't say or change anything, despite how much it made her worried with not being able to feel Star. Normally, this would have been a relief; not having to worry about Star's emotions overwhelming her or Star seeing too much of her own emotions was ideal, in usual circumstances. Right now, though, it was just even more concerning than normal, though. She held Star as she sobbed and cried, and even continued to hold Star as she passed out. Ellesandra hoped this time it had been physical exhaustion, just crying herself into sleep, but she silently kicked herself for letting Star pass out again either way. She should have asked what was going on, asked how she could help. She didn't let go of Star even afterwards, at least not at first. As Star continued to rest though, Ellesandra leaned down and, without thinking, pressed her lips to the top of Star's head. A gentle, soft kiss, reassuring and comforting, and it was quickly pulled away with Ellesandra lightly pulling out of the bed and leaving Star to rest. She stood next to the bed, looking down at her with her heart pounding and very conflicting emotions swirling through her. Her heart still ached, her chest tight with the feel of the loneliness that persisted, as well as seeing Star hurt like this. Was it better to let her hurt now, and then recover and go on as friends at most for the journey? She thought so, but she wasn't sure if Star would agree right now. Ellesandra was too scared to admit anything else. A sigh, and she looked towards the door, then back to Star, before just sitting back down on the bed. She couldn't bring herself to leave the mage right now, so at the very least she'd stay there with her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star certainly had nothing to contribute to the decision making process. However, Ellesandra would feel a spark of something when they leaned in to kiss the top of Star's head. A spark of life, of that familiar resonance with Star. It pulsed and produced a small measure of...Normalcy. That calm. That serene feeling that was familiar to Star's aura. A sign that the gesture helped. Not that kissing her was the answer, it obviously wasn't. There was layer upon layer of emotional complexity that made such romantic gestures problematic. But while Star was out cold? The little affection was reaching her, doing what words couldn't. Comforting her. It let her rest a little more calmly. Time would tell after she rested if she would wake on her own and get back towards some semblance of normal again, or if more permanent damage had been done.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra wouldn't kiss more, having not been entirely sure it was the right thing to do considering she had no intention to follow up and do more with it. Still, after sitting down, having felt that literal spark from the brief kiss to the top of her head, Ellesandra couldn't just leave her. Instead, she moved to lay down next to Star again, snuggling up close so that Star could cuddle into her. She closed her eyes, but she didn't try to drift to sleep. No, she reached out once again, to try to see if Star's aura still felt so off, or if it seemed like it was doing better. Even if it wasn't being actively shared with Ellesandra anymore, if she could get some kind of reassurance this was just a physical rest now, that would make her feel a lot more comfortable just cuddling against Star for, if she were honest with herself, both of their comfort.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Star's aura was still ultimately far too complex for Ellesandra to really understand, there were reassuring signs. There were flickers of the familiar resonance. After the time and comfort that had been provided, and some time for Star to cry, her aura felt more...Whole? Whole felt right. Where it was broken before, some amount of it was mended again. It pointed more towards Star just being exhausted than being comatose, and though the comforts of cuddling were too slow, too subtle to feel in real-time, the comfort seemed to be the only thing that was doing any good. Though Star's magic was about as complex as complex could get, it seemed, truly, that the answer for this malady required no special actions beyond what one might otherwise do anyway to help someone who was ill, while also nursing a wounded and vulnerable heart in the process. Ellesandra was certainly good at...At least one of those things.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra relaxed some once she felt Star was doing...'better' at least. She was obviously not 'fixed' or 'healed' or completely okay, but it was a good step to making Ellesandra comfortable that she WOULD get better. She pulled her exploration back, uncomfortable with it now that she knew Star would be fine and it wasn't necessary to help. She didn't want to be invasive, even if Star probably wouldn't consider it such. She did just cuddle Star after that, eyes closed, but thinking to herself what the hell she was doing. Why was she cuddling someone to comfort them? She hadn't cuddled someone like this in...ever? She'd cuddled Marigold a few times, but that hadn't been the same. She enjoyed cuddling Star, even if it simultaneously made her uncomfortable with allowing the closeness. Still, allowing that closeness was so much easier when it was to comfort Star - not the other way around. Ellesandra wouldn't sleep again, but she would continue to cuddle Star. Simply laying there, holding her, and watching the room, letting her thoughts take hold and using that time to help control her emotions. To cage up that loneliness and get rid of it, to cage up that inadequacy, and all of the emotions that feeling Star's emotion had dragged up. She wanted to put them back down, act like they didn't exist once again, to prevent them from coming back up. Of course she knew Star would disagree, Ellesandra felt like she was already giving enough right now. She was stepping so far out of her comfort zone, pushing herself more out of it and letting herself truly experience those emotions wouldn't be productive right now.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Ellesandra did not sleep, Star did. And while unconscious, she moved from the position she had taken huddled up against Ellesandra to one that more fully embraced her desires. Hands shifted to slide around Ellesandra instead of resting on their shoulders. Her hold was tender and weak, but an unconscious product of her want to be close and to hold the woman before her. And if that wasn't enough, one leg pushed, trying to snake between both of Ellesandra's legs so that they would tangle up. Of course, Star wasn't consciously doing these things, and was weaker than her already delicate self due to the fever, so it wouldn't be hard for Ellesandra to control what Star was doing. But if they weren't going to stop her, Star's unconscious mind was going to try and settle them into a cuddle that was a whole lot more like how two lovers would cuddle up than how two friends might. Regardless of this, Star was sure to be out for quite a few hours unless woken, and it seemed whatever Amara wanted to talk about was taking a rain check given what had happened to Star.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra felt a bit of discomfort when Star wrapped her arms around her, but she'd frozen when Star slid her leg between Ellesandra's. That touch, that position ignited a desire, a need for more of it, along with an extreme discomfort for this with Star. This wasn't a bit of cuddling after a no strings attached romped. This was the cuddling of someone who truly cared for and wanted to be as close as possible to Ellesandra. After a moment of seeing it Star would wake or pull away, and her not doing so, Ellesandra lightly moved to reposition her own legs so that Star's was not between them. She did not push Star's embrace away, but the leg between hers wasn't something she felt comfortable allowing right now. As Star slept, Ellesandra worked through the remaining emotions that were gnawing at her. It was after a few hours that she finally felt comfortable and well enough, emotionally, to not have to be fighting the pain and loneliness around her heart actively. She glanced down at Star and took in a deep breath. Sleeping. She leaned in and pressed her lips to the top of Star's forehead, right where her head met skin, and then pulled away and began to withdraw herself from the embrace entirely. Ellesandra would never dare kiss Star's head while Star was awake, as it would beg questions and comments and hopes in Star. But while she was asleep, and just to soothe her aura? She could let herself do that. It wasn't as if the kiss wasn't meant, even if Ellesandra might be lying to herself about that. Upon pulling herself out from Star's embrace, lightly getting out of bed and trying to do so without waking star at all, she muttered. "Getting you some food." Just in case Star did wake up and notice Ellesandra pulling away or getting out of bed, she didn't jump to the wrong conclusion. It was with that, that Ellesandra slipped out of the room, closing the door softly behind her, and headed down to the guild hall to see if she could find where it was Amara had brought the food in from earlier.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star had some unconscious fussing about the loss of the warmth, closeness, and pressure of their legs being intertwined. Just a little sleepy groan of protest. But her sleepy figure didn't repeat the action. Then the kiss to her forehead evoked a happier sound as she squeezed a little closer. And of course, more sleepy protests as Ellesandra slipped away. She was too weak to stop them, but when Ellesandra did actually pull away, she made the vain attempt to pull them back before her arms fell limp on the bed. No wakefulness to be found from Star. Were she healthy, she might have noticed the departure and woke. But nope, out cold still. When Ellesandra departed, the guild hall was, perhaps unsurprisingly, fairly logical and 'square' in its layout. A grid of hallways made getting from one place to another fairly straight forward, if a bit soulless. It was meant to be efficient, not beautiful, though the decoration and adornments in the way of paintings, presumably of past important guild members, did inject some beauty to the cold grid of lodging. There was quite a lot to this place; there didn't seem to be an end to the ways Ellesandra could go deeper into the guild hall, but that didn't seem to be the right way to go. Back towards the main foyer where there had once been a small army of guild members sitting among the tables, there was now maybe a dozen people still awake and arranged into a few small groups. Most had weapons, though naturally those weapons were sheathed. Either returning from or about to head out onto some venture, perhaps. The foyer did have the bar where others had been seen eating, however, and it proved to be staffed with someone who would be able to provide Ellesandra a menu. Standard fare for a kitchen like this one, though there was an emphasis on discounted meals that were more bulk in nature. Whole chickens or turkeys with a whole feast of food to go with it were priced quite well for the amount of food that was on offer. With how many mouths there clearly were to feed, it seemed the goal was to get people to dine all together in communal meals rather than everyone get individual portions. Easier for the chefs to make bulkier servings than it would be to make individual plates for each guild member, so it stood to reason it was mutually beneficial. However, for a girl with a bird stomach like Star who was also sick and probably would struggle to keep anything down, Ellesandra was doubtlessly going to be drawn instead to the smaller fare, which while wasn't offered with such discount as the bulk meals, was a fair price. In particular, the soups were only a single copper piece per bowl. With the funds they had, if Ellesandra didn't mind soup every day they could manage to subsist off food at that price for quite a long time. Sure beat hard tack, at least. Also on the menu were salads, balanced plates like the one Amara got for Ellesandra, and a variety of desserts, some of which included ingredients that would be alien to the knight. Even some of the meats - while 'dragon steak' was obvious, just what was a 'trennabar flank'? Drinks were plentiful in choice, both alcoholic and not, with some easily recognized, others bearing strange names that had some colourful and fun descriptions that might be tempting in happy times, but water, tea, mead, milk, and various fruit juices were plentiful. Spoiled for choice in what to bring back to Star, though as delightful as it might be to bring Star a sweet blueberry crumble, she likely would need to recover from her strange illness before she could stomach solid food, even if it was her favourite berry.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra appreciated the efficiency of the place, even if part of her missed an artistic touch. It was her military mind that loved the very square, orderly designs, but beyond that? The place seemed boring and dull, architecturally, and Ellesandra would never say she actually liked the look of a building like this. They weren't asking her for her architectural opinion though, nor was she qualified to give any real feedback, so she went through and found where the bar was. A glance was given around the bar at everyone in it, apparent guild members, and silently thanked Amara and Amelia for setting them up here for the night at least, if not a few nights. She scanned the menu, eyes pausing on the desserts and then the salads. If Star was feeling well, she would have gotten her a nice chicken salad with strawberries and a blueberry dessert, but the idea of a sick Star eating a salad just didn't seem right. Salads were healthy, but not exactly comfort healing foods. So she focused on the soups section; much cheaper, but also probably the best thing for Star right now. Get her liquids in, and it wouldn't be too much on her stomach. She searched for one that had a little bit of meat in it along with mostly vegetables. Something like maybe some beef with carrots and such in it. At the very least, the beef broth of the soup would help, and she was sure to get a soup that had multiple forms of vegetables in there, not just meat, for Star. She did, however, ask to get some fruit on the side. If they had the option of asking for blueberries specifically she would; even if Star wasn't up to eating them right now, blueberries would be fine to sit out for a few hours or even overnight and would be a good snack if Star woke up later and was feeling like she could stomach some solid foods easier. She pulled out the group fund bag she'd brought out with her to pay, and then would head back up to their room, assuming she wasn't stopped or waylaid by Amara or Amelia or anyone, to place the food on the table beside Star and lightly put a hand to her arm to try to wake her.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  No interruptions would be found on this night. The beef and vegetable soup was about as common as soups could be, right next to tomato and chicken soups. So it was, a healthy portion that was probably more than a sick Star was able to handle at the moment was given with the side of blueberries. The bartender had a brief pause at what he found to be a fairly non-standard combination but he didn't ask questions nor did he linger on it. Just a 'huh' moment before doing his job. He had the same fluffy ears on his head that Amelia and Amara had. That trait seemed to be somewhat common in Myst, with some of the other guild members sporting the same. Ears, but no tails. Not something that was ever really seen elsewhere. Truly, before meeting Amara and Amelia, there had only been one person Ellesandra had met with such features, but they hadn't said a word about Myst. Furry sights aside, Star was roused after a few attempts at doing so, the first touch or two didn't seem to be enough. But a gentle few nudges would get her sleepily opening her eyes and looking curiously up at Ellesandra, clearly on the verge of just...Passing back out if not compelled to wake up fully.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra would lightly push and gently shake Star until she woke. Part of her wanted to just let Star sleep, let her recover on her own, but she hadn't eaten anything since that morning before the fighting had happened, and she'd used her magic two major times that day. Ellesandra was worried that if she didn't get food in her, the mage might just waste away into magical dust. Not literally of course, but still. When Star did begin to wake, even if it was on the verge of passing back out, Ellesandra lightly tugged her over to look at the side table. "Come on, let me help you sit up and see if we can't get some food in you, Star. Try a few spoonful's of the soup at least, and there's some blueberries as a reward if you think you can stomach them right now." Ellesandra wasn't exactly a motherly instinct kinda gal; she was trying to compromise and offer, rather than ordering Star, but it wasn't coming naturally. She wanted to just tell Star to sit up and eat, as an order, but there was no world in which she thought that would actually be helpful for Star. "If you need, I can sit next to you to help you with the strength to sit up." She offered, as if that might convince Star if she was being held and actively supported by Ellesandra.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though it wasn't coming naturally to Ellesandra, the tender, gentle, kind way that the knight was bringing Star to come up and eat was proving exceptionally effective. She didn't fuss, and she gently nodded with a quiet 'uh-huh' at the offer of Ellesandra sitting next to her. There was a quiet, sleepy smile on her lips as she was cared for in this way. The soup would be helpful in restoring her strength, but, as it was with this auramancer, the emotional bond, reassurance, and kindness was perhaps even more nourishing than food ever could be. So despite still being very much feverish to the touch, Star managed to have strength enough to get the food into her. Slowly, steadily, she did as she knew she had to. It was more motions of necessity than pleasure, putting the food in her because she had to rather than to enjoy it, though the quality was certainly still good. Not a gourmet soup by any measure, but one would struggle to find a complaint about it. Rich broth, good choice of complementary vegetables. Certainly worth more than was charged for, but perhaps that was a perk of guild membership, even if Star nor Ellesandra belonged to the Followers of Myst. Special circumstance had them enjoying the benefits all the same, regardless. Star, as expected, wouldn't be able to finish it all, giving up after about three quarters were eaten. At that point, she laid her head on Ellesandra's shoulder, lightly panting through her lips. Just the simple act of eating was exhausting. Despite this, she still grabbed a blueberry between index finger and thumb and nibbled on it. Oh, how she wanted to enjoy them all. But she looked ready to pass out again while leaning on her companion. A reassuring sign, however, would come as she rest against Ellesandra. A few sparks of connection. The familiar feeling of their auras intertwining and the bond restoring. A sign that Star was healing, though it did come with the realization that the resonant connection between them wasn't permanently broken. It would be right back to fighting to separate their emotions each time they touched once Star was back to full health.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra was pleased that Star agreed to sit up and eat. She did move to sit next to star, arm around Star's back to help support her up, and even to support her head if it looked like Star needed it. Ellesandra didn't go so far as to help feed Star, not unless it was absolutely necessary, but she did seem to be getting more comfortable with general touching since she was just casually holding Star up and against her, as needed. She didn't speak as Star ate, instead just watching to make sure she was eating alright and not having any issues or risking spilling the soup all over herself. As she finished, Ellesandra didn't push for her to eat more; three quarters of it was more than she'd expected Star to eat to begin with. A smile threatened when seeing that she did eat one of the blueberries, but as Star moved to lay her head against Ellesandra, she reached out for the cup of water from earlier. Bringing it up, she'd reach out and lightly tip Star's head up by the chin to ensure that Star got at least a little water in her, too. The soup was surely decent for hydration, but water was also important. She wouldn't force much, just enough to ensure Star wet her lips, before setting it back down to the side and turning back to Star. "Lay back down. I'll get a fresh rag to place on your head for the fever." She was a little worried that Star still obviously looked sick. Perhaps the poison hadn't all been brought out? Or if it had, maybe it was just a side effect? Either way, Star was awake now, so it was progress, but it still created obvious concern in her if Star looked for her feelings again.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star did drink, and though she was still recovering she did drink more than Ellesandra might expect. Star was always pushing herself, even when she was sick. But for once, pushing herself to do things that would in the long run make her healthier was a good thing. She wasn't going so far as to make herself retch, but she clearly knew what she needed to do, even if it was hard. Being told to lay down had her nod and slowly do as asked. She watched Ellesandra as they moved about, not saying much but wearing an...Uncertain expression. Given this all was happening because of her emotional state, it stood to reason that she had a lot of things on her mind she was sorting through, though she wasn't about to speak up. There simply seemed to just be...A lot of things that would need to be talked about once Star was better, a future Ellesandra undoubtedly couldn't wait to see realized.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Oh, Ellesandra couldn't wait until Star felt better, but she very much COULD wait to have those discussions later. There was honestly a fear of them, afraid she would say or do something that would cause this to get worse. A fear that she didn't want to let things happen that felt more and more like they were going to anyways. Ellesandra set all of the food and drink to the edge of the table, so Star wouldn't accidentally knock them off, and then took the rag and moved into the bathroom to make it damp and wring it out again. She came back and then moved up to Star, lightly patting the rag across her sweat dampened forehead and face, before moving to place the rag across the forehead itself. After doing so, Ellesandra moved to lay in bed next to Star, not even needing to be asked to know that the physical comfort of cuddling was needed for Star. Whether that was just friendly cuddles or not, it would help some. So, she would immediately lay against the mage, not meeting her eyes, and saying - "You should get more rest now." As if Star needed the order.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	Star gently grabbed at Ellesandra's wrist before they pulled away after laying the rag on her forehead. She brought their wrist to her cheek and just...Pressed into it, eyes briefly closing. She didn't keep this held long, just long enough to have...A moment. A moment of enjoying Ellesandra's hand on her cheek. She released once she had the moment she needed, then obliged once Ellesandra set up near her again. Sleep was quick to come to her, and this time she would be asleep through the night until morning, unless woken.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra had frozen when Star grabbed her wrist, holding it to her cheek. She didn't know how to respond to this, just let Star hold it there with an awkward, unsure air about her as it happened. When it was released, and then they proceeded to cuddle again and Ellesandra heard Star properly drift off into sleep, She tried to do so herself. Between all of the naps though, she wasn't tired. Ellesandra lay with Star for a while, giving her the comfort of the physical touch while there, but after about an hour or so of doing that Ellesandra was getting restless. She didn't want to keep moving around on the bed and unintentionally wake Star, even if Star would have preferred the cuddling, so she turned and slid out of bed softly. Ellesandra didn't feel comfortable leaving the room so instead she moved over to the corner, taking her rapier off of her waist and laying it on what was supposed to have been Star's bed, but was apparently turning into her own bed - or the 'spare bed' since they'd been cuddling most of the time. Ellesandra went through stretches, working out the stiffness that she'd gotten from all of the laying down that day, and feeling the minor strain she'd had from the very brief haste spell she'd cast before. Then, Ellesandra began workouts. Push ups, crunches, stretches, everything really except cardio because she didn't know of a way to do that without potentially waking Star. She kept herself busy, finishing basic work outs and then going through slow motion rapier practice - something she hadn't done in a longer period of time than she'd care to admit. It was a way to focus on her physical body, to feel all of herself, and to help push the emotions out of the way. When doing this, she was a physical creature, one without emotions, one which followed the orders of her brain and maintained slow, steady motions to practice control that was second nature. She did eventually come back to bed to sleep again, after a brief shower to rinse the sweat off and replacing the rag once again on Star's forehead. She'd originally looked between the empty bed and Star's, but had chosen to sleep cuddled against start considering how much that had been helping her before. And once again, in her sleep, she would completely unconsciously cuddle much closer and more intimately than she might have while awake, her unconscious body emulating the exact same type of cuddling that Star had tried to do earlier.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Just as the night before, it was once more proven that the influence of things on Ellesandra's dreams to pull her into lucidity had now power or sway here in Myst. More natural dreams were theirs to have, though cuddled up against Star naturally ensured that Star's influence was still present. It was not visions of Star in peril this time, but rather dreams that emulated reality. Star in need of care. Star in need of Ellesandra in many ways. Ways that began with simple acts of service, moving to cuddles and emotional comforts, to some moments of romantic tension as dream logic dictated the only way to properly heal Star was to kiss her, and depending on how Ellesandra's unconscious mind might react, a bit more than kiss - though as Ellesandra had never actually seen Star in a state of undress, the dream would fail to emulate such visions. The dreams remained under the command of Ellesandra's whims and desires and unconscious processes, so whatever happened remained a reflection of their own heart. And Star remained none the wiser to whatever it may evolve into. However, Star was unconsciously receptive to the intimate cuddles, so when Ellesandra would again wake in the morning, assuming nothing stirred them out of sleep prior, the two were a tangle of bodies that befit strongly bound lovers. Her smooth, shapely legs entangled with the knight's. Her arms around them. The softness of her chest against theirs, and her head tucked under their chin where she felt oh so very safe. And naturally, Star was unlikely to wake before Ellesandra. But come morning, Star would feel decidedly less feverish. A bit warm now, but the worst had passed, and her recovery was now all but guaranteed.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra's dreams started out...'normal'. They started out with her taking care of Star, typical from what she'd been doing that day during waking hours. They moved into hugs, cuddles, and then there was a kiss. In her dream, Star had initiated the kiss - but Ellesandra had not pulled away. She'd frozen, then returned it. Yet, when she opened her eyes and pulled away from the kiss, it wasn't Star she was seeing. It was Marigold's face, blood trickling down from her hairline, ghost-dead eyes staring at Ellesandra, and whispering - "Are you going to let yourself love a charge again, Ellie?" The fear that was holding her back, that despite the desire and affection there was, Ellesandra was terrified of the potential outcome. Needlessly to say, Ellesandra jerked awake. She even made a soft cry as she did, the formless noise coming from her throat more one of alarm than it was of any substance. She froze as the real world came back around her, looking around. She found herself pressed up against Star, leg raised and allowing Star's between her own, arms snaked around Star's body entirely and Star pressed right up against Ellesandra's chest. The type of protective hold to comfort, with no barriers for what was 'appropriate'. She stayed very still to see if she had woken Star in her rude awakening, and if there was no stirring or waking, she would slowly begin to slip back, out of her embrace. Enough to sit up, then move away, leaning against the door and breathing heavily, eyes closed with the memory of the dream - how nice it was, and then how it ended.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Though Star was quite dead to the world for the past while, the sudden shock and then jerking awake with the noise was enough to rouse Star. She took notice of the posture the two had assumed during the night, though said nothing to comment about it. Her fever was broken, the time was just before sunrise, not that either could really know that given the windowless room they were in that was illuminated by magical lanterns that were turned on and off with small metal dials, but also were programmed to slowly brighten at sunrise and naturally dim at night to simulate the cycle of a day passing. So it was, the room was on the passage to lightening again, slowly over the next hour or so. Star wouldn't stop Ellesandra from retreating, though she did sit up and rub at one eye sleepily once they did. Concern was writ on her face, though she didn't immediately speak up.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	Ellesandra didn't say anything at first, just leaning her back against the door and keeping her eyes closed, doing her best to push Marigold's dead face out of her mind. That had been a rather rude awakening compared to what had been a very pleasant dream. She'd remember her hands on Star's waist, sliding up beneath her shirt - and then that. Her breathing was still heavy, and when she finally opened her eyes and looked to Star, obviously concerned, Ellesandra shook her head. "Bad...dream." It was, though Ellesandra also had no desire to explain what was bad about it. That she'd been kissing Star in her dream, that she'd been well on the way to doing more with Star, and not just from lust either. She cleared her throat and grumbled under her breath, then focused her attention back on Star. Taking care of Star, that would distract her right? "How are you feeling? Up to breakfast, if I go get you anything?"
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star gently nodded to the answer. It explained things, and she didn't see the need to press them on it. Everyone had bad dreams. She would want to know about it, sure, but she reserved her desire to push Ellesandra on things to things she considered important, while trying to respect their boundaries on all other things. A conflicting desire to grow closer, while also respecting Ellesandra's want for privacy. She nodded again to the notion of breakfast. "Mmn. I think I am okay to stomach solid food again," she said, looking over at the table for the blueberries. She reached over and grabbed a handful, which was most of them, and began to munch on them, but not before she added another comment: "...Thank you, Ellesandra. For taking care of me." A notion punctuated by her popping some of the blueberries into her mouth, one at a time.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded, relief coming through her that Star was saying full sentences again, and seemed to be doing much better. She took a deep breath again, shaking her head to shake the memory of Marigolds face out of her mind, then shoved off of the door and made her way over to the plates and cup from the night before. She ensured that Star had gotten any and all of the blueberries she'd wanted before picking them all up to take them downstairs with her when she went. "Do you want something like eggs and hash, or would you be interested in something like pancakes with berries? I'm not sure what all you're ready for, food wise. And do you prefer orange juice or some other juice?" She'd seen Star drink orange juice at Morrun's, but that was the only juice she'd had the opportunity to see Star drink, so it was best to ask and see what she actually preferred.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  	All of the blueberries Star wanted was ALL of them, so, they were all taken and held in her open palm before allowing the precious berries be taken away. Being asked about her preferences was nice. "I've gotten my blueberries so probably best I have something more hardy, so I don't gorge on sweets. Orange juice is fine. It goes well with most things. But any berry or fruit juice or lemonade or tea is fine, really. I'm not picky." A smile was given. Though her life didn't revolve around food, it was still nice to be able to talk about this stuff with Ellesandra. "What about you? I know you like meats so, if you get something with meat for us, you can most of mine." She didn't want to go holding Ellesandra up to have a whole lengthy conversation about this while they were just trying to get an order together, but she figured maybe they could talk about it more when the knight got back. A less heavy topic to start the day felt right, something to keep her mind away from the poison emotions festering in her chest.
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
	That was exactly why she'd made sure Star got what she wanted before taking them away. She knew the woman loved her blueberries. A nod was given in regards to the order, shrugging at the return question. "I like some meats. I'm not against other foods, Star. Meat is just easiest." Unlike salads and things that you had to work to make it taste good, meats just...tasted. And they were relatively healthy for a working body. Having an idea of what to get, she'd take their dishes downstairs and find wherever it was best to place them, whether there was a section to the side for them or if she would just bring them up to the bar. She'd only glance briefly around the guild hall again before moving up to the bar to place an order for whatever standard breakfast platter they had. She would get a side of fruits for Star despite her mentioning needing more; always best for her to have the extra option and it wasn't like they were hurting for coin considering the price of the stew yesterday. And orange juice for them both. Assuming she wasn't stopped at all on her way back up, she'd balance the plates and drinks up like a...pro, honestly. She carried them like a waitress would, the only difference being a concern about putting too much of the balance or weight on her right arm. She walked upstairs gracefully despite this, and would lightly tap her foot on their bedroom door for Star to come open it for her. easier than setting anything down to open it herself.
</p>
  
<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">
  Star considered this new information about how Ellesandra thought about food while pensively chewing on a blueberry. She would discover the secrets of Ellesandra's culinary preferences yet. But for now, she waited. There was a bustle of activity, and a bit of a line forming for breakfast in the guild hall. But it seemed this was common, as in place of one person to take orders, there were four behind the spacious wooden counter. Orderly shuffling as people got their orders in, and a few people coming out with orders and calling out names to get people to pick up their plates progressed, and as time passed, more of a flood of breakfast-wanters came out of their dorms. The kitchen was unseen behind a set of large doors, but peeking in when it was opened would reveal the kitchen behind to be quite large, with brass appliances, knobs, and flashes of magic to be seen as the work to feed the legions of hungry bellies was underway. Efficiency was the name of this place in many respects, and this was no different. A careful eye for the food coming out would reveal it came out exactly the same each time. Each breakfast platter, assuming no custom orders were put in, came out looking identical to the last, save for minor amounts of shuffling of ingredients in transit, and minor differences in the sear marks on cooked foods. They also came out with almost disturbingly identical intervals. So each breakfast platter that was prepared arrived exactly two minutes eighteen seconds from the last one. The chefs working the kitchen were certainly human, but the truth of the matter was that a magical automation system was at their command to process this all with such mechanical precision. It didn't affect the taste of the food at all, of course. But for one unaccustomed to this, it might be a touch strange. No familiar faces showed themselves, with Amara and Amelia either being earlier risers or later sleepers than the knight was this morning. So when they got back to the room, Star moved with only a minor languid hamper to her gait to open the door and help take some of the things from Ellesandra so they needn't struggle to place things down. She certainly took note of their posture, though she had assumed Ellesandra was trained in court etiquette, being a knight. Star was not. But she still had nice table manners, at least. When there was a table, anyway. Sitting on a bed with her plate left less room to be prim and proper. She began into her food once they were all set up, flashing a smile seeing that Ellesandra had brought some fruit along as well, but saw fit to make a little conversation. "So. Do you have favourite foods? Things you really like? I get the sense a lot of what you do is driven by just what is easiest and most effective, but now I'm wondering if you secretly have a sweet tooth."
</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
Ellesandra nodded in thanks when Star opened the door for her, bringing the food in and setting it all up properly before sitting on the bed across from Star. For the first time since yesterday, creating some distance between them really. She moved the book that had been borrowed to again ensure it didn't get damaged at all, before starting on her food with silent contentment. She'd eyed Star for a moment to ensure Star had the strength to eat fine and didn't need her assistance like she had last night, but confirming she was fine Ellesandra began eating. At the question, she shrugged. "I do, I guess." Things she hadn't really had in years, because she'd have to seek them out. Things you didn't exactly get just at taverns here and there or while cooking for yourself on the road. After a moment, knowing that Star wouldn't leave it at Ellesandra agreeing that she did, she added. "There's a plum flavored ale I enjoy, though I don't drink much ale anymore. And food wise, I enjoy roast with carrots, or a nice poached duck." An odd combination of basic hearty food, and something that was obviously more fancy. Even the ale was something that was fancy compared to some base taverns. She could probably find something similar ale wise here, but she was also on duty; she wasn't about to let herself get drunk on ale while in a strange land with her charge. "Not that I dislike meat, it's easy to cook and good to eat. So if you prefer fruits and veggies still, I'm happy to split that down the middle like we have been."
</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star enjoyed the discussion. She knew Ellesandra hated small talk, but this felt more personal. She liked the feeling of bonding with Ellesandra, or with anyone in general really - but Ellesandra specifically. So this was a nice thing to keep her feeling like the two were able to just talk and enjoy one another's company, even if there was nothing wrong with comfortable silence, without annoying the other. "I'm not supposed to drink ale," she said, but still thought about the answer. "I'm sure we could find that drink for you sometime, if we have somewhere safe to be for a while." She knew from her earlier comment about Ellesandra and her splitting up that they didn't feel that way about Myst, so she left it at some vague 'maybe sometime if we feel like it probably' proposition. She did nod to the notion of splitting the food. "Like you it's not that I dislike meat, but sometimes those sit heavy in my stomach and make me feel lazy." She paused, looking over at the book Ellesandra had on what was the bed she was using before. Was that one of the tomes about her home? She didn't ask, but did seem curious about it. "I don't think I've ever had duck."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra tilted her head at the idea of Star drinking ale. She raised her eyebrows, but didn't ask why. It was likely to do with something about emotions getting wild. perhaps Wine would do the same thing? She wasn't sure, but she couldn't imagine a drunk Star. Someone who could literally see emotions having low inhibitions sounded...like a bad idea. And who knew how it would effect Star's emotions themselves. She considered the idea of finding the ale and shook her head. "No need." Star was just trying to be helpful, to do something that might be nice for Ellesandra, but she shrugged off the attempt. It was ale, and ale was ale. She didn't need Star going out of her way to try to find a specific kind of ale. Not to mention she rarely drank it anymore. "It doesn't sit in the stomach if you are moving around and being active. It processes into more energy for you." Ellesandra commented, though that wasn't entirely true. It still sat in her stomach like lead sometimes, but for the most part it didn't bother her. The idea of not having duck made Ellesandra shake her head. "If we happen to travel somewhere that I can find them and hunt them, I'll make you some. I'm not the best cook when it comes to something so fancy. There was some duck that was served to me when I was younger and it had this honey glaze they put over it. I had to force myself to be polite and not just devour the whole thing myself." Ellesandra was trying to give Star something to latch onto. To think about her eating duck as a teen, rather than to push on any of the emotional comments from the day before, or to ask about her nightmare. Ellesandra wasn't good at small talk, but she'd take small talk over hard emotional talk.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a mild pout at the notion of there being no need. There might not be a NEED but she'd do it anyway. She didn't just stop being stubbornly kind-hearted overnight. Star did latch onto the idea of Ellesandra having to be polite at the notion of the honey glazed duck, but it was less a cute image of Ellesandra as a teen - though that was cute in itself - and more Ellesandra admitting they liked something a lot. So of course Star was going to find a way to make THAT happen, now. A little people skills could carry someone a long way to getting unique requests fulfilled, and Star had more than a little skill with people. But, she said nothing. She just flashed a genuine and bright smile, and let a little silence come back over them. Something comfortable. She didn't wan to push it on the small talk front. She still wanted to talk about...A lot. But that would wait until they were done eating, at least. And she still had to decide how she would even...Talk about any of it. She still wasn't back to her normal self. She still felt...Wrong.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let the silence stretch as they ate after that. Unfortunately, Star hadn't taken the bait to be distracted by her comment, so she just let the silence build comfortably while eating. She was pretty hungry, but surely not as hungry as Star had been based on her finally feeling better after a bad fever. As she finished, she put the plate to the side with some hash remaining and a piece of toast, which she'd motion Star towards. "If you're still hungry." Turning to take the book, she also held it up. "There was also this, delivered by Serenity. Amara and Amelia were...particularly concerned at the surge of magic yesterday, and Amara helped to expedite the search for magic like yours to help understand what happened. It did help, a little I guess, but something you might be interested in. I think they mentioned that story you told me too, of the 'angel' coming from heaven." She took the book and moved to set it on Star's pillow. An attempt to focus their conversation again on the purpose of their business, Ellesandra being an expert at trying to avoid emotional conversations. If Star let her, of course.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently shook her head at the motion of food. She was full now. She had gone a long while without, so she ate more than usual, but even when healthy she didn't have a huge appetite. She maintained a healthy figure, not one that was overly thin and boney of course, but she was also on the lighter side. She drew in a deep breath, then exhaled slowly. When the book was held up, she tilted her head, then followed it with her gaze when it was set on the pillow. "I'll read it later," she said rather flatly. "The story of Faust's war is fairly common in Gurhal. I'm sure it'll come up a lot. Even if it is ancient history, it's something most everyone knows about; hard not to with the memorials and statues in the major cities." But she didn't want to get too lost in talking about her home. Instead, she focused on Ellesandra. "Ellesandra, we..." She sighed through her nose. "We have to talk about this. I know you hate talking about things like this but...I need to. It's been a long time since I've gotten aura sickness, and as much as I want to just get over it and move on for YOUR sake...That just isn't gonna happen."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The mention of Faust's war got her attention. The same cult of Faust that had allied themselves with Black Diamond? Had she missed that name before when Star explained it? It was possible, she hadn't been paying too much attention to the people in it, more the story. Still, she was pulled from asking about that as Star went to the topic that Ellesandra very much did not want to talk about. Trepidation and concern mixed, eyeing Star and worried about her, but also preferring to walk through flames of hell rather than have a conversation like this. Still, she didn't back down with Star plowing right into the conversation. She just sighed and lowered her head, clasping her hands in front of her and staring at them. "I saw some of it, when trying to help yesterday. I'm sorry for that." Sorry, for doing what Ellesandra considered was invasive. Even if it had been absolutely the right thing to do, and necessary to help Star, she still felt like it had been wrong to do. She considered bringing up the jealousy, to ask why she felt that way or what she was jealous of, but she held back. Instead, she just stayed silent, letting Star lead the conversation wherever she felt it needed to go.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wore a mildly confused expression. "Sorry? I don't understand what you have to be sorry for. My emotions have never been a secret to you. I...Understand your feelings on the matter, and respect them as much as I'm able to. But to me it's only fair that if ever you want to know what I'm feeling, that option is yours to have. So that it's a two way street and it's equal, if you want it to be. I don't have anything to hide, not that that really matters or anything just...I don't want you to apologize for something you're welcome to." She paused, allowing those words to sink in again. "...What do you make of what you saw?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

"I don't feel comfortable with it, even if you're giving me permission. That's why I'm sorry." She shrugged. Star was giving her permission, which honestly should make her feel better about the invasion thing, but it still felt...wrong to just experience someone else's emotions. Ellesandra was an extremely private person, so even with that permission something felt off about it. She'd never interacted with people who so readily shared their emotions like Star did. After a moment considering the question of what she made of them, she took a deep breath and then stood. She moved to the front of the room, just moving to pace some. movement helped her think, at least, and gave her something to do rather than look at Star. "I get that you're attracted to me. And have feelings. And felt rejected by me rejecting my own emotions. All understandable, I guess. I'm emotionally unavailable though, Star. I'm not good for you. You'd do better not to have those feelings, or ignore them like I'm trying to." A pause, and then. "And I don't understand who or what you're jealous of. I understand your loneliness, but I can help make that better without being romantic. You've helped make mine better without romance, right?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star blushed a little and shifted in place as Ellesandra asserted that she was attracted to them. It was true, but hearing it aloud made her heart skip a beat still. She wasn't uncomfortable, but a little nervous about the subject. Her heart was not used to the feelings she was feeling, even if for the moment they were just beginning to blossom in her heart. "I can't tell you what I'm jealous of. It would involve sharing someone else's feelings." She figured that would be enough to put that point to rest, and Ellesandra would just have to know Star was jealous but not about what. "It's not all that simple, though," she said, looking at her own lap. "It hurts me. Constantly, it hurts to see you take emotions and just decide to not feel them, to just shove it all down like they don't matter. It's not like you're the first person I've met who deals with emotions by repressing them, or should I say just...DOESN'T deal with them, by repressing them. But what caused this all to boil over is that you're..." She bit her lip a moment. This was a difficult thing to admit, but she needed to be honest about it, even if it fed into her feelings of inadequacy. "You're the first person to ever actually, genuinely have any spark of feelings for me. Something that isn't just...Lust, I mean. I've seen plenty of lust directed at me." She shook her head. "But I don't want that on its own. I don't want it when it means nothing. I've never even kissed someone romantically, because of this. So...I was so happy when we were cuddling, and you were sharing yourself with me, and it felt like we finally...Finally were able to just bond with one another. I didn't intend on it nor specifically hope for it to spark romantic feelings, but at the same time if genuine feelings like that came to be, well...I never want to deny even the worst emotions from their chance to be felt, I've even less cause to want to deny that sort of feeling." She wasn't calling it love, because it wasn't love, it was just...The feeling that could turn into love, maybe. "And unlike you I know there's no point in trying to deny what I feel. I might actually get sick from doing that, but what you've done to yourself in doing it is no better. It just is more likely to not show the warning signs until it's too late with those who aren't auramancers." She huffed, keeping herself calm as she could and speaking to Ellesandra with concern in her voice, but there was some measure of anger. Not AT Ellesandra, but a general frustration with the notion of repressing emotions in the first place. "I'm not telling you that we have to act on any of those feelings. We don't have to indulge romance. We can just stay friends. I just can't stand constantly seeing you take every positive emotion I see in you and just...Discard it as fast as you possibly can. With a little time and meditation I'll be able to come to peace with these poison feelings I have...This jealousy and anger and pain I feel." She then looked up at Ellesandra, misty-eyed. "But you have to understand that every time you discard your excitement, your happiness, the good things in your heart, it. HURTS. Me," she said, pressing both her hands over her heart. Her lips trembled, putting her on the verge of tears again. "I know you're scared, Ellesandra...Of course I know you're scared...I'm scared, too...But whenever I'm with you, I feel like no matter how scared I am, everything is going to be all right. Even if it's painful, and dark, we'll walk together in the sun again soon."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra continued pacing, not looking over at Ellesandra even as she spoke about how it hurt to see Ellesandra repress her emotions. Guilt bubbled up when she felt it, but she pushed that down - doing literally what Star said was hurting her, and thus causing more guilt, which was a little bit of a vicious cycle honestly. She didn't answer, letting Star continue and explain everything, how Ellesandra was supposedly the first person to have actual romantic feelings towards her. There was definite surprise, and a little indignation at that, the first thought going through her mind being 'what the fuck is wrong with other people?' A few more 'laps' pacing back and forth in the room, teeth clenching at the idea of how much it apparently hurt Star. Part of her wanted to tell Star to suck it up, that it was her way of dealing with things and she could either find another bodyguard or learn to deal with it. Ellesandra didn't, of course. She wasn't going to give an ultimatum like that to Star when it would potentially lead to her leaving without Ellesandra, and then getting herself killed. Ellesandra wasn't going to be the cause of that. But she also didn't know how to...not repress those things. Finally, she answered - "I don't know that I agree that particular feeling is a positive one for me, Star. It terrifies me, and I am not capable or ready of letting myself feel it for anyone. Let alone someone I'm guarding. It's too..." She paused, taking a deep breath, then adding. "Risky."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star, perhaps to the surprise of the knight, gently nodded to the explanation given. "It's not like I can't put two and two together, Ellesandra. The fear that you have, the time you told me you let someone in your care die...I'm confident I've put together at least the very basic idea of what happened to make you feel this way. I have guesses about how you felt about them, but I'd never dare assume I could define such a thing with anything more than broad speculation, and the memory of that person deserves far, far more than that sort of reduction." She gently shook her head. "I'd only ever accept 'knowing' that if you told me yourself. But I also won't press you to do that." She then paused again, looking down at her lap. "...It's a positive emotion, Ellesandra. Even if it's risky. Even if it's dangerous. Even if it hurts. It's always a positive emotion in itself. It's just the...Other factors that have to be accounted for. It can make people do stupid things, it can make people do terrible things...But that feeling itself, is always good. And in a perfect world, it would never cause the pain it does, nor the consequences of that pain. The anger that it inspires in people avenging a slain lover or family member, the...pain of loss that can lead another to take their own life, the fear that comes from how it could hurt you again." She drew in a slow, calming breath. "It can feel like it'd be better having never felt it in the first place, so you could be spared the pain. But that isn't right. It's always better to have loved, in whatever forms that may take, small or large, romantic or not. Even if it hurts...And it almost certainly will hurt us all...It's the most important emotion there is. I believe that with all my heart." She let that linger for a little while, closing her eyes as a few drops fell from her eyes. "So please don't believe it's a bad thing. Even if you can't let yourself indulge it...Just let it live. Even if you're not the person I'm meant to have my first kiss with, or the one who will let me finally feel romantic love blossom in my heart...Just please...Please let that part of you live."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

That mountain stirred. Ellesandra's pacing became more frantic, and with not much space it became more heavy steps than anything. Star didn't have to say what happened for Ellesandra's mind to go to Marigold, and that was even easier considering the recent end to her dream. But the assertion that love was a positive emotion? Anger, mixed with grief and pain. She eventually came to a stop, that pain having only been building as Star continued to talk about the 'good' it could do. About how it could inspire anger, and pain, but it was an overall good emotion. 'even if it hurts' made Ellesandra snort, and she turned to glare at Star. "Nothing." She said in a low, angry voice. "That makes you feel this way is a GOOD thing, Star." Her voice trembled, a combination of the grief and anger that was filling her right now. She was holding herself together, but barely. The mountain was frayed between everything that had happened the past few days, how Star seemed to just tear down every wall and barrier Ellesandra had. How Ellesandra, deep deep down, wanted to be able to feel that emotion with Star, but was absolutely terrified of it creating a second mountain. She knew Star could see the conflict in her, the anger, the grief that just kept getting worse as this conversation had gone on. She stepped up to Star, taking Star's hand and placing it to her chest, right over where that figurative mountain rested. She stared into Star's eyes, in her anger lashing out and trying to MAKE Star feel that grief. The enormity of it, how even now when Ellesandra let herself feel it, didn't distract herself from it or repress it, it was enough to make her want to do very, very rash things to herself to escape it. The guilt that was circled around it, the main thing Ellesandra had felt in Star's presence in regards to this, was but a portion of the mountain that Ellesandra was finally recognizing. Finally acknowledging and feeling. "I. Can't." She whispered, tears having sprouted up, the whisper choked through a tightening throat. "Do that. Again."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could see the height of emotion in Ellesandra. She knew it was dangerous to prod such powerful emotions, but she believed that she and Ellesandra had become close enough that she could do so without Ellesandra thinking she was just prying, or something. She was doing this out of genuine concern. She cared so much about Ellesandra that it was physically paining her to watch the other woman torture themselves like this. She didn't need to be in love with them for it to hurt...But it certainly had come to hurt much more over the time she had known the knight. It only steadily grew worse. When Ellesandra walked up to her and placed her hand upon their heart, she didn't resist. She let the emotion in. And it hurt. It inspired her own grief and her own pains. Those poison emotions that already were within her festered, tearing her apart from the inside as they were fed more of their ilk from Ellesandra. But even as it began to make Star cry, made her wince at the pain of it all, made her need to brace against the waves of torment that threatened to just break her down into tears, she stood firm. These were emotions. These were her domain. There was no easy answers to any of this...But if Ellesandra could stand and fight an enemy that could take a dagger to the brain and keep on fighting without losing their resolve, then Star could stand tall even as a mountain was falling down on her, threatening to crush her. "It's not love that makes you feel this way, Ellesandra," she said, her voice barely a whisper. Hand shaking. Voice trembling. Tears falling. "It's...Loss...It's having lost what once made you so happy. And by all that is good in the world, nothing makes me so...Sad, and angry, and filled with despair as knowing that happiness was lost to you." She then summoned the courage to look Ellesandra in the eyes, her fingers curling into the fabric of Ellesandra's top above their heart, as if wanting to reach in and cradle their heart directly. "But it is not love that makes you hurt. It's the void of what was once there. And I would never make you feel that a second time, Ellesandra. I can't ask you t-to..." She choked through another sob, briefly looking down again before turning her watery eyes back up. "To act on it...But a heart as big and kind as yours deserves to feel that feeling again, if that is what blossoms within it. Even if it is never indulged...It doesn't belong in a cage."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The sight of how it made Star cry, how she began to shake and tremble in response to the emotions immediately sent more guilt through Ellesandra. That had been harsh, to forced Star to feel the same pain that she felt. She'd felt that pain for years, in small amounts. It had been incredibly cruel to force it on Star. Yet even as she considered pulling away, Star curled her fingers into the fabric and held on. "It does." She disagreed, shaking her head. "If it doesn't get felt, it can't do THIS again." Her head dropped and she stared down at the ground between them, her own tears again falling down her cheeks and dripping onto the floor between the two. She tried to put the pain away, to lock it back up, to close that mountain and send it back to it's invisible path in her but...she couldn't. She'd opened it up, and this time she had someone there, offering comfort. Offering to help her through it. And even though in her mind she wanted to close it down, to push it away and prevent it from hurting her anymore, from hurting Star from their connection, she couldn't put it back in it's box. As soon as she realized that too much had come out, that the grief was becoming overwhelming, that she couldn't just push it away, she collapsed into Star. Her head dropped into Star's neck and a wail of grief and pain like no one would have ever expected to hear from the stoic knight came out. The mountain began to crumble and the years of repressed feelings began pouring out. The nights of crying right after Marigold died, and not being able to handle it so she had begun slowly to bundle it up and push it down. The nights of loneliness, the feeling of being utterly alone in the world, abandoned by the only remaining family she'd had afterwards. The supreme guilt for not stopping Mari, for letting her go through with the plan, for not fighting harder against it. For not being there sooner, doing things differently. And more than anything, the grief of losing Marigold - the only person who had been a true friend her entire life. The woman she'd fallen in love with as a teen, and that love had grown only over time. It had never been returned, not in the same way, and there was always some pain in that, but it was nothing compared to the absolute loss of Marigold. She gripped onto Star, hands finding their way to dig into Stars shirt and pull her close even while she moved onto the bed with Star, her legs fully giving out as she literally collapsed, both emotionally and physically.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the weight of Ellesandra's emotions before she felt the weight of their body. But she felt both. And she knew it was going to hurt. But she didn't fight it. She opened her arms just as she opened her heart, accepting Ellesandra onto her as the woman collapsed onto her. She held them as she fell backwards, keeping Ellesandra atop her as everything came crumbling down. Star's heart beat a powerful thud in her chest, and it seemed all at once that the poison in her was banished. It was the rejection of it all that had hurt her so, and the moment of acceptance, of Ellesandra letting themselves feel it all, was enough to have Star gasping as if she had come up from a thousand feet underwater. The resonance of her aura sung out again, and in doing so did it allow hers and Ellesandra's auras to mingle as they once did, which of course meant the outpouring of Ellesandra's grief was felt in equal measure by Star, as it was too overwhelming a force of emotion for even her, the mystic of emotion, to close off. So she held Ellesandra, clutching onto them, holding them for dear life as the mystic empathy carried her into Ellesandra's heart and allowed her to truly connect with the other woman, no matter how painful that was. Tears streamed for her eyes and choked sobs left her...But even through the pain, one trembling hand held onto the small of Ellesandra's back, while the other stroked through the knight's hair. She kept the other woman's head tucked under hers, cradling them close. There were no words for this moment. Nothing that could give any measure of comfort against this onslaught of grief and pain...There was only comfort in one another. The constant, ever-present reminder to Ellesandra that they were not alone. That through this pain, no matter how intense it was, Star was right there with them.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't have much awareness of what was happening, physically. The only thing she knew was she was curling into Stars body, hands grasping her shirt like somehow holding onto her shirt would prevent Ellesandra from drowning in these emotions. It didn't. She didn't notice being pulled onto the bed, she didn't notice the touch on her back and the comforting pets to her hair. Oh part of her took comfort in the touch, but it was so far beyond and behind the feeling of grief and pain that it wasn't an active thought. She sobbed, holding onto Star in the wettest, loudest sobs she'd ever truly had. She'd cried plenty right after the incident, but this had been in her bedroll alone, keeping it quiet and trying to fight it down. She wasn't fighting it anymore though - she felt every bit of it. She didn't even realize that Star was sobbing as well, was feeling and experiencing this grief with her. It would be thirty minutes before her sobbing even began to calm, but even then she still had her head hidden, tears fallen, and large, almost hyperventilating breaths. Unlike Star, she didn't know how to handle this large influx of pain. It was more than pain, but that was so much of it that it's all she could actually feel. It overwhelmed every emotional sense she had, and even as the sobbing stopped it was more because of her physical exhaustion from crying so hard than there not being the pain to sob over.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could handle the pain where Ellesandra could not. It was her greatest strength to be able to face even the darkest emotions, and though they might wound her, she could recover from them. Her purity of self had found itself within her once more, and so came the soothing presence she exuded. It was but a drop in a bucket against a tide of grief as soul-crushing as Ellesandra's, but it would remain there. Time was something of an illusion while they sobbed together, throats becoming hoarse and eyes turning puffy and red. There had been...A lot of crying when they were together. And Star was fine with that. She cried when she had to cry, so that when it came time to laugh or to smile or to love or to feel whatever it is her heart needed to feel, she was able to feel it to its fullest. And though she knew this would not be the end of pain for Ellesandra, truly just the beginning of a long and hard road ahead, it was the first step. The hardest step. And even if it resulted in Ellesandra falling flat on top of Star in how hard it made them stumble, it still was a step that was now behind them. So she cried. She cried as long as she could until her head pounded and her face was a mess. And she kept holding Ellesandra through it, still comforting them, and having only the presence of mind to make a little adjustment so they were both fully on the bed. Otherwise...Little changed in the time they cried. Time, and comfort, were all they had for the moment. There would be much to talk about, much for Star to do to help Ellesandra slowly relinquish this crippling fear. And the desire to face it through every tear and every sob and every wail burned in every fiber of Star's being. Ellesandra's heart had reached out to her. It looked upon Star and allowed a spark of something long buried to live again. Star would guard that with all that she had, though she also knew that part of guarding that fragile heart meant she, herself, had to stay strong, and relinquish many of her own fears and insecurities that could lead to only another tragedy. Star knew in her heart that Ellesandra could survive this. But nobody...Nobody could survive this twice.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She didn't know how much time had passed before she was able to finally draw in breath without crying. Her body had been trembling, shaking, and she hadn't even noticed it. Her eyes hurt, exhausted from crying, red and puffy and upset. Her throat was raw, and still tight. Her body ached from the shaking, her chest felt like there was an elephant sitting on it, and god she hurt, emotionally. Even though she was done crying, it was still painful. It was still so much that she couldn't speak, though she opened her mouth to apologize once she realized she'd been laying on top of Star and sobbing on her, and Star had been sobbing as well. She wanted to apologize, to pull back within herself, to spend time bundling the rest of the emotion that was still hurting back up and pushing it back down. But she couldn't. She couldn't bring herself to do anything. So now she moved to just lay against the bed, rather than on top of Star, and curled up. The depression was hitting, more than the active pain now. The question of why she was even there, why she should bother doing anything when it just hurt this much. But it was progress, really. The mountain was still there, but it was actively there, not being ignored. She closed her eyes, unable to hold back the memories that came with it. She tried to not let them come in, to focus on the present, but she couldn't. And each memory seemed to just make the pain worse, to the point she'd cuddled back up into a fetal position next to Star.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't have the source of the pain in her heart, so it was naturally much easier for her to recuperate from the pain. But even without the source of Ellesandra's grief, she had her own: someone she cared about dearly was in pain. That was enough to keep the weight heavy on her heart, but that sort of pain, that sort of weight was something that inspired action, rather than defeat. So when Ellesandra curled up into the fetal position, Star was right there behind them. She was more than happy to have kept the other woman on top of her - something that in happier circumstances would make her blush up a storm - but she could sympathize with Ellesandra's need to curl up like that. Star wouldn't have wanted an apology, to the point that such a thing might make her mad. Even if she didn't say it, she did hate the idea of Ellesandra apologizing for being in so much pain. She equated it to her bleeding, on death's door, and apologizing to Ellesandra for getting blood on their clothes. All of that was pushed away though, for in the moment, Ellesandra needed her. And she wouldn't be going anywhere. She turned to face their back and slid her arms around them. She pulled their bodies close again, and just as Ellesandra had spent so much time comforting Star the past day or however long it had been at this point since her heart released that vitriolic poison into her, she would care for the other woman now. Her nose buried in Ellesandra's hair. One arm around their abdomen, snaked in between Ellesandra's thighs and middle, and the other around their shoulders, above their arms. "I'm right here, Ellesandra. I'm right here, I always will be. I promise I'll fight with everything that I have to stay right here, by your side. So long as you'll have me, I'm right here."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt Star move to be the big spoon and cuddle against her. Feeling Star's arm around her abdomen, and the other around her shoulders, while she heard Star's comforting words just behind her - it helped. She didn't respond, only curled up onto herself more, but it wasn't a matter of pulling away from Star more than Star's touch, while healing, also reminded her of the loneliness. How she hadn't had this, how she'd not let anyone touch her and how much she needed this type of affectionate comfort. How she'd been all alone after leaving, and no one was there to hold her while she cried. She wasn't sobbing anymore. Oh, there were still tears, but it was as if her body was telling her it was too tired to keep that up. The depression weighed on her and when she considered getting up, trying to go about their day and mission, the motivation to move at all was just...not there. The only motivation she had was to not exist, which wasn't to say she was actively considering acting on that right now - just that in the back of her mind, the desire to not be there anymore was certainly there. Finally, after some time just laying there, having gotten control and grounded about some of her thoughts and beginning to push the memories away, she began to pull move a bit. An adjustment, and then slow pulling away from Star. "I-" Her voice came out raspy, and as she slipped out of Star's arms she would glance back at her, then away quickly. Shame, at what she'd just done. Absolutely breaking down in front of someone - in front of Star - was a shameful thing, in her mind. She'd been raised to be stoic and strong, to stand firm when things went south; and here she was sobbing. Her jaw clenched and unclenched, puffy eyes looking towards the door, then the bathroom. The sadness was still there, the grief. But Ellesandra had finally been able to build up another wall between her and it. It wasn't a mountain, like it was last time; the wall was absolutely transparent. But for a brief break, to maintain her sanity rather than cry for the next few days straight, she'd been able to pull away from the onslaught of feeling, at least a little bit. "Shower." She muttered, feeling gross and icky from all the crying and surely from some of their combined sweat the night before.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It was natural that Ellesandra would need time. This was a process, not a transaction. It was not as simple as comfort in, happiness out. There were tangled knots of feelings, often conflicting, that needed to be loosened and unwound again. Star was certainly concerned with the suicidal acceptance she felt. It was...Understandable. A weight as heavy as the knight's left its scars, its poisonous, infectious mark. It deeply, deeply troubled Star, but she didn't enter crisis mode upon feeling them only because she knew it was...Subdued. Passive. Dangerous, still, yes, but not active ideation. So when Ellesandra began to pull away, she allowed them to do so, but not without a gentle grasp of their hand before they fully separated. She squeezed their hand, looking at them with deep concern in her eyes. She trusted they were just needing to shower, find their center again. But even if she wasn't going to say it aloud, she was going to be focused on them the whole time to make sure the temperature wasn't scalding them. She also passively made certain that the woman wasn't carrying their weapon with them. "There's nothing to be ashamed about, Ellesandra," she said quietly. She wasn't trying to hold them back from showering of course; she released their hand after the squeeze, signaling them to go on and shower and get comfy. There was a tiny part in the back of her mind that envisioned her joining Ellesandra. Not in a lurid way, but the idea of her being there with the knight, bodies bare and pressed together as the hot water cascaded over them both. A tight hold, a tender washing and cleansing. The sensation of their heartbeats beating against one another. A moment where the rest of the world didn't matter. She hadn't said aloud to Ellesandra how she felt about them; as obvious as it might have been - to her at least - that those budding feelings were mutual, she was waiting for a moment to say them explicitly. A time where Ellesandra wasn't wholly rejecting the idea. But even then, there were...Other things that came before she could even begin to entertain the idea of suggesting such intimate things. So for now, she just let them go, mindful to keep her focus on their aura all the while.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra stopped when Star grabbed her hand. She didn't look at Star, knowing Star could see the shame that was unspoken. Her reassuring her there was nothing to be ashamed of did absolutely nothing to reduce the shame she felt, though. When Star finally released her, she moved to the door of the shower and entered. While, if Ellesandra weren't currently so depressed, she might have invited Star in in other circumstances, the thought didn't even cross her mind right now. She removed her clothes in a robotic like fashion and did any of the prep needed. As they'd just been sleeping recently, her rapier was still beside the bed, so she'd been unarmed - not that she would actually act on the suicide ideation right now. That was the thing about duty. She cared for duty more than herself, in reality, and right now her duty was to protect Star and see her back home to her mother, safely. There would be no attempts at killing herself prior to that duty being completed; despite herself wanting to just not exist anymore, to have died instead of Marigold, and a hundred other ways to look at it, she would substain at least until their mission was through. After that is when the thought was more dangerous. And it was part of this duty that Ellesandra kept the water...not scalding. In fact, it wasn't hot at all. It was freezing cold. This wasn't an attempt to hurt herself in any way - cold water didn't hurt, even if it was uncomfortable. What cold water DID do was shock the system. Ellesandra was trying to get her mind out of the state it was in, to focus her back on their task, to stop wallowing in the shame and guilt and grief that had been following her around for the past three years. There was a moment when her hand reached up to her scar on her right shoulder, pressing in lightly. A tinge of pain came from the sore and weak muscle - though that wasn't the purpose of the press. It was a reminder, as that was the scar that she got as she struck the man who killed Marigold down. Revenge didn't mean anything, really, but there was part of her that took pleasure knowing he didn't still exist, after what he did. The thought almost made her burst into tears again, but she held it back this time. Still not mountain like, but more a barrier so she didn't get overwhelmed again. It would be important that she not let it build back up; she could recognize that, and she doubted Star would let her. Her shower wasn't too long, working to wash her face well and try to ease her puffy, swollen eyes. When she came back out, she was wrapped in a towel that started just over her chest, and went down to mid-thigh. It didn't cover 'much', but covered enough, with another wrapped around her head, and moving to her pack to find new clothes. She didn't look in Star's direction, just moving to grab her clothes. The scars on her back and shoulder were partially visible, and as she grabbed her clothes she reached to drop her towel and put clothes on, then stopped. A moment passed, and then she walked back into the bathroom and closed the door to change. She was personally comfortable changing in front of people, but there was concern for - and an attempt to respect - Star's inexperience in regards to the matter.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Though the two of them were women and thus had no real surprises waiting for each other for their nudity, Star didn't want their first time being exposed to each other to be anything less than an intimate experience if it was to happen. The future was uncertain in that regard. It might be different if neither of them were romantically interested in other women, but that potential for intimacy certainly changed things in Star's mind, and made her appreciative of Ellesandra taking their privacy. Star had been cautious about the things she felt from Ellesandra while they showered, nearly giving into the desire to check on them when she sensed the pain. But it was fleeting, so she trusted it was caused by some random muscle contraction or lingering pain, not self-inflicted. Minor, all the same. So she stayed put, lost in her own thoughts. When Ellesandra emerged, she smiled at them, and again when they emerged the second time in their change of clothes. Star then quietly took her turn. She needed a shower, too. And assuming Ellesandra had no objections, she would take it and be out again before long with little of consequence to note during. Of course, while she did this, she was still keeping her focus on Ellesandra's presence. Ready to react to an emergency, even if it meant bursting out in the nude to do so. But if all was well, Star emerged with her long, long white hair left to air-dry after removing most of the water from it with her towel. For once, however, she was no longer in that same dress she had been wearing for the entirety of their adventures together. The dress had been sweat on, stained with blood, and sullied with dirt. Yet none of the stains had ever stayed on, it never held any strong scent of body oils accumulated on it, it always looked freshly pressed and sparkling. Though now, it seemed whatever was keeping it as such no longer applied, for Star to be changed out of it. She also didn't carry a pack, and as had been discussed prior, her arcane pocket wasn't available at the moment, so she carefully laid her dress out on top of the dresser, looking uneasy and uncertain for a moment before stepping away from it and letting it be there, flat with gentle inward folds on the skirt to keep it flat on the top of the dresser. The guest clothing was simple, perhaps a little too big. A white button-up, modest top and white pants. Cotton, comfy, but not nearly as brilliant or beautiful as the dress. For the first time, Star looked just...Plain. Though with her pale complexion, white cotton clothes, and long white hair, there was a bit of blending of her hair with the clothing. When it was wet, her hair descended down to her lower calves, a handful of inches from touching the floor with the tips. All the self care handled, Star looked at Ellesandra, uncertain whether to join them on their bed, or move to her own. The desire was naturally to climb into bed with them, cuddle up some more...But she looked to Ellesandra to see how they felt, not wanting to make them uncomfortable with either her presence or absence.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was perfectly okay with Star going to shower - with how she'd sweat while feverish, she was sure that Star needed one to feel clean again. She sat on the corner of the bed, staring at the door to the shower for a moment. There was a bit of appreciation for Star, mixed with the shame, as well as uncertainty. One thing that resulted from all of this was she felt closer to Star, those feelings - even if they had been caged away so they weren't actively being felt - were still there. And they still grew. Having Star just hold her while she sobbed had been a fan to them, that Ellesandra had accepted that and let herself be held by Star like that again. Along with that recognition was fear, trepidation. If she let herself get too close to Star, and if Star died under her watch, Ellesandra wouldn't be able to get past that. Hell, even if she didn't get close to Star and she died, she wasn't sure she could get past it. So with that in mind, did it matter that she grew feelings? Metaphorically, the bars of that cage became a little wider, letting out a little more light - but the cage was still there. Ellesandra wasn't fully accepting them yet. She busied herself around the room, getting her armor back on and strapping her rapier to her waist, the dagger beneath her skirt and the coin pouch to it. Her hair was put back up in it's high ponytail. She was trying to get into work mode, to push down all the feelings from before, but no matter how good a shower it was it couldn't get rid of the red eyes and slight swelling around them. That would just have to go down on it's own. When Star came out in the guest clothes, it made Ellesandra tilt her head to the side and a very small spark of amusement show. "Those clothes look out of place on you, Star. Are you comfortable in them, or should we find a clothing store nearby?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star blushed a tiny bit and looked away, scratching at her cheek. "It is...Entirely possible I forgot to consider the clothing implications when we came here. Though this place doesn't seem to affect my aura or auramancy abilities, well...The magical space I use to store things is pure, typical arcana...Which...Doesn't work here. Or rather, I can't make it work, like they said would happen. S-So, erm...Yes I'm...Not really comfortable in these clothes for anything besides just lounging in the room here." She shuffled a bit in place, embarrassment clearly on her face. "...I don't suppose we might find someone who could clean my dress, as well as find that clothing shop? This dress is er...It's important to me."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched Star, the embarrassment bringing about a need to protect. She almost wanted to hug the auramancer just to protect from the embarrassment. And it was a good distraction from the depression still in the background of her mind. Something to do, to focus on. With a deep breath she moved to stand up, clapping her hands and wiping them as if wiping the entire situation from earlier this morning off of them. Focus on work, time. "Well, why don't we go check with the bartender if they offer a cleaning service, or if we can find one nearby? Along with a clothes shop. I'd go for you and just do all of that but I'm quite certain you don't want me picking out your clothes or you'll be in more of..." She paused, then motioned to her own dirty clothes. Comfortable, but utilitarian. And the day you caught Ellesandra in a dress of any kind was the day you knew you found yourself an imposter.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile. She could see Ellesandra's protectiveness rise up of course. That in itself had been part of what sparked the romantic attraction in her. One thing among many, certainly, but Star could hardly deny how Ellesandra's strong personality and protective nature inspired...Thoughts. The natural consequence of relying on someone else for protection meant a greater ease and comfort with feeling vulnerable. And allowing herself to feel vulnerable around Ellesandra was one of those feelings that fed on itself, wanting to let herself be more vulnerable, open up more to the knight, let herself fall into their arms more, where it was safe. Indeed, she had a moment while listening and looking at Ellesandra that, now that the heavy emotions were at least for the moment behind them both, the more positive emotions were allowed to flutter up in her chest like a swarm of butterflies. Despite the heavy thud in her chest and spreading warmth that came from it, she kept her cool on the outside as much as she could. She wouldn't be able to hide the blush, but that would possibly just get lumped in with the embarrassment. Still...The way Star looked at Ellesandra in that moment was...Different. A look that was indulging some...Thoughts. Some...fantasies. Now wasn't the time, but Star remained a direct foil to Ellesandra in that she still let herself feel it all, rather than lock it away. She giggled at the insinuation. "I ought to get myself some more typical clothes. I'm sure it'll surprise you to hear that I have a tendency to stand out in a crowd and...I probably should try and break that habit. So we can start there, sure. If not them, I'm sure Amelia knows where we'd need to go or who to talk to." Surely Amelia was the go-to because they had a direct line with the coin, and for no other reasons.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't notice the look Star was giving her. Instead she nodded, eyeing Star's clothes again. "Agreed, something to blend in would be great. And something to blend in when we get to your home plain, too. No need for you to stand out and make it easy for Black Diamond or Faust followers to find you." She shook her head though, at the suggestion of going to Amelia. There was a...defensiveness there. Ellesandra didn't actively dislike Amelia, and there was some respect for her skill with magic, but even if Amelia's attitude was a front, Ellesandra wasn't a fan of that. And for someone who had an attitude that didn't exactly make them approachable to request help, and Ellesandra being someone who didn't feel comfortable feeling indebted to someone, it made Ellesandra's desire to ask Amelia for help below zero outside of potentially major circumstances - like what happened with Star passing out. "Well, we'll start with the bartender first. Surely he'll have an idea of local places. Most of them I've met are local experts." It was kind of a bartender's job to know stuff about the local area these days, anyways. She did a mental check to confirm she had everything - including the sending coin, just in case - before she motioned to the door. "Are you ready?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star noticed the small defensiveness at the mention of Amelia. She mentally sighed. The friction there was what had her doing what she did upon their arrival to this place, trying to smooth over the friction before it could be a thing. She understood that wasn't the right way to do it, but she still had mild frustration about it all. Strong heads often butt against one another, even if both of them were total sweethearts at the core. She let the frustration have its moment in her heart, then it quietly dissipated and went on its merry way. She then nodded to Ellesandra's question. "Something tells me I could hide under the biggest rock I could find and it wouldn't stop those villains from finding us if they wanted to," she said with a mild exasperation behind her words. It was rather obvious their foes were powerful beings, at least at the top. Stealth didn't feel like it was going to be the most effective option, but perhaps she would be surprised. The two did leave the room, with Star holding her dress neatly folded over one arm before her. She kept close to Ellesandra, not quite touching but nearly so, shoulder almost brushing against shoulder. A short trip to the bar had Star taking the lead on conversation as she knew Ellesandra preferred. A quick conversation saw the bartender redirecting them to a guild services area that was a bit deeper into the guild hall. Beyond the gathering and mess hall and through some clearly labeled hallways did they reach the services room, which was enough to get them laundry. Star left her dress with them, and the simple price of five copper pieces for the dress was needed from Ellesandra who guarded the money. Normal clothes ran from one to two copper, but luxury items that required special care clearly had a higher maintenance cost. At least, for those who weren't like Star and had some mystic ability to keep the garment looking freshly sewn every day. Laundry was taken care of there, but the guild hall didn't have actual clothes for sale. They had...Armor, certainly. From splint and scale to halfplate to full plate, to shields and weapons and all manner of adventuring equipment, there was quite a bit they could find if they went looking through the wares in the connected shops, but while a full set of plate mail would technically cover Star, it was...A little absurd to imagine the mystic woman in any sort of armor. Comical, even. There certainly were things on offer that would outshine Ellesandra's own equipment - masterworks of armor that would make the knight all the more tenacious in battle, or a new rapier forged of stronger, enchanted metal. The skill in the creation of this equipment was peerless. But with that came an associated price tag - hundreds to thousands of gold pieces at the low end, tens of thousands at the higher end, and surely even more that wasn't for sale en masse. Far outside their budget, though if Ellesandra needed other cheap and common equipment like rope, pitons, a whetstone for their blade, or anything of the sort, it was all available and for better than usual prices. Perks of guild membership, perhaps, though whether they would be permitted to return to this guild hall after they left was anyone's guess. They weren't members, after all, though it seemed that as guests they still had access to its discounted services for now. That all said, actual civilian clothing - that is, not the enchanted robes that were intended for magi that certainly would be fitting for Star - was not really the focus of what the guild offered. Enchanted clothing meant for battle would certainly be more protective for Star, but it was similarly in the realm of hundreds of gold pieces that would, even if they could afford it, would drain nearly all they had to work with for funds, whereas civilian clothes might cost in the range of...Ten or so gold at the higher end, one or two at the lower. But for that, they would have to leave the athenaeum and return to the markets that surrounded it in Myst. But it was Amelia who let them in here - would they be able to return without a member of the guild to let them in? Difficult to say for certain, so Star once more looked to Ellesandra for guidance on what they thought was the best way forward.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was appreciative of Star stepping forward to do the talking again. It meant that Star was feeling better, for one, to take on her role as the 'face' of their little group. It also meant that Ellesandra didn't have to do all the interacting, and she instead took the time to look around the guild hall, taking it in fully again. The times she had been down before to get food and stuff for Star and her while Star recovered, she'd been focused on her task. As they went to pay to get the dress cleaned and stopped by the guild store, Ellesandra did give an appreciative glance at the craftsmanship of the equipment around her. It was obvious whoever did this was particularly skilled, and they had some form of enchanter on staff most likely as well. Though Ellesandra had that stoic look on her face while looking at the weapons and armor, Star would be able to see the appreciation there. In a way, Ellesandra enjoyed window shopping when it came to things like this. No intention of buying anything, but being able to peruse and see quality items was nice. Being faced with the fact that there were no clothes there for Star though, Ellesandra sighed. "Just a moment." Pulling out the sending coin, she'd consider what to say for a second before sending a message to Amelia. Ellesandra spoke out loud, even though she knew she didn't need to, so that Star could at least be part of her side of the conversation. "Apologies for bothering. Star is recovered, looking for a place to get mundane clothes and supplies. If we leave, can we return?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The mental message received was clear and concise, only for Ellesandra to hear: 'Not into this hall without someone from the guild to let you in. You are guests. Want me, or Amara?'


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded, considering. She glanced over to Star, remembering how Star had specified reaching out to Amelia - not Amara. She hadn't noticed it before, but being given the option now made her realize the specificity of Star's request. After a moment of consideration, she responded. "Whoever's available, I have no desire to take either of you away from something important. If it's equal, you, and we can wait." Despite her own preference being for Amara, Star hadn't asked to have Amara take them; she'd asked to have Amelia take them. So Ellesandra would relent towards that.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

'Better to not bother the captain, yes. Wait for me in the foyer' was the reply. Star didn't have any real reaction to the conversation, but did smile at Ellesandra for making the conscious effort to include her as best they could. She knew how the Sending spell worked, so could recognize it as a conscious choice on the knight's part. Just another tiny appreciation for their thoughtful efforts.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took in a deep breath to prepare for interacting with Amelia, but nodded to Star. "Amelia is on her way. She said to meet her in the foyer." It made sense that Amelia wouldn't want to bother the captain, too. Ellesandra should have considered that anyways. Amara was probably busy - not that Amelia wasn't busy too but, either way. She would put the coin back and then begin heading towards the foyer, ensuring that Star was following and didn't stay behind for whatever reason.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star kept pace, keeping close to Ellesandra as she had before. Off to the foyer they went, and did indeed have to wait about ten minutes for Amelia to show up. Once they did, greetings were exchanged and the group was able to head off. Back through the portal which appeared to be the only way into this hall, at least from this entrance. Though this time, they appeared near the entrance of the athenaeum, rather than the previously used portal from the library services area. Naturally, they were portals, and this place had been built with freedom for the portals to go to specific places, depending on who it was opening the portal. It made getting around much faster, certainly, as walking from point to point in this place might take hours. Convenient, yes, but more so seemed...Necessary. It would be too much to traverse otherwise. Either way, Amelia seemed to be in a different mood. From her body language to her tone, a lot of her attitude seemed to vanish while around Star. There was some guardedness around Ellesandra still, but it looked more like nervousness. Something was different, as the group headed out to the markets under Amelia's guidance. Some brief talk was had about what sort of clothes Star was looking for, to which she clarified it needn't be anything fancy, but still hopeful for something...Pretty, an admission made with a little flush on her cheeks. They then got into a back and forth talking about specifics to help narrow things down. Naturally, Ellesandra wasn't being ignored, but if the knight was going to remain quiet, then it seemed these two had enough friendly chemistry between them forming to keep the conversation going and leave the knight to their silence.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't notice Amelia's change in mood majorly, or rather that it was specifically around Star that it seemed to vanish. She did seem less prickly, but Ellesandra didn't comment on that. Nor did she really speak much at all, other than greeting Amelia and thanking her for leading them out. Part of her felt bad that they needed to have a guide to come and go, and didn't like the idea of being dependent on Amelia or Amara in that way. Then again, Star seemed to be enjoying herself during the conversation about clothes. Ellesandra didn't interrupt, following through the portal and looking around to keep an eye on their surroundings. While Star had been following close to Ellesandra before, now Ellesandra was doing the same to Star. She followed closer than she had been before, concern with her safety being higher considering how recently she'd been sick. Unless spoken to, she didn't add anything to the conversation though, content to listen and keep an eye out on things, and follow around while they went about finding a good clothes shop for Star. She might pick out a new pair of leggings or two while they were out, considering she'd been struck in the legs a few times in recent fights and they had been torn, but that was all she'd look for for herself, and it would only be if it happened to be convenient where they went - she wouldn't go out of her way for it or bring it up to ask about.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The quiet from the knight didn't mean Star was ignoring them, certainly. She didn't pressure Ellesandra to get involved in the conversation, but she still made sure to give them a smile in the quiet moments, along with the occasionally touch on their arm. A simple reminder that she was thinking of them. She specifically watched for any discomfort, though assuming she didn't see any she was sure to just keep up the occasional reminder that she wasn't ignoring them. Not that she assumed Ellesandra thought that, but even if the knight was just a friend she'd want to ensure they didn't feel out of place. And as it stood, Ellesandra was now in this weird place where they weren't just a friend, but they also weren't anything more than a friend, in her heart. And not that Ellesandra ever focused on Star's emotions enough to notice, but if today proved to be opposite day for them, there was a matched feeling in Star's heart to what Ellesandra felt and then caged up. Star of course never caged her feelings like that, but it was also too subtle to push through that barrier between emotions the two maintained when things were calm. So unless Ellesandra flipped their own script, it was a normal, mundane couple hours of shopping. A few different shops were visited on different discs of settlement, with the occasional sight of one of the towering automatons just doing their patrols. It was peaceful and boring, but that was exactly what made for a safe place. Safe enough that shop owners could abandon their shops for lunch and leave things unattended - a thief wasn't above the watchful gaze of the scrying eyes of Myst, after all. It seemed the people of Myst knew quite well how bad of an idea it was to try and get away with even petty crime just because nobody was actively looking at them. A more thorough trek through the city revealed more variation in the species of people. Some had tails, some had horns, some scales, some had bright midnight-toned skin, others a pallid white, and even a few greenskinned half-orcs here and there. It was a melting pot of cultures and people from human to dragonborn to halfling to tiefling to tabaxi to all other sorts. There was even an aarakocra flying briefly overhead at one point, and the purveyor of the shop that ultimately had a nice set of blue clothes that caught Star's eye was an air genasi woman who moved about the shop by briefly turning to a gust of air that shot over to where she wanted to be and then reformed in her mostly human-like figure, though the curvy leylines of cerulean mana on her face made her elemental heritage clear even without the whole turning-into-air thing. The shop owner was proud of her work, as was typical of genasi folk, though it wasn't without merit. Even the less flamboyant outfits were made with care and precision that did well to accent the feminine form. The shop owner talked up their dresses, which were flashy and opulent with gems and filigree, though the prices for those were quite a bit more than what Star and Ellesandra were looking to spend. And were also contrary to the goal of being LESS standout. Star naturally handled the situation well, mixing in praise for the garment while redirecting seamlessly to her actual desired purchase. The leggings that Ellesandra had been keeping an eye out for were also proudly on display here, though the leggings for sale here were very much less utilitarian and more feminine, with accent on the lace at the rim of the leggings and made of a shapely fabric that hugged and ever so gently pinched the thighs. And alongside those leggings were, well...Night wear of the intimate persuasion, from sheer negligee tops to flirty and evocative panties. The leggings were tight, so they would serve the purpose, and they came in either black or white, but it then came to Ellesandra to decide if they wanted - or could tolerate - something more flashy, or if it was better to find a way to repair the ones they already had.

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra offered Star a smile here and there when she reached back to touch her and remind her of her being accepted into the conversation, should she have wanted it. She still remained quiet, certainly not digging into Star's emotions at all, and using the time to both keep an eye out and familiarize herself with some of moving about Myst. It would take a while before she felt comfortable travelling here but after practice she was sure she'd be able to; the only issue being that she'd still have to rely on Amelia or Amara in order to get back into the guild hall. Perhaps they could find somewhere else to stay? If needed they could, but she doubted Star would want to potentially insult the two by making the request. Being on guard duty helped her push her feelings from this morning down. To properly build that wall again, not just translucent. Oh, it wasn't the mountain it was before; the grief and loneliness and guilt were all still there, but they were acknowledged then ignored. Before, Ellesandra was simply pretending they didn't exist, forcing them down so far she could go about life without them interacting with her at all. Now, they were always there, in the background. She'd see a dress while following along for the shopping that would send a jolt of pain through her, reminding her of Marigold, or she'd glance someone travelling by with red hair and her attention would snag on it for a moment before disappointment bubbling up. Small things, natural things when healing from a loss. Things she hadn't let herself do before. Naturally, she knew Star would see these. If Star ever looked about to ask or comment on anything that bubbled up, Ellesandra would shake her head silently and offer her a brief smile to reassure her that everything was alright. Well, 'alright'. When she did find the leggings that she'd been looking for, she very quickly passed them up. Sure, they would work, but she was not about to wear something that would draw more attention to herself either. They weren't her style, nor did she desire to have to deal with the comments from Star or Amelia, or even Amara, at seeing her in them. The lingerie was completely ignored; if she had a place to call home, a place to settle down and someone to do that with, she would have given those pieces more attention. However, she wasn't about to carry lingerie around in her pack when the only romps she had were with random women and nonbinary people around a tavern when between jobs. And she was still in denial in regards to her and Star, even if things kept growing between them.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star did a bit more talking with the genasi owner of the shop before settling on some plain clothes. But a little more discussion went on, and whether it was something about Star herself, or the way she had been speaking to the genasi and playing into their natural pride of their work with her praise and general sweetness, it came to be that the owner of the shop began to insist on Star taking a flashier garment with them as well. Not for free of course, but a good deal was offered for the common clothes and what was not a full on gown like Star's other dress, but was still pretty, still dressy, with a flared skirt and an exposed back. A garment that was, according to the shop keeper, enchanted with air magic that allowed the wearer to be fleet of foot and be carried by the winds. Something that certainly was worth a few hundred gold pieces for its magic alone, but offered to be bought along with the common clothes for just fifty gold. Amelia, who had been vaguely involved in the conversation, looked a little jealous about the offer, but kept a lid on her frumpy body language. Star wasn't expecting to part with that much, so she looked at Ellesandra with a bit of a blush on her cheeks. The tactical use was obvious: either to get to Ellesandra in a moment of need, or perhaps more importantly to the knight, the ability for Star to get away from danger with that burst of speed the garment promised. The difficult matter was that their money was not infinite, and though they were spared lodging costs, the food costs were taking little by little from their savings. Any purchases they made would have to potentially require the two of them do work somewhere to make up the cost and keep them afloat as they progressed towards their goal. Star wasn't going to make the decision alone however, so, she asked plainly: "What do you think, Ellesandra?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched the air genasi and Star converse, seeing the interest in Star even as they began talking about the magical skirt. Once Star looked at her, before even speaking up, Ellesandra was reaching for the coin pouch and pulling it out. She set it in Star's hand to count out the coin and pay; Ellesandra considered it Star's money in all honesty, and they'd been given a good amount of it by Morrun. Plenty enough to get a splurge item and be mindful of food spending and such. Her answer was unspoken, but she did add verbally - "A good deal on an item that will help to keep you safe, Star. I see no harm in that." Plus, there was a small bit inside of her that wanted to see Star happy and get something for herself she enjoyed. Ellesandra would never admit to that, but there had been no mistaking a certain...enjoyment of watching Star shop, being able to just forget about her stresses for a little, chat with Amelia and find something nice to wear other than the one dress she had. Ellesandra was careful with money and planning, but they'd been given enough that their padding would be alright as long as they didn't splurge on anything else, and were mindful not to get the most expensive foods and drinks.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

In total the expenditures between food and lodging thus far, plus the fifty gold they had just spent, left just over four-hundred gold pieces left in their coffers. That, plus whatever Ellesandra and Star had prior to their payday. Still more than enough to keep them going for a long time if they were mindful of costs. Star did light up in the eyes when the go-ahead was given. Not that either one of them made the decision alone, at least in Star's mind, but it also was that she wouldn't do so without confirming with her companion. And if the two ever got playfully up in arms about whose gold it was, Star was sure to remind Ellesandra how it was technically the knight's gold, just 'donated' to the mutual adventure fund, which was, as far as Star was concerned, a bunch of nonsense. The semantics didn't truly matter to her though, only that she and Ellesandra were on the same page. So with that all done, what followed was an insistence from the proprietor of the shop that Star try it on, mostly so the shop keep could see their creation on the new owner. Once more, a satisfaction of genasi artisanal pride. Something Star couldn't really refuse, so she was ushered into a change room after leaving her new common clothes with Ellesandra to hold. The fitting room was just a small side room in the shop, Ellesandra would be able to see it was just one way in and out, which was the door they were all near, and had just a bench and a mirror and a hook to hang the clothes. Star was obviously going in alone, but any strange noises would be able to have Ellesandra rip the door open and spring into action easily enough. Still, Star imagined there'd be a little paranoia from her dutiful protector, so she was certain to give them a reassuring look before going in. A short minute or two passed before she emerged again, having put her hair up into a long ponytail while in the change room as the garment came with a decorative hair ornament that would be wasted otherwise. When she stepped back out, she did a little twirl, then immediately blushed for having done so, and looked most specifically at Ellesandra for their reaction to her new outfit. Not really the step down in flash they had been looking for, but it was at least...slightly less so than her poofy, feathery dress. "S-So uhm...How do I look?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

They could probably argue and butt heads over the coin every day during meals and never come to being on entirely the same page of it. Ellesandra didn't mind though, as Star paid and began moving to try it on. Ellesandra would take the coin purse back after the payment was complete to place back where it was, then eyed the changing room. Star was absolutely right that Ellesandra was paranoid, and she almost insisted on going inside with Star, but held back that bit. Instead she watched it and considered where it would let out to on the outside if it did, as well as how long she would give Star. She listened intently while Star was inside, the more common clothes thrown over one arm and glancing over at Amelia briefly, though she didn't speak up to her. When Star came back out and asked how she looked - well. Ellesandra's face remained mostly stoic, only her eyebrows raising as she looked Star over. To the outside, she looked amused at Star's nervousness at asking. Star would be able to see attraction though, firmly behind the motivation of Ellesandra's gaze up and down her. She took a moment to answer, working to not make that so obvious in her voice and wet her lips before she answered - "Like you'll stand out in a crowd from a mile away. But it fits you, and as you said our enemies are likely to find us anyways." A reassuring smile was given before she nodded. She knew Star would have been able to see the attraction, and knew that part of it need not be said. Was she beginning to rely on Star seeing her emotions to not say the hard things, or the awkward things? That thought surprised her, but she pushed it away for now. No need to worry about that right now, anyways.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star naturally saw the attraction. If she wasn't who she was, didn't have the power she had, she might have found Ellesandra's response to be a little disappointing. On the surface, it was. She was nervous, wanting reassurance about how she looked, and 'you stand out' and 'it fits' were not really the words she wanted to hear. But that wasn't the story. Ellesandra knew what Star could see, and Ellesandra didn't seem to be actively trying to hide that feeling. It said to her that they wanted her to see it. And she saw it. And it deepend her blush significantly. Her hands folded behind her and she had a...Moment. A moment of looking at Ellesandra. Their attraction was felt, and it made her want to...Be prettier in their eyes. Strike a cute pose. Indulge their attraction and fan that flame. Her heart wanted Ellesandra to...want her. Her chest fluttered and one leg twisted just slightly to push her knee into the other knee, then gently tapped the tip of her toe against the floor a few times. A nervous little gesture that told the tale of where her mind was going. But not only were they in public, they also were in an uncertain place together. She couldn't help how she felt, she wouldn't want to repress her emotions regardless. But she at least was kept from that feeling becoming anything more than just a feeling by the other factors. Her heart was just going to...Be a little quicker for a bit. The genasi owner was beside themselves, swelling with pride at the beauty of it all. Amelia looked...Genuinely happy for Star, and made heart-hands at Star to show her thoughts on the matter. Ellesandra would get their wish. A little moment for Star to just...Be happy. Forget her troubles. Have a little spotlight for a moment and truly uplift her. With business concluded, the group was clear to head out again, though Star was still a little dazed, and Amelia was more or less just following the other two around until it was time to head back.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched as Star looked nervous, shy, and...happy. The little motions, the leg twisting, the knees - it was enough that Ellesandra couldn't actually stop the small smile that tugged at the corner of her lips. Through the stoicness, the smile broke out, though Star could see the...well, it wasn't so much 'joy' as happiness and excitement at seeing Star happy like that. Part of her wanted to step up and hug Star, to spin her around and make the skirt go spinny like they were dancing or something. She did not, though. While Star let her feelings for Ellesandra be felt, Ellesandra did not. They existed, right on the edge of her periphery, caged and growing within it, but not felt. Attraction was entirely separate from those romantic feelings, and one that Ellesandra let herself feel. Attraction was something she experienced for many people occasionally, and it had nothing to do with emotions. And Ellesandra was not going to admit how those emotions she had for Star only fueled and flamed the attraction; how the same outfit on Amelia wouldn't have drawn nearly the same reaction. So, she just smiled softly while Star received the attention and applause for looking great in the skirt, and followed out as they finished their shopping. She stopped, turning to look between Amelia and Star. She was torn between wanting to see Star out and about and happy, not wanting to inconvenience Amelia any more, and also wanting to go on with their mission to get information on Star's home plane and how to access it. They'd already wasted essentially two days with the combination of Star's sickness and Ellesandra's emotional mess of a self. "Where to, or back to the guild? I'd at least like to stop by the library and ask Serenity for any updates, if that would be okay Amelia." She could leave it open, let Star choose if there was somewhere else she wanted to go before then.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star couldn't deny her own desire to get back to the mission. As much as she enjoyed this moment of being allowed to feel pretty and cute, how she found a tasteful appreciation in the asymmetry of one leg having a legging and the other not, and generally just feeling happy for having a new, pretty outfit that was enough to get even Ellesandra to look at her amorously, she couldn't let all of that distract from the reality that her mother was still trapped, still possibly suffering. She had the guest clothes folded over one arm, having briefly stepped back to retrieve them before exiting. She wouldn't stop Ellesandra from taking them if they pushed to do so, but also wouldn't foist it upon them. Something to return to the guild hall. But aside from having to wait until her dress was done being laundered, the only thing stopping them from going ahead was the actual process of finding how to get back to Gurhal. Given this was the city of gates, or so was its reputation, Star didn't imagine it would be too hard. And there was no reason she needed to just pause everything to focus on Ellesandra's needs, too. Whether they were in the safety of Myst or out in the wilds together, she could still...Talk to Ellesandra. And there was much to talk about, though it would probably be easier to get them to feel comfortable enough to cry when in a safe room like they had been, not having to worry about making excess noise and attracting attention. All that in mind, Star nodded. "I'd like to pick up the materials and get to studying them, then head back to our room." Amelia nodded. "No trouble, I'm still on rest. I'm fine again, plenty recovered from expending my mana, but captain is paranoid like that. There's no pressing mission for the First Crusaders right now, so that's code for captain to tell us all to sit around and rest while we can," said Amelia with a casual shrug. "So right now I'd just be reading. Getting a little time in the sun and stretching my legs isn't so bad, and you got a total steal out of it. Just make sure to test its effect once you actually leave Myst, yeah? Not that it happens often, but some merchants have tried to swindle people by claiming something is magic, but you can't test it here because of the dampening field - which is true - only for them to leave and find it's just mundane. That genasi has been here for a while so I trust they're being honest, and they're magical enough to do what they say, but still worth it even if just to know how it works," explained Amelia, showing some good pragmatism that was mostly free of her typical attitude. Maybe the rest had been good for her? She had certainly been more mellow. Aside from maybe finding Amara a little overly cautious, the bratty girl Ellesandra knew was nowhere to be found. "If you want another set of eyes, o-or something, I might as well do something useful and help you, i-if, like, you want that, or...something. Might be a lot of books to sort through.." And now Amelia was...blushing? Arms folded, looking away from her companions at some interesting patch of wall on the building to her side. Star smiled a big, knowing smile. Obviously she could see right through Amelia's nervous little show and could see how much they wanted to keep the company - it didn't take an auramancer's eyes to see as much - but Star still looked at Ellesandra. They were the one who had friction with the other woman, so Star let them answer. Help was nice, but she didn't want Ellesandra to feel annoyed at all for it.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to what Star said, then looked over at Amelia as she suggested caution. Ellesandra would have considered that normally, but she had begun to feel accustomed to Star's power. She hadn't even questioned if the woman had been lying; Star had trusted her, and therefore she likely wasn't lying. When she brought up potentially helping, or offering to help anyways, and then....blushing? She paused, watching Amelia, then looking over at Star. Suspicion and a very, very small spark of jealousy. It was small because she never pretended to lay claim on Star in any way, and Ellesandra didn't even recognize it as jealousy, but there was just something that felt off about the idea of if Amelia liked Star. Of course, Ellesandra wasn't certain that was the cause, either. It could very well be that Amelia was just trying to learn more about Star and her magic; she had been quite interested in it when Ellesandra had explained some of it. And perhaps the blushing was just admitting her ignorance? She seemed to enjoy knowing things other's didn't, and priding herself on that. When Star looked at her to confirm, she nodded. "I see no issue as long as Star is comfortable with it. I certainly won't be much help; words on paper tend to scramble together in my brain a lot. One of the reasons I never really spent much time in studies as a child." She'd quickly found her niche with Sia, and her foster 'parents' had forced her to do just enough learning that she wouldn't embarrass them, but that was it.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star tilted her head gently at Ellesandra's admission of dyslexia. "Oh? Hm," Star said, taking that and keeping it neatly tucked in memory. She would be sure to do any sort of study that was needed. Amelia gave a more direct look at Ellesandra, recognizing the symptom but...Not feeling it was her place to say 'hey, you probably are dyslexic', not least of all because...What would it change? Putting a label on it didn't change Ellesandra's experience of it. Star was more committed to ensuring that she support Ellesandra in it, naturally. "Of course I have no issue with you joining. You're welcome among us, Amelia," said Star, smiling. With that decided, their path forward was clear. If this was a case of Amelia having attraction to Star, Star certainly wasn't reacting to it the same way she did when Ellesandra's interest sparked. Star did say nobody before Ellesandra had shown actual, genuine romantic interest in her, which was the truth, which also meant if it was just a physical attraction that was seen, it likely meant nothing to Star. Or maybe Star was just doing well to hide what she saw? Maybe she was trying to make herself less 'readable' in that regard so Ellesandra wouldn't inadvertently breach consent of another sharing information through such intuition? It was a complicated situation, one leaving more questions than answered about the emotions in play. But, it seemed the night ahead of them would be one spent in study while Ellesandra did...Whatever Ellesandra would do while they studied. "Oh, though if you don't really feel like studying with us, I'm sure captain still wants to talk to you about...Whatever it was they wanted to talk about." Annnd there came the jealous glance away from Star, clearly trying not to let it show...


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra wasn't ashamed of her inability to read well, even if she didn't know the cause. She could read, and that was more than some people. She also never claimed to be well studied. It didn't mean she wasn't intelligent, either. She was good in class, about averagely anyways, when it was simply spoken lesson. It was only when she had to write or read that she struggled in them. She would begin to follow along, shaking her head at Amelia's offer. She, still, didn't seem to notice the jealousy from Star regarding Amara, and didn't put her odd look together with the jealousy she'd felt during the aura cleansing that had been done. "I don't think so, not unless the captain decides she wants to take a trip down to the archives with us. I don't mind standing around while you two study; it was part of my training how to entertain myself while keeping guard, so don't mind me. At the very least, the architecture and design of the building is interesting and will keep me distracted for a bit, but I'm not unused to extremely boring guard duties." Unspoken was that she wasn't going to leave Star alone there, even if she was alone with Amelia. Amara was welcome to join them and they could sit away so they didn't disturb Star or Amelia, but Ellesandra wasn't about to go off and have a chat with Amara while Star was in a different place studying.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia rose a brow at the answer, but ultimately just shrugged. Star tilted her head. "Oh. I thought we were going to bring the materials to our room?" She asked aloud, thoughtfully tapping the corner of her mouth with an extended index finger. "As long as you remain on athenaeum grounds the books can be brought anywhere. The guild services desk accepts book returns," explained Amelia as she began walking back to the athenaeum. They could figure out the logistics while heading back. "I wouldn't want you to be bored, Ellesandra. Not without just cause anyway," said Star. It being normal for the knight didn't mean she enjoyed it, and she still had a lot more trust in Myst in general than Ellesandra did. She understood that it was a source of comfort for them to remain near her of course, and she certainly wasn't going to deny them that, nor the chance to be close to them regardless. The thought of laying on Ellesandra, cuddling up while she studied the material crossed her mind. It made her heart flutter again. Not a thing she could do with Amelia in the room as well, however. "Could always pick a spot to study in the training grounds if you wanted to watch some sparring or magic duels. Always good entertainment that can teach a thing or two by observation. Can be a tad noisy though," suggested Amelia. Decisions, decisions..


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Oh. Ellesandra had assumed they would find some secluded table in this library and just do their work there. Realizing they would be bringing the books back to the room, she considered. She could theoretically spend time in the main guild area, but there was always a risk someone would come to the room without her there. It wasn't like she was going to post up at the door or anything, but she still didn't know that she felt comfortable leaving Star alone like that. The comment about studying in the training grounds did elicit interest in Ellesandra, just like it had when Amara had mentioned potentially finding someone to spar with there when they'd first entered. A small modicum of excitement and interest, but after a moment of consideration Ellesandra shook her head to the idea. "That would be too distracting, I'm sure." Not just distracting noise wise, but distracting for Star having to see all of the different aura's while trying to focus on the books. She wasn't sure what it was like in public places, but since it wasn't something she could just turn off, Ellesandra was almost sure that it would be distracting if there were people around like that. "Don't worry, though. I've brought some wood in my pack, and can spend the time whittling away. I'll be fine." This was added mostly for Star's benefit, as she was the one who indicated that she didn't want Ellesandra to be bored unnecessarily. "And if it gets too bad, I can help with the books." It would just take longer, and make her head hurt. But she could help.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was only so much Star could bear to watch Ellesandra get excited and then just...Throw it all away. That tolerance grew samller by the day, in part because it itself wore upon her heart to see such consistently abandoned excitement or positive feelings, and in part because her budding romantic feelings for Ellesandra made every negative thing that much more unbearable to watch. So came a resurgence of a more...Stubborn look on Star's face. "It would hardly be distracting. And depending on what sort of things there are to see, I might learn something useful in watching such displays," said Star with a crossing of her arms. She spoke true, but it was absolutely correct to assume a large part of her decision was based on seeing Ellesandra excited. And after Ellesandra had lifted her up so much just minutes ago, there was a definite air that Star was ready to fight about this seemingly mundane topic. It was about so much more than just where to study. "I'm sure Amelia and I can more than handle this study project, not that you aren't welcome to help too if you want. But best pick a place that enriches us all, no?" asked Star. Amelia smirked. "I think I'll uh, just let you two figure out the 'where', then." Amelia didn't say it, but she could see a lover's quarrel for what she believed it to be.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra frowned at Star, unsure why she was suddenly suggesting that. She seemed ready to fight on this topic. It took her a moment to realize that Star probably saw the interest Ellesandra had felt in that and she took a deep breath, closing her eyes. Was that going to happen everytime she was interested in something, but put it to the side for the betterment of their mission? She thought back to when she'd felt it before and remembered Star blowing her cheeks out - frustration? There was real consideration whether she should argue against this, but eventually she shrugged. "Training pitch it is, then. To be clear though, I'm not going to be partaking. Can't really guard you when I'm distracted by an opponent or training exercises." And a training pitch was arguably more dangerous than a library, considering it was possible some form of attack got off track and could go in their direction without it even being hostile intent. That seemed like a good compromise for Star, yeah?


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Compromise wasn't so much how it seemed to be received. Star smiled. Her arms stayed crossed but there was an immediate lightening to her posture. No longer rigid, she visibly relaxed. Seemed like she got everything she wanted. In truth, she still wanted Ellesandra next to her, so them going and practicing wasn't her desire. That was more something she would happily watch them do, but more felt that was their choice. "Glad we're in agreement. I won't complain if you change your mind and want to partake, but I'm happy keeping you sitting with me." Not quite as bold of an admission as she wanted to make but...There were better times to flat out say she was halfway to thinking about all this as a date. It wasn't, not least of all because of the furry-eared third wheel, but that didn't stop her hopelessly romantic heart from enjoying the idea anyway. With that settled, they would still have to go to the library service desk first to speak to Serenity. A trip that would be uneventful unless Ellesandra had more on the subject.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had expected Star to push for her to stay busy, or do something on the training grounds. Her mind went back to Star suggesting training as a way of processing emotions, but the comment of her being happy to keep Ellesandra sitting with her made her tilt her head in confusion. That...kind of came off as flirtatious, even if it wasn't actively flirting. She glanced over to Amelia, as if trying to get confirmation of how she'd interpreted that, before back to Star. "I...okay." She was unsure how to proceed with this. She was still firmly in the 'nothing can happen between us' camp, even if those feelings were growing. They were still locked away for a reason; just because Ellesandra had cried her heart out onto Star earlier that day did not mean she was ready to let Star into her heart. There was still healing that needed to be done, and Ellesandra still needed to admit to herself how much those feelings were growing. Either way, she would nod and agree to this, and was mostly quiet and thoughtful while they were speaking to Serenity to get the books. The only thing Ellesandra added as to thank Serenity for her bringing the book the previous night, as it had, in fact, given her a lead on how to help. Beyond that, she was in typical guard, following quietly duty.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly wasn't flirting. She wasn't pushing what she knew would take time. She WANTED to flirt. She want to do a lot more. She had building, exciting feelings in her heart that filled her head with fantasies of her and Ellesandra, things that made her heart race and her breath feel like it was being sucked from her chest. She did not reject these feelings. She let herself feel it all, let herself desire Ellesandra. But she did not let those emotions blind her to the very real and present need for Ellesandra to heal, before anything else. Her feelings might lead nowhere. Her feelings might lead to later disappointment and loneliness. But no amount of pain that might come from later rejection would make her deny what she felt. And ultimately, her desire in the moment, the stubbornness on insisting they study where they were to study, was largely unrelated to her romantic interest. No, that was just a giant pouty face that crossed its arms in her heart and said to Ellesandra: 'be happy, damnit'. Amelia met Ellesandra's glance, but Amelia's face revealed nothing. A little stone faced on the matter. Not even an acknowledging shrug. The group detoured to the guest lodging in the guild hall first to deposit Star's extra clothes so they needn't be carried everywhere. The group arrived at Serenity's office swiftly after their detour, finding there was a pile of a dozen books that had been set aside for them. The thanks were met with a warm and tender smile from the librarian, and general happiness that she had been of help and service. Truly, that was what gave her vocation purpose and meaning. Enrichment of others and helping all those who came to Myst have a better life, through the power of the written word. The books were naturally split around the group, four for each to carry. Most of them seemed to be journals, first-hand accounts, transcribed again onto identically bound books that could only be told apart by their strictly logical titles, though one was titled 'The War of the Dark Curtain', which if studied proved to be a retelling of many details of that same war Ellesandra had heard about being significant to Gurhal. Amelia looked quite surprised that there was so little material on the subject, though remarked that it was surely natural that some planes eluded the mission of the Followers of Myst to gather information. There were only so many guild members, after all. Perhaps in another thousand years, the archives would come to encompass every civilized plane. Regardless of future prospects, the current moment saw the group arriving at the training grounds. And while Ellesandra might be expecting a muddy pit with straw dummies, what they instead came to find would be a series of academic lecture halls, at least in terms of the initial impressions. Certainly, there were more open-air training grounds that were more free-form, but for the purpose of them simply observing and studying at the same time, these were where Amelia led them. The halls had wooden seats behind wooden desks that one would expect of a lecture hall, though they overlooked a wider staging area. Instead of slate and chalk and a podium, there were racks of weapons, magical tools and assorted things, and an open area. There was a magical barrier between the observation stands and the training ground proper, something Ellesandra might notice by the faint magical sparkles that rest in the corners where the supporting wooden pillars met the overhanging ceiling, clearly dividing the observing area and the staging grounds for whatever training was going to happen. There were others present in this chamber, and the hallway they walked through that had the door which entered into this space was one of many, suggesting there were quite a few more training rooms just like this one that people could move between if they wanted to see what else was going on in the different spaces. The one they walked into was chosen mostly by way of it being closest to them. The clash of metal on metal could be heard as soon as they walked in; two men in full plate practiced with dulled swords that had flat points on them, but were still very much made of metal. Longsword fighting, it seemed. The two armored men were overseen by another man with a scruff beard in more ornate plate mail who stood in gruff observation. Just swords, no shields. There was a gallery of eight other figures without helmets but still in plate mail that stood in the lower arena off to the side, observing what were presumably fellow students. Star and Amelia shuffled through the wooden stands to find a seat that allowed the three of them to sit together, Amelia on one end, Star in the middle, Ellesandra on the other. Whether it was chance or something Amelia did intentionally, the group was positioned such that to Ellesandra's left was one of the intersecting vertical stairs that allowed observers to ascend and descend the lines of wooden seats. Something that ensured nobody could sit beside Ellesandra, and gave Ellesandra quick exit and ability to pull Star with them if needed. Not that it'd be needed, but Amelia may or may not have picked up on the knight's paranoid behaviours. Once they were seated, the two girls picked a book each and began into their studies. The swordfight practice continued until one egregious error was made by the man on the left. An over-committed overhand that telegraphed far too heavily when the other was still on guard. This earned the man on the left a swift pommel strike into the front face of his helm, which knocked him off balance and onto his ass with an expected grunt of pain. The observing master then stepped in. "Ahh, Bathus, what in Bahamut's name was that, eh?" he asked, moving to grab the man, Balthus, by the arm and yank him back up to his feet. "Been reading too many fiction books on heroes who go in for final blows before earning them, 'ave you?" He then roughly shoved Balthus back towards the group of other students. "Do me a favour, you lot, take yourselves back to the pits and don't let Balthus here have his dinner until he's practiced the regiment of guard breaks a thousand times. And the next time I catch any of you tryin' to pull any heroic shit as that, it's a hundred pushups and twenty laps in full plate, and double that the next time. An' if I hear a word of bitching, you're all doing drills in yer' skivvies for a week. These blades'r dull, yeah, but they're still leave ya' more purple than an eggplant fer it, so get outta my sight!" he barked, earning attention from the students, who then moved off as commanded. There was then a pause, as it seemed there was a changing of who would be using the space, with some more people moving in and out to make adjustments to what equipment was available.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra followed along, dropping off the bought clothes nicely on one of the bed and then following along to the library, tucking the books she was given beneath her left arm without really looking at them much. She followed along to the training area next, focused on mapping out the direction and location in her mind so that if she ever needed to navigate these halls without Amelia or Amara, she might be able to - at least a little. When they got there, her eyes were peeled for any potential trouble, taking in what might be natural risks, but seeing that there was some sort of magical barrier between them and the actual training ground was a little reassuring. Sure, that didn't mean something couldn't still hurt them from there, but that there was something there for protection was nice. Whether it was intentional or unintentional, Ellesandra did appreciate Amelia leaving her on the end, and even more so that it was her left side. She assumed that bit was unintentional, though maybe Amelia had noticed her fighting with mostly her left hand, or had done that because of Ellesandra's injury to her right arm during the fight. Either way, she would sit the books down nearby lightly and ensure that both Amelia and Star were comfortable, one hand coming out to lightly brush Star's shoulder in a gentle comforting motion. She wasn't sure how Star's emotions might be with actively continuing their mission right now, but if she was feeling nervous or anxious or anything about her mother with the refocus on this, Ellesandra wanted to reassure her. The touch didn't last long, simply a fleeting reassurance before Ellesandra took in their surroundings again, and then turned her focus down onto the training pitch. This was just in time to see one of the knights overextend, which resulted in the expected punishment of that. Her eyes flicked between both knights, then the others down in the training ground, listening as their trainer or commander - she wasn't sure the relation there - scolded them. It set up in her a feeling of...nostalgia. Positive nostalgia, a feeling like this was something close to 'home' for her. Obviously she'd never been to Myst, but no matter where you were you had places like this, and the training yard was where she had spent so much of her time growing up. So needless to say, she was quite comfortable to just sit, appreciate and enjoy the ambience while watching for whoever would be coming in for the next training. She did keep glancing around up in the stands, just a casual sweep of her gaze, to not forget that she was on guard duty, but otherwise she watched the grounds.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled at the reassurance, letting her eyes linger on Ellesandra for a moment just to give them the warmth of her smile and appreciation for their thoughtfulness. Perhaps even more so now that there had been the spark of romance between them, Star had nothing but positivity to pour into her companion's presence when they were being kind and thoughtful towards her, shared with smiles and sweetness behind those sparkling blue eyes of hers. She did have work to focus on, and she did so, but every so often she might just gently lean her head on Ellesandra's armored shoulder for a few minutes, or lean against them a little, or just turn to look and make sure the knight was still content. She could see the nostalgia in them. The positive emotion. The familiarity of it all. It reaffirmed to her that she made the right choice in insisting on this. It wasn't for her. She could only imagine herself on the receiving end of such scolding and just turning into a blubbering, sobbing mess for disappointing her trainer like that. She was too sensitive for that life. But Ellesandra liked being here, and being near Ellesandra while they had a chance to just be happy for a while did a lot for Star, too. It helped her find her center. It helped her breathe easy. Some chatter came about while Star and Amelia studied, the two idly discussing some things they found in the books that were notable. Early conjecture, nothing of particular substance, but affirmation that accepting Amelia's help was a boon. Star and Amelia were clearly able to commiserate on arcana, though listening close it would be clear that Amelia did know more than Star about the subject. Still, Amelia didn't speak with superiority on it. In fact, Amelia looked delighted to be talking about it, and in helping Star in general. A sweetness to Amelia that had been hiding under the bratty exterior showed itself around Star. As the two did their study, the next occupants moved in. A group of staffers using magic floated in what was clearly a piste, though it had more than the typical fencing markings on it. The fencing markers were there of course, identifiable in white lines across the piste, but there were also red marker lines, and blue marker lines. A multi-purpose platform for duels of various sorts, it seemed. A host of figures poured into the training area. The group was led by one man, one woman. The man had black hair and a long, black coat, leather gloves, and carried a golden staff etched with runes in his right hand, which was long enough to tap the butt on the ground with each step. The woman had wavy brown hair and wore a set of feminine robes with a dark, sleek, silk cloak that draped over her shoulders. There was a gathering of students falling in line behind them. Amelia's eyes widened when she looked up. "Wow...Professor Yami, and professor Chamberlain?" she mumbled to herself. Teachers, it seemed, though that seemed obvious enough. "Right," began the man, tapping his staff twice on the wooden floor. "Reiterating for all of you students, and for our esteemed observants," he said, briefly looking up at the stands and making a motion with one gloved hand at the audience before lowering it again to address the students more directly. "Today we'll be doing practice examinations. These won't count for marks, but you should be treating this as though they do. Professor Chamberlain is here to observe and officiate, and will be giving you a mock grade. Once you've all had a turn at the mock exam for spell dueling, there'll be some recreational fencing if you wish to partake with whatever time we have left," explained the man. The woman professor then shot a hand up, sporting a wholesome and adorable smile. "I'll be fencing, but I suck, so now's your chance to get revenge on big bad teach for all the alchemy homework she assigned you!" said the woman, evoking a round of chuckles from the students and the male professor. The man pat the woman on the back a few times. "Ah, don't be modest, I'm sure you've improved. You're certainly better than me at it, yes?" he asked, earning a sarcastic quip from the woman in turn: "Professor Yami, I'm still not convinced you've worked out which end of the rapier goes towards the enemy. In fact, I'm certain you took one look at the thing, said 'this blasted hunk of metal can't cast spells'," she said with a mocking impression of the man. "And then cast it into your magical forge to melt it down for its base metal to form back into a necklace of fireballs or something," she said, sporting a cheeky smile. "So beating you hardly counts." Another few chuckles. Professor Yami included. "All right, all right, enough joking, professor Chamberlain," he responded, moving to step onto the piste on one end. "Let's not waste time. Come, first up, let's see what you've learned." Professor Yami stood casually behind one of the blue markers on the piste, with one of the students, who sported an oak staff with a purple crystal sphere at the top, moving up to take position opposite him on the opposing blue marker. "When you're ready, Sevra," said professor Yami. Sevra, the woman who stood opposite him, took a moment to concentrate, then thrust her staff forward, hurling a purple bolt of mana at professor Yami, who responded by thrusting his hand that held his staff forward, keeping the staff vertical, to produce a magical wall of force that impacted the bolt and dissipated it. He then twisted his wrist and flung the tip of his golden staff in a downward arc that produced a series of eight blue bolts that shot back at thrice the speed of the student, catching them off guard as they attempted to mimic his action in producing something to stop the bolts, but failing as the bolts hit her across her shoulder, torso, and hip. Her body jolted, suggesting the bolts had an unpleasant sensation associated with hitting her, but it was obvious they were otherwise harmless. "Do not overcommit to offense, Sevra. Be ready with your shield spell. It won't always be harmless bolts flying at you, and your shield spell may be the only thing that stops you from being skewered. Now, do it again, but this time, ready your offense while keeping your arcane shield on a hair trigger in your mind," he said, then readied for another round. Professor Chamberlain was idly making notes on some parchment that she produced from seemingly nowhere. A quill in hand was matched with an inkwell floating next to her. Probably not good marks. Star seemed interested in the goings on, though Amelia was very much enthralled, enough to be distracted from her studies to some degree.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra noticed the brushes on her arm, or how Star sometimes leaned into her. She didn't comment on them or encourage them, though she also didn't pull away from them either. She had been silent through the newcomers entering, even when Amelia made a surprised comment about who it was. She watched the arena change with interest, eyeing the obviously magical students. Was this place an exception to the no magic rule, or did these students somehow have permission that escaped the basic enchantments that disallowed arcane usage? She didn't ask, considering this while listening to the back and forth between the supposed professors. They were putting on a good show for the students, at least. Likely making a few chuckle, or easing tension and nerves for some of them. A good display to do that, and to get them into the best possible fighting mind. Fighting when overly nervous was never going to result in stellar scores. She leaned forward, elbows on knees and watching with rapt interest when the magical fight began. Her eyes traced the bolts that were blocked, and then returned. The corner of her mouth lifted in a small smirk when the returning bolts hit the student and had some for of impact - though obviously not deadly or fatal. The reminder to balance offence and defense was a good one, and she glanced over to Professor Chamberlain where she was making notes. Were those shared with the students, to give more detailed feedback, or just a grade? After a moment, she pulled herself back and did another glance around the viewing area, ensuring nothing had changed from a danger perspective, before looking towards Star and Amelia. Amelia was obviously also just as enthralled with the training as Ellesandra was. "Is this a rare occurrence?" She asked softly, so as to not interrupt Star if she was still successfully studying at all.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Huh?" asked Amelia, drawn away by the question. "Oh, well, it's more...To have direct instruction from either of them alone is extremely fortunate. Professor Chamberlain is a peerless alchemist. She has a lot of published works in the archives, as does Professor Yami. Professor Chamberlain is known to be a little eccentric, but the alchemical elixirs she's able to make would make your jaw drop. She could make an elixir to alter just about anything you could think of, make you grow extra arms, make you thirty feet tall, all sorts of restoratives and curatives, toxins, potions that make you fly, make you able to speak to animals, turn you invisible...Obviously to some degree people will embellish, but she and Professor Yami also a members of the Closed Circuit. Anyone who is a part of that has the sort of knowledge in their respective field to be considered an elite. Amara is also a part of it, though that is less on merit and more because of her position. Don't get me wrong, the captain is an incredible fighter who I've seen do some amazing things. It's just...Those two professors are on another level I guess. Professor Yami is an artificer. He's an exceptional wizard whose brain I'd love to be able to pick some time, but to him I'd just be a fledgling student of the arcane. You'd have to find something of exceptional rarity or power, legendary books or wonderous items to evoke his interest. Stuff like the Book of Exalted Deeds, or a Deck of Many Things or something." Amelia sighed longingly, clearly looking at both of these professors with admiration. Star smiled, watching how Amelia was possessed by such admiration, but kept her thoughts to herself and kept at least most of her focus on her books. As impressive as it all sounded, she couldn't let it distract her from the quest to save her mother. As Amelia spoke, the duel went on. Professor Yami went on to instruct his student, showing such a divide in mastery of the arcane that bordered on boredom, but there was a clear focus on his student. Every motion was studied, every incantation, every subtlety was scrutinized, and firm but focused corrections were issued. Of course, the students went up one by one, and none of them were able to so much as come close to catching the professor off guard. To be in a fight against this man was surely a death sentence, though thankfully he seemed to be a wise teacher concerned entirely with bettering his students, rather than showing off. They couldn't touch him, no. There was no chance of them scoring a hit. But he instructed them to refine their form regardless, like a drill instructor having a swordsman practice on a straw dummy. It wasn't about doing any damage, it was entirely about refinement of form. There were a fair few students to go through, and each time a student had completed, the student had praise given for the things they did right by Professor Yami, and they then were ushered over to speak to Professor Chamberlain, who spoke privately to them, presumably about what they needed to work on, as one might discern from the gestures and demonstrated stances and motions that were done a few times in repetition to cement them into the student's mind. Certainly, professor Yami had plenty to critique in the moment, but it seemed anything that didn't benefit the class at large was taken to be addressed privately. The students seemed in good spirits through it all, though there was some clear fatigue after they went through the motions. The bolts might be harmless, but they still needed mana. Nothing a handful of minutes of rest wouldn't fix. Yet even as professor Yami went on, hurling ten times the amount of bolts as each student, he seemed nowhere near breaking a sweat.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded at Amelia's answer. So they were both essentially experts in their fields. It made her even more interested in watching how they fought and taught. Obviously it wasn't a good example of them going all out and fighting, but it would still be a good example of how they handled themselves against students, as well as how their students were doing. If all of the students were performing poorly, it was a good indication that they weren't ready for what was being taught - and that was on the professor, not the student, when it might be the whole class like that. Ellesandra wasn't an expert at fighting. Oh she trained a lot, and she was more skilled than your average soldier was, maybe even up there with a few elites, but to be on the level of absolute expert? She knew and fully accepted there were people better in swordsmanship than she, not only because of her limitation with her right arm but also in just pure skill. Hell, Amara was probably better in physical combat than she was, based on what Ellesandra had seen when they fought against the black knight. Yet, she wasn't the type of prideful person who wished to be that; instead she was the type of person who sought out the people who were best in their field to learn from. For them to teach her where she was messing up, not for the goal of being the best but for the pure enjoyment of improving and being better at her job. And so, despite this being a magical duel and not one in swordsplay, she watched. It wasn't like she didn't have her own magic, even if it didn't take the form of the magic she was watching. Ellesandra's magic all focused around improving something about herself or her weapons and armor. She could enhance her magical defenses, make herself faster, improve the sharpness of a blade to cut through the hardest of materials - but she couldn't randomly send out magic missiles at a target like some of the bolts she saw below. The shield spell was one she'd tried to learn, but her magic just didn't do it right - for whatever reason. She'd made her defensive spell from it, but it wasn't the same as the shield being used to deflect the bolts below. No, if the bolts were coming at her she'd likely take a few of them directly at a reduced impact and throw them back. That or use terrain as cover. She mostly watched the students, and specifically listened to what the professors called out as things to improve on. These were what Ellesandra could learn from. So, other than glancing around occasionally, her focus was mostly entirely on the training in front of her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It was clear that this exam was meant to push the students, who were able to handle spellcraft well but had plenty of room to improve. The students were clearly competent. A few looked disappointed when they were clearly humbled before Professor Yami, as to some it was dispiriting to see just how much farther there was to go when one believed they had already come so far. Others took the instruction with determined acceptance, something that Ellesandra could liken to how they might take it. An understanding they were facing a superior, but the whole point was not to win but to lose and find out how to improve in the face of that. The students collectively performed well, and though professor Yami was clearly looking for things to call out in his students, it was balanced by equal praise, even if they were just short shouts of 'Good!' and 'Again, like that!'. Reinforcement of the positive was just as important. When all was said and done, Star had worked through one of the books entirely and moved onto the next. They weren't particularly meaty books, and much could be skimmed, but it was a good hour or two before the students had finished. There were subtle motions in the magic that Ellesandra could interpret, certain incantations, that might allow experimentation with their own magic, but it truly was a different style that would require focus to adapt to their own methods, and might offer minor refinement to existing techniques as it reinforced the importance of deliberate somatic gestures and purposeful and powerful verbal command to evoke magic properly. With that done, about ten minutes were taken in rest and review, before a staff member arrived with a rolling wooden cart that had fine wood cases for training rapiers. Professor Chamberlain moved to take one, shedding her cloak as she did so, and replaced professor Yami on the piste after a moment to put her hair up in a ponytail. "All right! Now that official class business is over, I challenge any and all who would daaaaare take on their teacher in a duel! For those of you who aspire to be spellblades, your participation is mandatory!" she declared, her tone playful. Professor Yami interjected: "No it isn't." This had professor Chamberlain putting one hand on her hip and throwing a pout at the man. "Hey. Hey. Shut up, okay? I'm the one with the stabby thing right now, don't test me," she said gesturing to the blunted rapier in her right hand. The man chuckled, clearly meeting her playful tone with equal light-heartedness. "You're still about as threatening as a pile of kittens even with a blade, you know." A comment that had the woman rolling her eyes and scoffing. "You're not helping. This is serious! Now just stand there and officiate for me, would you?" she fired back, giggling as even her attempt to sound annoyed failed her. The professors clearly had a strong rapport, and the positive energy had smiles and small laughs from the students, one of whom took up the challenge to step and stand across the piste against professor Chamberlain. Professor Yami wore a smirk and folded his arms, standing in the proper position to officiate as the two duelists approached with the traditional ceremony of vertical blades raised as they approached in lockstep, meeting one the white en garde lines. Then, professor Chamberlain took her offhand and weaved a spell that had a burst of blue energy push down onto both participants, causing their limbs and heads to briefly be surrounded with a shimmering blue light that dissipated soon after. Only their torsos did not light up, the only valid place to strike an opponent in such duels, of course. The tips of each rapier then shone with a soft red energy as the two readied themselves. Professor Yami called out the expected calls, beginning their duel of rapiers in earnest. Professor Chamberlain proved to be the superior swordswoman against this student, but Ellesandra would easily be able to see the errors pile up. The student was too much of an amateur to capitalize, but professor Chamberlain was also clearly not an accomplished swordswoman. An enthusiast, certainly. She knew what she was doing. But if Sia was present and coaching professor Chamberlain, it wouldn't be pretty. They did say it was only for recreation, after all. Something professor Chamberlain was trying to learn, and naturally shared that process with her students. It still made for a good show, with neither of them being so obviously superior to the other that it was one-sided, but either of them against Ellesandra would need some serious luck to score a hit.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra continued to watch, appreciating how Yami went through the students and gave them criticism. The positive comments were kind of shrugged off - honestly felt too hand holdy to her, but she was trained by Sia. A compliment from her meant you did really, really well, and that meant a compliment from her meant so much more to Ellesandra. Then again, she understood that type of training didn't work for everyone; some people didn't enjoy the learning as much as she did, and needed that more consistent positive feedback to keep them motivated. She glanced over to Star once as she switched books, just a brief check in to make sure she was doing alright still with the studying, before turning her attention back to the fights. As the magical training finished and the cart of training rapiers came in, Ellesandra sat even further forward. She was looking forward to potentially seeing instruction in a weapon, though as she watched Professor Chamberlain take a rapier and trade wit with Professor Yami. There was a spark of attraction - interest in this woman as she wielded a blade. Her eyes scanned the Professor, respectfully and not quite lewdly like some might in trying to undress with her eyes, but more an appreciation and interest. If Star noticed this, though, there was a...difference from the attraction Ellesandra felt for this professor, and the attraction she felt for Star earlier. This was very focused on the physicality of the woman, appreciating the way she looked and being interested in that way only. With the attraction she'd felt for Star, it wasn't just physical appreciation. It was interest in Star as a person, being attracted to her overall and even more when she was wearing her current cute outfit. And as the training began, there was a brief spark of disappointment. It became very evident immediately that Professor Chamberlain wasn't exactly 'skilled' with the blade. This didn't dim the attraction, and the disappointment left quickly. It wasn't like she would have gotten an opportunity to spar the Professor anyways, so it wasn't like she was missing out on the chance to learn from a supposed expert. It was still interesting to watch as they more...play trained, considering the Professor wasn't experienced enough to offer a full training session to the students and made multiple mistakes herself. A soft "T'ch" came from her, shaking her head. They were going to learn more bad habits that way than they would good; beyond simply getting used to the Rapier as a weapon and extension of their arm, being trained by someone who was still this early in their learning career just meant they were being taught the teacher's own bad habits.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There certainly was no actual instruction happening in this bout. Professor Chamberlain was not a master of this and she knew it. It was, as had been said, recreation. Practice, rather than training. The professor wasn't using this chance to instruct or discipline, as she herself wasn't a proper mentor for it. Though regardless, Star certainly did notice the attraction. It was just physical attraction, naturally. She had seen plenty of that. But there was still something that...Stung about it. Enough to sour her mood and leave her grumpy. It wasn't like she had any security in her heart that Ellesandra wouldn't be motivated to pursue this attraction. Ellesandra wasn't...Hers. And while the logical brain might be fine to believe that it was surely the more likely scenario that pursuit of such attraction would lead to, at most, meaningless sex, that neither had any bearing on Star's shot of jealous pains nor did it particularly help even if it did occur to her. No, she didn't have any claim on the knight. But that didn't mean she could be emotionless as she saw them fawn over another woman, nor did it mean she wanted to think about them having sex with someone else. It just meant that, even as this jealousy festered in her and made her do all she could to focus on the book instead, she just...Said nothing about it. There was nothing TO say. Star had been smiling when Ellesandra had checked on her prior to the swordsmanship being displayed. But the next time Ellesandra checked on Star, there wouldn't be any smiles to be seen. No explanations for it, of course. But she wouldn't even return the looks if any were given, not as any form of punishment or anything of the sort for Ellesandra, but only because her own feelings for the knight made the whole thing messy. She was still glad they came here of course. She could see how attentive Ellesandra was. She could tell they were having a good time. She just needed some time to sort through this emotion, like any other. Amelia looked over at the 't'ch' and rose a brow, then smirked. "...Kinda makes you feel like stepping in and showing everyone how it's done when you see people less skilled than you at it, huh?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't notice the change in Star, not at first anyways. It wasn't until after she turned to look at Amelia when Amelia spoke that she looked to Star and saw the change in demeanor. No smile, not meeting Ellesandra's eyes, and seeming...down. Ellesandra wasn't reading her aura, but something had definitely changed. She wasn't sure what, and glanced back up to Amelia to answer her. "No, I'm not a teacher and would not be the one to show them 'how it's done', per say. I've no pride about my skill, only in the intention to learn. What they're doing is.." She waved a hand, unable to find the right word. Play and recreation like this was harmful to learning of the art, in Ellesandra's mind. Even if the Professor wasn't actively teaching, this type of practice, without a goal and more for fun, served little purpose. "Harmful at worst, useless at best." She finished. After explaining this, she turned to look at Star fully though. "Star, have you found something?" Ellesandra didn't even think about how her attraction to Professor Chamberlain was likely noticed. If she had considered that, she'd have realized that it probably bothered Star since Star had obviously implied feelings for Ellesandra, but she'd been too focused on the training and what was going on to think about Star recognizing that. Instead, she assumed the change in mood was that she'd found something in the books that spelled bad news for them.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia giggled. "Sheesh. And here I thought I was stuffy about my art," she said, playfully chiding to Ellesandra. There was an implied respect for Ellesandra's dedication to it all, though she didn't seem to agree with Ellesandra's characterization of it all. Professor Chamberlain did come out as the victor of the bout, taking one hit while the student was struck the rest of the times. Proper respect was shown for the ceremony of it, playing out otherwise as a bout should. The two then stepped down, with professor Chamberlain allowing students to face each other for a few bouts. The students had potential, and the practice was allowing them to refine what they did know to some small degree. Meanwhile, Ellesandra's question to Star evoked a small shake of her head and a soft "No." and nothing more. For someone who certainly could be as talkative as Star, a single word response was...not unheard of, but a bit unusual. Certainly wasn't what was bothering her, it seemed. Amelia looked at Star, then at Ellesandra, then back to Star, then out at the training grounds, as if trying to figure out what was up herself, though said nothing on the matter.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra frowned and concern flared up when Star just gave a brief 'no' to it. Her eyebrows scrunched up while watching Star, though she didn't say anything. The thing with Star was, she was typically more talkative about things that bothered her and her emotions. If she wasn't sharing something right now, it probably meant she didn't want to talk about it here. So Ellesandra reached out and lightly squeezed her shoulder, to give some encouragement and reminder that she was there to help if needed, before turning her attention back to the training. The difference, though, is that she didn't remove her hand, keeping it there as a supportive gesture for as long as Star would allow it to be there. Ellesandra also, by habit and also intention, kept the barrier up between their emotions. Which meant unless the jealousy was so overwhelming Star couldn't hold it back while touching, she still wouldn't recognize it for what it was. She was instead watching as the training bout wrapped up with the Professor having won the most hits, though she'd taken one herself. Despite her criticism for how the bouts were being held, she still watched with relative interest, and didn't verbalize criticism again.

Star didn't resist the hand, and the emotional wall did mean there was no leaking of her jealous feelings. There was part of her that appreciated it, part of her that wanted to squirm her shoulder out from under Ellesandra's hand. That was the jealous part. The part of her that wanted to emotionally lash out and storm off, telling the knight to go fuck the teacher already. But not only was Star able to recognize just how...Utterly out of proportion that all was, she also knew that it was all just a knee-jerk reaction. All just a perversion of her ACTUAL desire to be the one Ellesandra couldn't take their eyes off of. And with the time to process it, the time to let it feel and ride out its natural conclusions in her heart, she was able to take a slow, calming breath that then exhaled. And with it, some of the jealousy faded away, fluttering free and away from her. It was all new to her. This...Jealousy, this side effect of romantic attraction. She was able to deal with it. She just needed time and a little exposure to it. She still felt its bitter claws tear at her, but she stood calm in the storm. It was unfortunately rather distracting from her attempts to study. Time passed, and the recreational swordfights concluded. The professors dismissed the class for the day, and then went off together after professor Chamberlain retrieved her cloak. Some of the people in the stands had come and gone as the time and subject had passed. People were polite and quiet as they moved about. Occasional conversations were ongoing, but quiet and kept to the small groups, just as Ellesandra, Star, and Amelia had done. The training grounds were quiet for a time, and it was about twenty minutes before the next group arrived. This group was led by a dragonborn instructor who had bright golden scales and wore a heavy set of plate mail with a red cape. A tower shield in one hand, a longsword in the other. The students that joined along with this instructor were donning armor, varied from half-plate to full plate. Each one had a shield and their choice of martial weapon, each of the shields bearing a holy symbol. Straw dummies were set up for them, and the instructor began a brief lecture to remind the students about how to properly harness divine magic, as would prove to be the subject of the practical lesson, though for the immediate it was just talk of how one embraced the power from their oaths. More than a few of the students had the same symbol, however, which was the same one seen all around the athenaeum - the symbol of the Followers of Myst. There was no god or goddess associated with that symbol, so it was curious to see it being used as a holy symbol, and in divine magics instruction.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't just fuck everyone she was attracted to, and probably would have been a little insulted at Star saying that if she had. Not that she would have been against having sex with the Professor, other than knowing that Star had feelings for her and being concerned about how that would play out. Either way, she kept the comforting hand on Star's shoulder and gave a light squeeze. Eventually she pulled it off just for the comfort of not keeping her right hand held up like that, but she kept their shoulders touching. A constant reminder that, for whatever was bothering Star, Ellesandra was there. She watched as the class ended and then left, letting the silence of no current training wash over them. Even with that, Ellesandra felt more comfortable here than she had in recent history with Star. It wasn't that she was less comfortable with Star herself, but more just the area. It was fancier than what Ellesandra was used to, with the magical barrier and the stands and the obvious use as training grounds, but it's overall purpose was the same. She relaxed here, though still with her guard up for anyone who came close or might be watching them. During that 20 minutes, Ellesandra would have reached for one of the smaller books that hadn't been touched by the two magic users yet, more idly flipping through it and doing what scanning - as inefficiently as it was - she could. Whether or not she found anything interesting - she didn't expect to, and was more doing it out of a small bit of guilt at letting Star and Amelia do all the research while she just sat there - she paused and looked up when she heard people heading into the training area again. Her eyes fell on the obvious plate armor and the symbols they had, it taking not long at all to see that it was either a cleric or paladin training session. She kept an ear on it and watched them use their magic and the explanations given, but her interest in this was obviously less than the interest in the previous bouts. Whether that had been from being attracted to the professor or topic might be unknown to Star, though in reality it was mostly the topic. Divine magic always escaped Ellesandra, and as none of them seemed to be of a deity she personally related to or followed - or some didn't even look to be of a deity - her interest was more a casual observer here.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was going through a lot, not because her feelings were particularly intense - she longed to be the one in the center of Ellesandra's eyes, but she also knew she had no claim on them - but because it was, by Star's own admission, the first time she'd ever been in a situation where there was the prospect of mutual attraction. The new territory had the raw feelings burning through her and making her think things she didn't truly mean. Things she would regret saying aloud the moment she said them. It was only by the grace of her already strong command of her own emotional state that she was able to keep a clear head about it. After the storm of emotion had passed, she took emotional stock of herself, and realized that this whole time, Ellesandra was making small motions to keep a comforting presence on her. She knew it was there, but the other emotions distracted from it. Focusing on that small, thoughtful action was enough to be the icy bucket of water splashing over her head. She audibly sighed, briefly closing her eyes. She was being...So stupid. And though it might have been a little forward, she slid her left hand down between them to find Ellesandra's right hand. She gently took their hand in hers and gave it a squeeze as she opened her eyes and looked over at Ellesandra. A warm smile was given for their thoughtful support for an inner battle that they might not even realize Star had been fighting. She knew that hand holding was a bit forward, however, so she planned to release if she felt discomfort from the knight at the touch.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had noticed that Star was off, but had no idea why and had just assumed that she didn't want to talk about it while in public. Which was odd in and of itself for Star, but would have been perfectly normal for Ellesandra if she'd found something odd in the readings and she didn't want to share too much about her origin or magic with Amelia. So, Ellesandra hadn't questioned it, just tried to offer support while watching the paladins - or clerics? - train below. When she felt Star sigh, there was just a glance over to make sure she was okay, a glance at Amelia to see if she knew any reason why Star was upset, but assuming there was no indication she just went back to her observation. When Star reached down and took her hand, though? There were multiple things that happened at once. Confusion, surprise, and - and her heart skipped a beat. Those feelings, locked away, flared up. Butterflies happened. Nervous anxiety, unsure what to do from that. All of this happened in just a moment or two after Star took her hand, and Ellesandra had stared down at their fingers linked in the obvious surprise. Her eyebrows had scrunched up, unsure what to make of this, and then she looked over at Star with...concern. Was whatever was bothering Star so bad she felt the need to hold Ellesandra's hand? Because Star's feelings for Ellesandra, though they'd been implied previously, weren't the first things to come to her mind. Instead, Ellesandra assumed that whatever had upset Star had done so so much that she needed to hold onto Ellesandra for the support, similar to how she needed a hug when finding out about her mother. "Star." Ellesandra muttered quietly. She didn't take her hand away, and squeezed Star's in what was intended as a supportive option. "Do you want to go back and finish studying in the guild hall? Or chat about something?" With Ellesandra actively deciding to focus on there being a potential problem, the feelings that had flared up slowly died back down. Not forgotten, and still there. But kept in their cage to not be focused on, like Ellesandra was so good at doing.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia was very much doing her own thing, offering only a brief side-glance when looked at that quietly said none of this was any of her business. Though there seemed to be something lingering on her. Something unsaid. Something that also briefly caught Star's attention as she looked vaguely to the side as if trying to look at Amelia while her head was actively facing Ellesandra. A lot of things seemed to be being left unsaid in the moment. Star focused on Ellesandra, though, and their muttered words evoked a small amount of surprise. She considered the words for a moment. Her heart throbbed briefly as the amorous emotions in her heart made the impressive leap from what Ellesandra actually said to the interpretation of 'studying' being more cuddling and kissing and a lot of other things that Star ought not to be thinking about in public. But that was briefly shoved aside. No. Bad Star. Down, girl. Ultimately she gently shook her head. "We can chat later, if you still want to," she said softly, with the gentle warmth to her tone restored. But seeing that Ellesandra wasn't fighting the hand-hold, she was slightly emboldened to just...Let that gesture linger. Armored gauntlets on the knight's hands meant it wasn't quite the touch she truly desired, but it was good enough. She then returned her attention to her book, not shutting off from Ellesandra but simply trying to refocus. If they had more to say, she was happy to talk. She just was going to need to resist the urge to lay her head on their shoulder while reading now. While this all happened, the paladins below set about doing their drills. This group seemed capable, a bit more advanced than previous groups. The dragonborn leader addressed them strongly, but not like a drill instructor would new recruits. It started with exercises to get limber, then became a show live weapon fighting. These were not training weapons. They were very much lethal blades, maces, warhammers, axes, and the like, all well-cared for with edges sharp and blunt faces, well, shiny and blunt. The instructor briefly addressed the audience by clarifying that these fights were in preparation for final examination, and that injuries were going to happen, and blood would be spilled. There was an offer for any who felt they could not view such things to leave. One person in the audience did indeed get up and depart at the warning. Star looked briefly uncomfortable, but not enough to say anything. The instructor went on to explain that this training was as much about martial ability as it was training defensive and curative powers, and that there were extra healers on standby to ensure nobody would suffer permanent injury or death, clarifying further that all the students had on them the magic of a Death Ward, which would trigger should they sustain lethal injury and place them in a safe, stable condition that prevented death so they could be healed. Seemed that the show that was about to play out was one where nobody was holding back.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She wasn't quite sure what to make of all of this. And though there was something inside her that really enjoyed holding Star's hand, she wasn't let the hold continue for that reason. She was concerned about Star, and assuming that Star needed that type of physical touch to feel better, since Star was a much more tactile person. Or at least, that's what she told herself. It was partially true, to be fair. As they continued on for some basic drills, and then the instructor gave warning that they would be live duels, with magic to protect eachother but that there would be bloodshed during the duels, Ellesandra leaned forward. Her interest was peaked much more, and though she glanced around to see the one person leaving and doing another visual sweep of the room to check for threats, her focus quickly returned to the fights. While Star might feel uncomfortable at this, Ellesandra looked and felt excited for these fights. Oh, she wasn't excited for bloodshed, specifically. No, she was excited for seeing real fights where people weren't holding back. To watch people give it their all, knowing that their opponent wouldn't suffer any fatal injuries. Sure, there was an aspect that knowing you yourself couldn't suffer a fatal injury would lead to you being a little more reckless, but overall this was the closest she'd get to watching real fights here. And so, her eyes stayed on the combatants, looking more interested than she had even when the hot professor was using a rapier - poorly.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's discomfort was only momentary. Yes, she disliked violence. That was where the knee-jerk reaction came. But with a bit more careful consideration, thinking that it was all under supervision, that these people were comrades fighting not to hurt each other, but to better defend themselves when it was truly an enemy that was trying to kill them. Necessary violence to prevent tragedy later. It comforted her, though she still didn't particularly want to watch it, even knowing how necessary it was. All the more focus on her studies as the first bout began. A human male wielding a warhammer versus an elven male wielding a longsword. Both had kite shields. They moved into the center of the room, everyone else stood far away to give them a wide berth of room to engage one another without interference. The two shook hands, nodding to each other with smiles, then took a few paces away from one another. The smiles gave way to serious expressions as each donned their helmets then drew their weapons, and an unseen crash of cymbals announced the start of the fight. The human man took an initial offensive, charging forward while the elven man rose his longsword up in the air as golden shields of light shot out from around him with the magic of Shield of Faith. So it was that when warhammer met the readied shield of the elven man, it bounced off with a golden flash of light and made the human reel back. The elf moved to capitalize, only to be met with a staunch shield bash from the human, forcing the elf to defend and miss the chance to land a punishing strike. A series of full-on, traded blows ensued, with each strike being met with practiced, refined blocks, parries, and movements to balance offense and defense. All the combatants were of the same fighting style - frontline combatants who were intended to lead the charge and hold the line, combatants tenacious enough to stand tall in even protracted engagements and keep fighting, so it would be that these bouts would each take quite some time. After a series of traded blows, with neither side gaining much ground on the other, the human managed a solid parry with his shield that opened up his opponent, and rather than go for a typical strike, he leapt up and raised his warhammer high as it began to shine with bright golden light, so that when it came back down to meet the swiftly produced shield of his opponent, it resonated with a powerful BOOM of magical force that knocked the elven man back with force enough that there was visible fatigue in the elven man's shield arm. Something might have broken from that strike. The human pushed his advantage by going for a second strike, but the elven man stepped forward and was enveloped by silvery mist that saw him stepping through his opponent with a Misty Step and appearing again behind the human to swing with a circular horizontal strike as he pivoted on one foot, slashing at one of the gaps in the human's plate to bite into their skin as his sword, too, glowed with golden magical force to produce a similar boom of magic. Smites. The hallmark attack of a paladin, expended eagerly in this fight to make the strikes they did manage to land that much stronger. The blade ripped through the chain shirt the human wore and earned a loud cry of pain from the human as blood was sprayed onto the wooden floor. The human responded by straightening his posture swiftly and pulling his arms against himself, surging with mana that caused an explosive wave of force to burst from his chest, which forced the elven man onto his backfoot as the explosive force knocked him off balance. When the human turned, he gave a quick nod at his opponent while both caught their bearings again. A respectful gesture to acknowledge a good hit. The elven man returned in kind, his shield arm clearly weaker as it failed to assume as firm a stance as it had at the start. The human took a few tentative steps back, putting some distance between them. The elven man allowed the distance, not because of mercy or friendship, but because it was clearly mutually advantageous; each man used their magical healing to restore themselves in that moment. While there was a chance to keep pressure, the choice to restore themselves was more suited for their combat role of sustained fighting. It also meant that the two were able to go right back into a series of blows and counterblows that showed just how much stamina they had trained in themselves. Ten minutes of fighting, and neither seemed to be tiring significantly. It was similarly clear they weren't holding back; Ellesandra would be able to see the weight and intention behind each thrust, each swing of their weapon, and how hastily they had to interpose their shields against incoming attacks at times. They were certainly trying to kill each other, but each had greater defense than offense, and they were still, ultimately, trainees. Mistakes were subtle, and few and far between. They had refined their craft and learned from masters. They knew what they were doing, and were going all-out. Rage-fueled shouts were plentiful as each gave all their muscles could sustain into each strike, and each were undoubtedly sweating buckets under their armor. But they fought on, trading strike for strike, smite for smite, with some attacks sending the other off their feet, and one incident in particular saw the elven man hitting the human with a smite that had the human burst into flames under his armor, which evoked the expected cries of pain as flames shot out from every gap in his plate. Yet even that wasn't enough to stop him, and the fighting continued with occasional intentional backsteps to heal themselves as best they could. Blow for blow, strike for strike, spatter of blood for broken bone, block for block again and again and again, until ultimately, the elven man tripped the human and went in for a diving, plunging strike with his longsword that looked sure to hit square in the chest, only for the human to roll just enough to take the sword in his shield-arm's shoulder, crying in pain but having the perfect chance to swing his warhammer up and loudly CLANG against the elven man's helmet. A moment of pause happened, then, before the elven man slowly just...Toppled over to his side, blood trickling out from under his helm. A blow to the head that, without the death ward, would have caved in the elven man's skull. The human man lay there, sword jutting out of his shoulder, panting, and fell limp, totally spent. There were no applause or celebrations. Instead, the healing staff mentioned previously ran in, separated the two men, and magically began tending to the wounds of each. Motion in the elven man after some healing showed they were still alive, and a few minutes of tending to each would see them able to at least sit up, stable. But each of them was definitely going to need to rest, and were sure to get some feedback about what they did well and poorly in due time. Then, it was a matter of cleaning up the significantly bloodied arena before the next bout would begin.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched with rapt attention as the two men really went at it. There were a few times she winced, including when the smite on the shield obviously damaged the mans arm. She could imagine the pain from some of those blows and silently commended them for fighting through it. These weren't brand new trainees, or people inexperienced in their particular craft. These were, while still in training, decent fighters and knew enough that it wouldn't be a 'quick' bout for either side. At least, not unless one really stood out amongst the class. She winced again when the blow to the head happened, almost as if it rang out and she knew that there was going to be a victory there. Even if the other didn't collapse from that, it'd certainly disorient them enough to be finished off. Still, as he collapsed and the healers ran out, she also leaned forward to watch them heal and make sure the men were okay. There was a minor bit of envy at this. Ellesandra had never been able to practice bout like this, considering her resistance to healing magic. There was always too much of a risk that someone would give her a truly fatal blow that wouldn't be able to be properly healed due to her unique...magical limitations. Oh she'd gotten injured plenty while training and sparring, but it was always something that was planned to be less serious of blows than not. A broken arm here and there, breaking a finger or bruising something badly. She'd even had a bad fall once that popped her shoulder out of socket, but nothing like what the two men were experiencing below. Being set on fire with a searing smite, a full on blow to the head, stabbing through the other's shoulder - none of those were fun experiences that your average person would want to experience, but for Ellesandra it meant you were really giving it your all, and thus able to learn more from it. This was why she was envious of the opportunity. Either way, as the two were getting healed up and the next bout was preparing to begin, she looked over to check in on Amelia and Star again. Star, to see if anything had changed about her being upset about something, and also to see if she was feeling comfortable with the direction these training bouts had taken. She surely hadn't expected them to be suddenly trying to mock-kill one another below, and she'd said before she wasn't great with killing. "We don't have to stay here if this makes you uncomfortable." She offered to both of them, since she wasn't sure how Amelia felt about it.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia gave another typical side-eye with a raised brow, as if not even understanding what could be so bad about what was going on that she could be uncomfortable. The instructor said it all. There was no real danger, outside of some freak accident nobody could predict. But living in Myst had taught Amelia that, within these walls, within the athenaeum, everything had been accounted for when it came to training. There were no accidents. At least not ones that didn't have proper intervention ready to go. But looking at Star, Amelia seemed to pick up on things a bit more. Star wasn't visibly uncomfortable, no. She looked fine. But Amelia put two and two together. Must be something that Star didn't like, so she added: "No big deal either way, I'm fine to stay or move elsewhere." A small signal of solidarity with Ellesandra's efforts to ensure Star was comfortable, if nothing else. But Star had seen the envy in Ellesandra, the excitement at watching. She didn't personally 'get' it. But she didn't have to. Ellesandra was enjoying it, and that was enough for her. So Star just smiled at Ellesandra and shook her head. "Honestly it's...Better they have such support around when learning these things. It's a bit too much for me to watch directly...Makes me a little queasy, really...But I can tell they don't want to hurt each other." She could see a lot of good in the hearts of the trainees, too, but she refrained from sharing that. It didn't take a magical sense to see they were all vaguely friends or at least had mutual respect for each other enough to not actually enjoy hurting one another, however. "Besides. I can tell you're enjoying it. I'm glad you agreed to come here. Much more enjoyable for you than just whittling or trying your very best to stave off relentless boredom, don't you think?" Star said with a smile. "Tell me about what you like about this. I like hearing about the things you like."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. She wanted to say that it didn't matter if she enjoyed it, the fact it was making Star queasy was enough to go back to the guild hall instead. But then Star asked her a question, and she sighed, knowing that it was a distraction tactic. Even if it wasn't intentionally one, it worked as one. "I never got to train like that. They're passionate about this, take it seriously, and are able to go all out. I'm sure there's a bit of factor in that they know they can't actually die during the fight due to the magic on them, so they might be a little more reckless than they would be in a real world scenario, but they aren't afraid to completely give it their all and fight as if it were a real world scenario. Because of how magic works on me, that type of training just...wasn't possible. There was always a chance someone would injure me in a way I couldn't truly be healed from." She shrugged, turning her attention back down to the pit. "So it's nice, being able to see them giving it their all. Fun to watch, anyways. It can be an art, fighting. Both in posh, well orchestrated ruled show bouts, but also this type of fighting. This is the fighting that you can see applicable skill, see how someone would handle themselves in the situation. That's exactly what needs to be trained into a lot of fighters. Just add in some elements of surprise now, to keep them on their toes and their awareness up, and you can simulate most of what you'd experience in the real world." She glanced over to Amelia. "It's like appreciating the art of another magic user, I'd think. Everyone does it differently, but gets to the same result. And some people are just, better at it. To learn from people who are much better at something than you are is nice, really."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled. She truly was fine to be present here, though she was honest to a fault in admitting how violence was hard to watch. But she placed Ellesandra having a good time over any discomfort she might feel. There was a warmth to her that blossomed out from her heart, showing on her face as she listened to Ellesandra explain. These were things that her powers could not intuitively tell her. She could understand some amount of baser reasoning behind an emotion, but nothing as detailed as this. Nothing that truly explained why someone felt a certain way on complex matters. At least, if it was possible, she wasn't good enough with her powers to yet discern such things intuitively. But even then, people tended to be happier when they spoke about things they liked. "You don't have to tell me what it's like want to learn from someone better than you," said Star with a smile and a pleasant giggle. Star wasn't without her own barriers to getting better at her art, after all. There was exactly one person who Star could learn from, and they happened to be looking for just that person. And oh, did Star have such beautiful memories of when she was able to learn from her mother. Those good memories were all that kept her from feeling sorrow in thinking about the fact that her mother was still lost to her. "Maybe someday I'll figure out a way to heal you that would let you do that sort of thing. I think that'd be nice, even if it'd be a little hard to watch you get hurt, even knowing it was controlled like this," said Star, thinking aloud. Naturally it seemed she wasn't considering her sympathetic healing to be an appropriate tool for such things, as she knew Ellesandra would never approve of her taking on the agony of Ellesandra's wounds for anything short of an emergency. Meanwhile, Amelia gave another sidelong glance. "What're you looking at me for?" she grumbled, blushing just a bit as she averted her gaze. Not sure what to make of the glance, Amelia just defaulted to her huffy, pouty self that had thus far been absent. Star giggled. "Your dedication to the arcane really is worthy of praise, Amelia," said Star. "I'm sure there's people who would love to learn from you. I'm sure there's a lot you could teach me, too." An earnest, heartfelt set of words that hardly would be surprising coming from Star, but it still seemed to strike an arrow in the right place in Amelia's heart, causing them to blush up a storm and clam up, bringing the book they were studying right up to their face to cover their cheeks while grumbling something unintelligible. Star just smiled, then looked at Ellesandra with a knowing smile. "Was there anyone besides Sia you would say you ever found you could learn from, or look up to in terms of martial skill, Ellesandra? I imagine most knights you knew preferred a longsword or something. I'm...Really not sure how transferable the skill is between a rapier and other weapons like that. I mean. Obviously. I don't think I've ever even wielded a weapon before, eheh.." She was still holding Ellesandra's hand through all this, of course. If they weren't going to let go, neither was she.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched Amelia's reaction to the compliments and smirked to herself. There was amusement, as well as a familiar sense of protectiveness over Amelia - not that she'd ever actually let Amelia know that, because she'd likely be offended at this bit. There wasn't any of the attraction though, so Star's senses would hopefully not pick up anything jealous worthy. Amelia was cute, but didn't seem to be her type. At the redirection back to her, though, Ellesandra tilted her head to the side, looking at Star curiously. "You saw the memory in which I was using a longsword and shield, Star. I didn't always fight with a rapier. I believe I mentioned my default weapon before I came into my magic was a spear and shield, and then just a spear once I did with a shield on my back for optional use. In fact, it wasn't until my right arm was injured that I really used a rapier as my main choice of weapon. I was trained in it previously of course, I've gone through extensive training in most common weapons." She then turned her head to look back at the training field. "And there were plenty better than me. I mentioned Aeras before, he certainly was better than me at hammer and shield. Because I'm a spellblade and because of my ability to absorb and redirect magic, my focus was never really on fighting soldiers one on one. I was trained as a counter against magic users, initially. Until I enlisted myself as a guard, I was being setup for a special force to specifically go against magic users in the field, if they were encountered." She glanced between Amelia and Star again at commenting on that, not wanting to make either of them uncomfortable with that knowledge. "Once I changed that path, I started focusing on more personal ability, but anyone who is truly skilled or good at their art can beat me in a martial fight, no magic included. I'm sure Amara would wipe the floor with me, magic or not."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star saw nothing that would trigger any jealousy. In fact, that protectiveness over Amelia was something that made Star smile even more. Knowing they would get along rather than have friction around one another was calming. Comforting. Star always preferred when people got along, after all. Star looked a little flustered when being told about the memory she already had seen, and yes she did recall it, but she hadn't known specifically if Ellesandra preferred the rapier or what the cause was for choosing it, or if Ellesandra had preferences for other weapons. So rather than just think about it aimlessly, she asked: "I see. Well, if you could fight with any weapon, if your arm was healed, what would you fight with?" she asked, tilting her head. "I mean, I'm sure you remember that I do want to heal your arm. I think I can do it. It just might, well...Take a bit, is all." And might result in Star having some anguish in her own right shoulder for a while, but she wasn't going to draw attention to that. Neither of the two seemed uncomfortable with Ellesandra being a mage slayer. Seemed that Ellesandra being their ally made any worries about it vanish. If anything, the little flick from Amelia's ear might indicate that she saw it as a compliment. Someone needing to be dedicated specifically to kill her because she was so dangerous? Yeah, she could take that as a bonus to her ego, sure. Star just simply could not envision a scenario where Ellesandra would ever want to hurt her, so it never could make her uncomfortable. "Probably important that we remember to let captain know that, in the event we do get into a fight again," said Amelia offhandedly. "The whole...Mage-killer thing. Magic users are probably captain's greatest weakness, after all." All comments said from behind the safety of her book, naturally. Still hiding her face.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She took some time to consider the question about what weapon she'd prefer to use. She hadn't answered or come up with an answer by the time Amelia offhandedly mentioned they should tell the captain that. She looked over, tilting her head. "You two plan on fighting with us again?" Were they hoping, or planning, to come with them to Gurhal? There had been mention about sending scouting parties there, but she wasn't sure if Star had felt comfortable with that or would agree to it. And even if others came, whether it would be Amelia and Amara hadn't been confirmed. Either way though, she turned to add to Star. "I'm best with Spear and shield, martially. Though I'm a bit out of practice with it, seeing as it's been about three years since I really wielded either. I'm...fond of the rapier though." She didn't specify why, and honestly Star wouldn't really need to ask why. There was a mixture of grief and...emotional attachment to it. Marigold had used one, and Ellesandra had trained her in it. The rapier would have a nostalgic place for her, always, and she doubted she'd ever entirely stop using one. Maybe not as her main weapon if her right shoulder was healed - which was a big if since Ellesandra would entirely resist the sympathetic healing for it, or really any healing - but still available and a comfort on her hip.

"No I think next time one of your six trillion enemies show up I'd just stand off to the side and place bets with the captain instead," said Amelia, lowering her book to give a playfully sarcastic look at Ellesandra. "But to seriously answer your question," she hastily continued, obviously knowing the point wasn't whether they would stand shoulder to shoulder with the knight but more whether their paths would diverge in Myst. "Whether you want captain and I to come along with you directly or not, I'm finding it pretty likely that Serenity will dispatch us to Gurhal, once we figure out how to get there. It's not a very good first impression for the archives to turn up so few books on a plane like this," she said, motioning to what they had before them. "Because you'll just have to trust me when I say it's typical that if you wanted to pull all the information there was in the archives on a single plane, it'd be thousands of books. Maybe tens or hundreds of thousands if it's a place as well traveled as Faerun or as magically significant as the Feywilds or something. So you can bet that it's in the interest of the admins of Myst that SOMEBODY bring back knowledge from Gurhal." She gently shrugged. "Just seems like the natural conclusion that, if you two are in want for company and a bit more security on the road, that we join you. There'll just be some terms to figure out, I guess, if it plays out that way." That all explained, Amelia focused back on her book. Star had a few things to consider between the two topics. The next bout had begun down below while they were talking. A silver dragonborn woman with a shield and longsword against a dwarven man with a two handed maul. Just as the last, these two gave each other no quarter, and the sound of metal on metal served as the backdrop to the conversation. "Hmm. I guess shield and rapier is kinda a weird combination?" Star asked, innocently. "I can't say I'm against you having a little more in the way of defense, with how hard it is to heal you. But you're right that I can't really imagine you never using your rapier. It just seems to...Fit you, I guess."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra considered what Amelia said. More security on the road would certainly be nice, in all honesty. Especially knowing that they were actively walking into what would probably be multiple traps between wherever they came out at, and Star's mother. She turned her attention back over to Star though, as she commented on rapier and shield. "I've seen it done before, but it's awkward. Rapier's are designed for one handed use with your other hand being a balance to your movements. Having a heavy shield in the offhand would throw off a lot of typical fighting maneuvers. They're designed to parry and slip under guards, not go head to head against a longsword for long bouts." She shrugged again, turning her attention back down to fight, more watching it mindlessly while talking now. "It does add protection, but keep in mind I need a hand free in order to use my magic. There are shields that strap to your arm as well that would still allow that, but they're not usually designed for the ease of movement a rapier demands. Even my armor gets in the way sometimes. I've grown accustomed to instead using the rapier as a way to redirect weapons and then sliding into their guard instead." There was no comment about Star saying the rapier fit her. But it was something that tugged at one of those locked up again grief emotions. One that caused her to momentarily have to clench her teeth and push back down, before continuing on with her explanation. "A rapier works well with spellblades in general because they're light, easy to use, and can be done smoothly with a lot of magical abilities. They make the most of my haste spell, for example, because they're based on being quick and flighty. If I were using my normal spear, it's slower overall. A haste spell, while still beneficial, won't have as much of an impact when using that versus a weapon like the rapier."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"You've certainly put a lot of thought into this, not that that's really surprising," said Star with a smile. She felt the grief, and while it wasn't something she intended, she also felt it was important that Ellesandra be able to feel it. Now wasn't the time to process it, but she thought perhaps she might be able to talk that out with them another time, if she could discern more of the root of that feeling. "Then maybe there's a way instead to empower your defensive magic. You having a natural resistance to magic has been helpful so far, but maybe there is armor that can have a similar effect to these clothes, something to further your speed..." Star thoughtfully pursed her lips to the side for a moment. "I couldn't help but notice all the stock they had in the guild shop. Price was a bit beyond us but...If we could find a way to make a bunch of money, or come across it in our travels, I'd say it'd be a good investment to get you something better, if anything caught your eye. Really I...Have been meaning to talk to you about combat related stuff for a while, honestly. Even if it's just tactics...There's undoubtedly going to be a lot of fighting ahead of us. So I think it'd be important for us to have these kinds of conversations. If all it takes is a little discussion to prevent future injuries, then it's silly not to, right? I might not be so good at offensive magic, but my magic can be used for a lot of things that would help give you the upper hand. Not that I could practice anything here, but...There's a few things I never really brought up in the past about our resonance that could help us be more effective together." Naturally, as Star explained, Amelia's attention was drawn in, to the point that the term 'resonance' had one brow raising. Star's magic was still a mystery to her, after all.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She frowned at the idea of them spending any more of their money on armor for her. She'd of course seen the guild stores, and how much of it looked certainly better than her current armor, but she hadn't even considered getting anything there. Not only did she not consider the 'party fund' hers to use, she also knew that even if she did, they didn't exactly have enough funds to do that while also surviving on their remaining funds for their journey. "I appreciate the thought, Star.." She said, releasing Star's hand but only because she was turning fully in her seat, readjusting how she was sitting so she could face Star full on. The comment about their resonance and using magic to help one another had her glancing at Amelia briefly before back to Star and refocusing on the topic. She wasn't sure how she felt about other people knowing they had resonance, since it felt...personal somehow. But she also wasn't focusing on that right now, anyways. "We don't have the funds for that, and the type of money that would be needed to buy such a thing isn't something we could just make easily panhandling on the street. I tend to make a few gold per guard job, just taking one merchant caravan to the next city and such. I could potentially get more if I hire myself out as an adventurer to go slay some beast, but not only would that potentially be putting our main mission on hold, it would involve danger for you if you went and that's directly against what I'm here to do. And don't pretend you'd be comfortable with me going on a mission like that alone." She added the last bit quickly, knowing Star well enough by now that she knew Star wouldn't like that idea. "I'm quite fine as I am I think, though I agree when we have time, we should discuss your capabilities in more measure and how we can work together on the battlefield. As long as doing so isn't putting you in danger."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was a little sad to let the handhold go, but she didn't fight it. It was longer than she had expected it would last, so she could be okay with that at least. She was a bit surprised to see Ellesandra turn to face her directly, but she shifted slightly to turn diagonally towards them in respectful matching of their body language. She smiled at her companion of course. "I'm not looking to put either of us in danger, Ellesandra. And I certainly won't be panhandling, nor have I ever saw fit to purchase a shiny new set of clothes if it would leave me destitute," she said, pulling attention to her...Shiny new set of clothes, implying she knew they were fine to purchase it with their funds available. "I'm not saying we try to get it immediately. I did say the price was beyond us right now, didn't I? I'm not going to do anything reckless, but I think it would be equally reckless to not put some of the funds towards protecting the frontline fighter." Star was electing to use more tactical language to make it make more sense to Ellesandra. Of course, she didn't care if Ellesandra was a frontline or backline or no-line or squiggly upside-down line fighter. She wanted them safe. She didn't want to see them hurt. But if it took talking tactics to achieve it, so be it. "Not that it's a competition, but how do you think I've survived on my own? People are more than willing to pay for magical healing services, particularly in places where magic is scarce. There'd be steady work for me in Hotenz if I needed something to do, though I admit that's based on my understanding of it rather than actually having ever been there. Much as I am eager to move forward, we have to prepare for what we both know we're up against." She paused, giving Ellesandra a more serious look. "It's more than likely that armor would have killed us both if we were alone. And that doesn't even begin to compare against the magic I felt resonating from the jerk who summoned it. This isn't just me being sentimental. This is me wanting to keep us both alive. I need you by my side, Ellesandra...And the better equipped you are, the better you'll be able to keep me safe, too." She gently smiled. "We're going to make it through this, together. And I think we both know that we'll have to both get stronger to face the perils that are waiting for us. I might have gone head-first against the pirates, knowing I could make it out alive. But I'd never be so reckless unless I knew I was coming out the other side okay. And after what happened to us just before coming to Myst, well...I'm feeling a lot more cautious as we get ready to head to Gurhal." Star already did have a healthy preservation instinct of course but...Knowing how important her safety was to Ellesandra, particularly in relation to their mountain of grief and trauma? Star might just end up half as paranoid as the knight by the time they were to head to Gurhal.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She...sighed. The thing was, Star made good points. She had to admit it to herself, even if she wanted to disagree with the idea of them going out of their way to do this in order to get her armor. "We can improve by fighting together, using your magic to cover me. If we find an opportunity to get money while we're going and then have the option, sure. But I don't want to delay what we're doing just to get me armor." She didn't want to say why she didn't want to delay for that reason, either. Maybe Star would get it, but the idea that they'd arrive a day or two late because they decided to go off and do some healing jobs for money in order to buy Ellesandra better armor or equipment would - well, that would haunt her. There was real fear that doing something like that would result in something bad happening as a result, and the memory with Sia came back. She already had the death of a charge on her mind, she really didn't want the death of Star's mother on her mind as well. She pursed her lips for a moment, then nodded. "But I'll relent, if we have time and get the money anyways, then sure. I'll look to find something that works for me in one of the shops around town, or the guild hall if that's still open to us at that time." She didn't want to assume so. She did look at Amelia as she said this though, knowing that they were guests of the guild for now and not wanting to assume or be ungrateful about being able to remain such.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile, though she wasn't entirely satisfied by the answer. "...I know, Ellesandra. I know what you're thinking. At least...Part of it. It hurts me just as much to delay. But there are thousands of delays I've already allowed that could be just as much to blame if the worst comes to pass and we find ourselves just barely too late. I'm focused. I'm driven. There's nothing I want more than to charge straight to my goal. But rushing out and dying isn't the answer just as much as sitting around working for years to make sure we have the absolute best possible things money can buy before we set out. There's a balance. Reasonable times to pause, short term goals that benefit the long term objective and may result in saving more time than they cost. A week of work early enough that saves a month of resting off injuries that you end up not sustaining from the better equipment pays for itself in time and in ensuring you have to deal with me fussing over you that much less," she said with a sweet, playful smile. "All I'm asking is that we be smart about this. It'll take more than just us fighting together and good tactics if the enemy ahead of us is so much more powerful. Trust me it's...Always been hard for me to accept money from people in excess of me being able to afford what I needed. Knowing what I know now, I would have gravely regret it if things played out differently and I had returned the money to Morrun. It's...An adjustment for sure, knowing I'll have to take all I can get. But it's for the best. Preparedness is one major part of keeping ourselves safe." She then looked more directly at Ellesandra. Directly in the eyes. Words then followed that meant more than she was saying: "I'm not going to die on you. And you're not going to die on me, either." Both her hands came to take one of Ellesandra's. She knew she was riding dangerously close to a point of grief for the knight, so she was hopeful that her encouraging tone, her firm stance on prioritizing safety, would offer some comfort to Ellesandra. No recklessness. No martyring herself. They would do this intelligently. They would do it together. That's how they would stay alive. Amelia, not wanting to interrupt, kept to herself. But she was half-listening to anything that didn't seem personal. And at the look, she gave a little nod. They'd figure something out, one way or another. Amelia might have an attitude, but she seemed...Happy. Not that she was actively showing it, but...Her insistence to keep close to Star and Ellesandra, if one read into her actions, suggested that she was finding friendship in the two of them, so it was the natural consequence that she'd want to support them if she could, which included leveraging her guild membership.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She hated that Star was right, and that she agreed with her. It made sense, even if she hated admitting that. Shaking her head, she tried to find a logical reason not to do any of this, but she didn't have one. And then Star reached out and took her hand, and there was a gut wrenching pull on her stomach at those words. Ellesandra did an amazing job, all being said, of keeping a stoic face at the grief that was pulled out again at those words. At the acceptance and guilt that was there because, in all honesty, Ellesandra was fully prepared to be a martyr, to die for Star. She'd do it without blinking an eye, with zero regrets as long as she knew she was setting Star up for a successful mission, or to not die herself. The only real sign that there was emotional turmoil, on the outside anyways, was her jaw muscles flexing when she clenched and resisted grinding her teeth. "No death." She agreed, after a much more pregnant pause than the comment deserved to what would be Amelia's point of view. The thing was, Star would be able to see that Ellesandra didn't truly believe what she was saying. Oh, she fully meant no death for Star, but for herself? She might be careful to not upset Star with her death, but if it came down to it death for her was still an option. One which she wasn't as against as she should be, in all honesty. But Ellesandra didn't want to dwell on that topic, or that thought or emotion, and knew that Star could see it. So instead, she involved Amelia in the conversation. "Amelia, do you happen to know of any potential leads on...making money? Considering Star has a great ability with healing and - well, I can absorb magic if it's necessary. That sometimes helps with curses, for example, or cursed items."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wasn't happy with what she saw. It frightened her. Terrified her. It was the sort of passive suicidal acceptance that truly had the capacity to let Ellesandra make a martyr of themselves, and Star was juuuuuuuuust stubborn enough to get some dangerous ideas on the matter. That the two of them could theoretically end up in a fight against one another for who was going to ultimately sacrifice for the other was absurd, and something Star had to push from her mind only because she knew that either of them sacrificing wasn't the answer, but she struggled to find a way in her mind to explain that to Ellesandra in a way that made sense and addressed the deep emotional turmoil that the knight felt. And though Ellesandra was pulling a so very typical distraction into their conversation, Star wasn't going to let it go without the last word. She squeezed their hand tighter and said, quietly, but firmly: "No. Death." Two words that had the unspoken implication of acknowledging what she saw in Ellesandra. Amelia, not hearing what Star said, responded naturally to Ellesandra's question. "I'd say you could make good money joining the Followers of Myst, but I've gotten the sense from you both that that's not really your cup of tea. Sooooo...In lieu of that, if you want work here in Myst, there's options for that. There's probably some contacts that captain has in all sorts of planes that could set you up on that front, buuuuut...Somehow I doubt going somewhere that isn't Gurhal is what you're looking for." She then shrugged. "And I've never been to Gurhal, so Star is gonna know way better than me what making money looks like there."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked at Star with the squeeze and the words. She didn't argue, didn't respond to it, but you didn't even have to be Star with her specific Aura magic to read that her silence was an attempt not to rock the boat, not because she agreed with Star. It was, in many ways, her literal job to sacrifice herself for Star. And even if it wasn't her job, there was the depression and it lending to her feeling specifically that Star's life was worth more than hers. Hell, a lot of people's lives were worth more than hers, in her eyes. So there was essentially a silent agreement not to say anything or argue about it, but she didn't really agree to the no death. She wouldn't do something to get herself killed if she could avoid it, but she was comfortable accepting it too. That darkness didn't leave, the thoughts now brought up, as she turned to listen to Amelia entirely. She frowned at the thought of joining the Followers of Myst, at least before their mission with Star and finding Aurora was complete. A shake of her head was given at that. "If Amara is sending us to different planes than Gurhal for jobs I'm not sure that would behoove us, considering the urgency of the mission and the potential longevity of such a mission as that." She turned back to look at Star. "Any ideas?" Again, keeping the conversation off of that darkness. She was sure Star would bring it up later, when they were alone, but she was at least buying herself more time without it now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Oh, uh.." Amelia began again. "Amara wouldn't be your captain unless you were specifically part of the First Crusaders. Most Followers of Myst do not organize into teams like that and act independently or with their own adventuring groups. The Frist Crusaders are a specific group within the guild with a specific purpose. As it stands, there's a very present objective to go to Gurhal, enough that I'm sure Serenity will send us, or if not us then some other people, with you. Though obviously choosing two guild members with rapport makes way more sense than two random people," she said with a shrug. Star was tactful enough to not push the issue here in public, but the look on her face was definitely a 'we'll talk about this later' sort of thing, as the knight expected. When asked for any ideas, she gently shook her head. "Like I said. We can start our journey in the star plane if we have the option and go to Hotenz city. Our ultimate goal is the moon plane, and there would be work there to do, too, but the concentration of work would be highest in Hotenz. As would the availability of resources. I believe the Guardians have their central guild hall there, too." Another name, another guild. Commonplace enough; the elven settlement they had taken refuge in was more than likely part of the Emerald Enclave, too. The balance of acquiring resources against time was a difficult one.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra may have misunderstood something Amelia said, but it didn't matter. As Star laid out the plan for it, Ellesandra nodded. "Well, I'll be by you wherever you decide to go Star. Just point me in the right direction." She relented in regards to going to somewhere to make money first. She'd follow Star on her mission; she hadn't been hired to make the decisions on what to do or where to go. She'd been 'hired' as a guard, so she'd guard Star. If that included going and doing...whatever they were going to do in Hotenz for money, then she'd do it. She looked over to Star again and then squeezed her hand one more time, before turning her attention back to the training grounds. "Sorry for interrupting your studies. Have we found anything?" Bringing them back to the topic as well. She didn't have much more to say, since their plans were pretty well made out in regards to where they were going next.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a peculiar look at Ellesandra. "I'm not going to claim to know the best way forward. I'd much rather have your input on the matter, too," she said as she squeezed back and turned back to her books. The question of having found anything had Amelia speaking up: "So far what I've found is that Gurhal is shielded by a magical cipher. It's not entirely unheard of, Myst itself uses a similar sort of magic to protect itself from otherworld invaders. Illithids and the like. Also why your cards to get here are bound to you, so they can't be stolen and used to breach the veil." Amelia then gave a moment of pause. "...Trouble is, the way it's described sounds like it's not just a matter of having been there to be able to go there again. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if Star knew how to breach this cipher, she'd already have made a portal to get back there a long time ago," she said, looking to Star. Star gave a slightly embarrassed smile and a rub of the back of her head. "It was my mother who sent me away from Gurhal, as a matter of emergency. It's not like planar travel was something I was capable of at the time. I've figured out the basics since then, but a cipher..." she looked a little downcast at the notion. A roadblock she felt was going to take a long time for her to be able to cross. Years, even. "Don't worry," said Amelia. "I can figure it out. I just might need to confer with someone." She paused for a moment. "...Professor Yami is from Aetheria. There's similar magic there, so he might be helpful in breaking the cipher more swiftly."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to the input request. She had given her input though, and didn't really have much more input to give. Her eyes stayed on the training ground below while they spoke of the different ciphers and struggles with opening a portal to Gurhal. Ellesandra was listening still, but she was distracting a little bit of that darkness, and the dread of having that conversation with Star later, by watching the fights. When there was confirmation that Professor Yami might be able to help Amelia decipher it, she looked back up to Amelia. "Anything we can do to assist in that?" Ellesandra remembered Professor Yami as that magic professor who had wiped the floor with his students. Professionally and educationally, of course, but still. He had seemed impressive, and Amelia certainly seemed to look up to him. If there was something they needed to do to help, she would - but also she knew they were strangers, guests in this realm right now, and them just staying out of the way was an entirely valid thing for them to have to do. Her hands clasped in front of her tightly, the feeling of restlessness at just waiting bubbling up a little, but mostly being ignored.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia gently shrugged her shoulders. "Unless you have some immensely powerful magical artifact sitting in your pocket I doubt there's a way to get his attention professionally. I don't really have the clout to seek him out, nor anything to offer that would be significant enough. Not that it'd be impossible to convince him to help out of the goodness of his heart I suppose, but...It's just how things tend to go here that you'll get more from others if you have something to offer in turn. It'd be different if we were friends or something, but, nyeh...Best connection I have is that my brother is a student of Professor Chamberlain, and she seems to have a rapport with Professor Yami. But I'd wager fifty gold pieces that my brother just slacks off in her classes and chases tail more than he studies her lessons. So...Not feeling like that's the best angle." Amelia looked at the other two, as if wondering if any of what she said sparked any ideas in the knight or auramancer. There might be a few options to consider, though as charismatic as Star was, appealing to the man's better nature seemed risky. Not that it didn't seem like Amelia could figure things out on her own, but it might accelerate things if they could enlist more help. Truly, their quest in general would get easier the more allies they could acquire.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra glanced at Star, then back to Amelia. "Maybe not an artifact, but we both have pretty unique styles of magic he might be interested in. Not that you have to share if you aren't comfortable with that, Star." She offered Star a reassuring smile, but then back down to the training grounds, considering options. "Professor Chamberlain might actually be more interested in my magic than Professor Yami is, but I'm not sure if information on any of that would be enough to gain you an audience." She tilted her head back and forth, thinking about potentials with the gem that they still had, and then there was a light bulb, like someone knocked her in the back of the head to remind her of something. She turned her attention back to Star. "Do you think the tarot card might work? I haven't looked at it since coming to Myst, I assumed the limitations of Myst's magic would effect it, so it's in my pack back in the room. But you said there was some very powerful magic in it."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a mild pang of jealousy at what Ellesandra said. The notion of professor Chamberlain being interested in Ellesandra at all made her heart turn into a wild gremlin and gnaw at her to say something really dumb about it. She didn't, naturally, and managed to not show any sign of that flash of what amounted to fear in the face of Ellesandra being around that other woman they found attractive. When Ellesandra brought up the card, that had her expression raising in turn. She nodded. "Mn, it's certainly affected by the magic suppression here, so the magic is kinda dormant, but I mean...You ought to be able to feel its power, too, if you concentrate on it. It's...Immense." This, naturally, had Amelia quite interested as well. "Well...If you want to show me, I can see if it might be the sort of thing that would be on his level. Might be something he'd want to take a look at, for sure, if it's as powerful as you say." A notion that had Star looking a little relieved. One part due to not having to visit the woman Ellesandra was attracted to, and one part due to not having to talk about her magic and make a fool of herself with how her magic resisted natural explanations. It was hard to just...Talk about it. Ellesandra could understand it because Ellesandra had FELT her magic. But for Star to put it into words? The idea of her standing before a lecture hall made her want to hide under several layers of blankets and curl into herself.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't notice any of the jealousy, still assuming her previous bad mood had been due to something she'd read in one of the books. Instead though, she nodded at the idea of the card's power being an option. She was a little hesitant to show Amelia, only because it felt...personal. There was some trepidation at letting Amelia in on just how much her inner mind was defeated. How much turmoil there was going on in her. She hadn't had a choice with Star, because Star could just see it. Amelia couldn't, and this would be actively inviting her into that knowledge. It didn't mean she had to explain everything, but it certainly still brought some trepidation about it. Her hands wrung together for a moment while she thought, but eventually she would nod. It was necessary to ensure they got to their destination in a timely manner, and releasing some of her personal privacy for that goal was worth it. "If you come back to the room with us, I can get it out for you. It was given to me by a stranger, so I was quite suspicious of it until Star did an examination of it and ensured me it wasn't cursed or negative in any ways."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia was dumbfounded. "...A complete stranger just...Gives you a magical card of immense power? For no reason?" she asked, making sure she had the details correct, because it sounded...Absurd. "Fuck me.." she muttered. "What is with you two? Where's my random magical artifact of incredible power?" she continued to mutter just below her breath, not intending for either of the others to hear her. She kept on, in a more conversation volume. "Yes, I'd like to see it. And I sure as hell don't blame you for being suspicious, given those circumstance. Ready to head out then?" she asked. Star gathered her books, then nodded as Amelia did the same, still having an incredulous look about her. She was nearly at the point of resigning herself to just...Not question this stuff anymore.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let out a soft snort-chuckle. "You and I are on the same page there, Amelia. Ever since I met Star, weird stuff has been happening." She would nod as well though, moving to stand and doing a quick sweep of the area with her eyes to see if anyone was moving or adjusting with their own movements. Any sign of someone preparing to also leave, just 'happening' to be at the same time as them or anything like that. It was important to keep an eye on potential trails they had, if they had one for any reason. "If it helps, she implied that she just felt the need to do it, as if it was something she didn't really have control of. I don't believe in destiny, but if you do, then it'd be that type of thing." Ellesandra added for Amelia's benefit, taking a step back to allow the two mages to walk ahead with Ellesandra falling behind. Ellesandra would, as well, lightly touch Star's back briefly. Just a soft touch as they began walking, a reassurance again, before she went back to her normal following patterns without touching Star.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia let out a dejected sigh. She didn't much believe in destiny, but she also couldn't chalk up half the stuff that was happening to these two as just coincidence. It was too coincidental. Nobody just...Had all these things happen to them. There was nobody who seemed interested in the group of three as they stood, nobody happening to just be leaving at the same time. They really did seem to just be one among many in this place, and the population of this observation room was sparse already. The paranoia certainly had Ellesandra looking for the right things, if there was someone. But there truly, truly did not seem to be anyone who had any interest or business with the trio. Once they exited, a passerby happened to recognize Amelia, but all that did was just scare the young male student into stepping aside and away from Amelia - something that had happened more than once since they arrived. Amelia certainly wasn't just some nobody in this place, even if she clearly was also not among the ranks of the elites of Myst. Star gave a warm, appreciative smile over her shoulder when feeling the touch on her back. It was a gesture that clearly helped lift her spirits. The physical touch was important to her, that much had been obvious for a long while. The walk back to the guild hall was otherwise uneventful, and they returned to their room where the books were then dropped off neatly on the bedside table in two stacks while allowing Ellesandra to get this mysterious card from their pack.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Just because they were in a supposedly safe space did not mean she would take her job any less seriously. As soon as you started to slack, it was your fault if something happened you missed - this had been drilled into her by Sia over, and over. And then the punishment for slacking once still had scars on her back. She watched the student who stood to the side as they passed, but dismissed him once they'd passed and he wasn't near. It was interesting the influence Amelia seemed to have, despite not being an elite. And her brother was one of the students in the class earlier? Or maybe just one of the classes, not the one earlier. Either way, that intrigued Ellesandra a little. The quiet walk back to the guild hall was good, and when they got into their room she moved over to her pack. A bit of rustling as she opened one of the side pockets, and then she pulled out the tarot card that she'd been given. If it hadn't changed at all since arriving in Myst, it would still be at that 3/4ths defeated, 1/4th victorious state. If it had changed any in Myst, it would be just a bit less defeated, though still close to that fourth for victorious. A minor adjustment, but a little bit of one to recognize her having opened up a little to Star. Even if she still didn't accept it, and she still had that darkness there, it had been progress. She hesitated again, trepidation and shame settling in her stomach for a moment, before she turned the card over to Amelia while actively not meeting her eyes.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The card indeed had moved for Ellesandra. Slightly more of the victorious side was now showing. It was noticeable. When it was handed to Amelia, she gently took the card and peered curiously at it. A subtle swell of magic formed in her palms; it had been seen on multiple occasions that magic was still possible in Myst. Many were seen using it, and not just in specific areas. Amelia was one such person who seemed permitted to use it, though if Ellesandra ever thought to ask, the truth of the matter was that guild members of the Followers of Myst were permitted to use magic to a certain degree, and that freedom rose with one's contribution and trust within Myst. "Huh. Half and half...Triumph or defeat. Name changes based on how you look at it.." she muttered to herself, something that might affirm to Ellesandra that others did see the card only as it was initially. Straight down the middle. Only Ellesandra could see how it had shifted. Amelia studied it for a short time, going slowly more pale in her face, to the point that her fingers were ever so slightly trembling while holding the card. "Just...Who was it that gave this to you, Ellesandra?" asked Amelia, her voice showing a clear...Intimidation. Fear, almost. "You're not...Able to use the magic in this, are you? Just...In general?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was put on guard by just how much Amelia seemed intimidated and fearful of the card. Her hand went to her rapier casually, now concerned the card might be 'bad' in some way shape or form that Star might have missed. "Her name was Freya. She said something about being from somewhere called a Spire. She just happened to be in a tavern we were staying at, and when I went down to get our breakfast she was watching me. When I approached, she'd drawn this with magic, and explained that the card 'needed' to be drawn." Ellesandra had subtly shifted to stand between Amelia, the card, and Star, placing herself between Star and the potential danger. Amelia's reaction was definitely causing her caution, and she was prepared to respond quickly if somehow the card just...blew up, or summoned something bad. Could Freya have been working with the Cult of Faust, and/or Black Diamond somehow? If the tarot card was tracking them or doing something negative to them, it was good that Amelia was looking at it now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia went ghostly white with Ellesandra's explanation, though it was less fear and more...Once more, dumbfounded shock as her eyes fluttered. "The Spire? As in...The Lost Spire? As in, the realm that nobody has ever even been able to confirm exists? As in the realm with the tower said to present the ultimate challenge and thusly the greatest reward in all the multiverse, the power to defy the gods, to shape reality to your will, to have anything and everything you want if you do not succumb to its trials? THAT Spire? And what, this Freya girl just happened to like the way your hair looked that morning and decided HEY let's give this person a card that contains enough magic to BLOW UP all of Faerun if she is feeling particularly testy that day?" she went on, sighing, then slapping a hand to her forehead. "Sorry. Look," she said, handing the card back to Ellesandra as she noticed how tense they were getting. "It's not...Bad. It's not gonna hurt you. But there are not words potent enough to explain to you how powerful the magic within it is. The best I can say is that if you've ever wanted to punch someone so hard you cracked reality itself in half, that's your ticket to it. But...Like Star had said, there's a lock on that magic just as strong as the magic it's containing. The whole thing is dormant while in Myst anyway, but you need to...Make absolutely sure, without a shadow of a doubt, that this thing...Never...Ever ends up in the hands of someone who aims to do bad things. Because whoever figures out how to unlock its power...Could make an entire realm kneel before them, or be obliterated. Tch..." She then muttered: "Just happened to be staying in the same tavern...Fuck's sake.."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra wasn't sure how she felt about this explanation. That much magic in it? She eyed the card. Star had said it was really powerful, but she hadn't expected it to be deity level powerful. "She-" There was a pause. Did she tell Amelia that there was a way to unlock it? That the power would supposedly help her somehow, once one side of her internal conflict won out over the other? Ellesandra didn't trust well, and she glanced over to Star. They were going to be having Amelia and Amara as allies, weren't they? And Amelia was helping them find a way to Star's home plane. After another moment of trepidation, she continued. "The half and half isn't half when I look at it. The lock will be undone once one side fully takes up the card, based on...personal things. She implied that the power in it would give me...something. I'm not sure what kind of power, and it probably depends on which side 'wins', so to speak. So, there is a potential unlock to that power. Just not one that has happened yet."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star hadn't quite the propensity for colourful language as much as Amelia. If it wasn't such a serious moment, Star might have giggled at the choice of words. But to know it was all coming from some place, from some person, who was somehow connected to such a powerful thing, it just reinforced that there had been a lot of...Focus on the two of them. A lot of people far, far more powerful than either of them were taking interest in what she thought was truly just a simple quest of her getting, to put it mildly, a tiny bit lost and just wanting to go home. It troubled Star, making her worry that there was far more to this than just her desire to see her mother again. Why did other people care? It made troublesome feelings swell in her chest again, feelings that she wished she had just been born a normal farm girl with a pretty horse and some chickens to look after. That sounded nice. Ultimately, she nodded to Ellesandra when they looked at her for affirmation. She believed they could trust Amelia. And when the explanation went on, Star's heart dropped. She obviously knew what 'personal things' meant. So it was...The guilt, the grief, Ellesandra's own personal turmoil that the card was representing? And it had the ability to empower them, depending on which side won out? It made her...Fearful for what might happen if the dark side, the defeated side won. She was tempted to ask what Ellesandra saw when they looked, but...She had a feeling she already knew. Amelia drew in a slow breath, then huffed, some colour returning to her face. "Well...If that's how it is, then it sounds like it's bound to you, that you're the only one who can use it. So I hope to the nine hells and back that you're not secretly harbouring some plans of world domination." A half-joking remark. There certainly was the potential that THAT much power could corrupt anyone into doing something that created a terrible future for a lot of people. Amelia folded her arms, assuming Ellesandra took the card back. "I won't pry into whatever...'Personal things' means. But...If what I know about the Lost Spire has ANYTHING to do with it...It's a test. A test of you. The legends go that anyone who faces the Lost Spire will face the ultimate challenge of their life, something that tests one's moral compass, their mettle, their compassion, their empathy, their selflessness, determination, conviction...Everything about them. And for those facing the Lost Spire's trials, failure to surpass those trials means death. And success, well...Though it may surprise you to hear, there's not exactly a journal in the archives that tells a first hand account of Grognard the farmer who waltzed through the tower of a thousand floors and gained ultimate power and then told everyone 'hey I'm your new god'. Something like that would...Kinda make waves enough for us all to know about it, I'd wager.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt a smirk tug at her lips at Amelia's joking remark. "Dominating the world? The only thing-" She paused in her comment. She wasn't sure how Amelia would respond to the joke, and she knew for a fact her next words would have made Star blush up a storm. She glanced over to Star, amusement flicking even more at imagining how she'd react if Ellesandra finished that and said that the only thing she'd be dominating was the women in her bed. Not that Ellesandra necessarily played too much in that area, but it was one of those jokes that almost slipped out simply from feeling comfortable with people. That was...an odd feeling now that she thought about it. Either way, she shook her head. "I've been led to believe no matter which side wins I'll get some sort of power. But I don't particularly trust magic like this so...I have no desire to be a deity, that is for certain. Deities can all die for all I care, let mortals rule themselves." She paused, realizing that might have been a bit extreme. "Not that I'd use this magic to do so." She clarified, looking at Amelia so she didn't think Ellesandra was about to go on a deific genocide or anything with the power in the card. She cleared her throat, and then looked back over to Star and reached out again. A squeeze to Star's arm, so she also knew that Ellesandra wasn't planning on doing that. Star knew more of how dark Ellesandra's emotions were right now, but she wanted - no, needed - Star to trust her not to do something like that.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was an almost comical innocence on Star's face as Ellesandra failed to complete that joke and it sailed clean, far, and swift like a meteor in the night's sky waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over Star's head. She just blinked, the question mark all but visible above her head. Amelia, meanwhile, rose both brows. Oh, SHE got where Ellesandra was about to go with that, though she had no way to know of Ellesandra's sexuality, so the person being dominated was of indeterminate form. So, Ellesandra topped, huh? That was ammo for later. Star certainly saw merit to Ellesandra's way of thinking, though death still was something she didn't like to think about. That aside, freedom from influence and others impairing one's free will was something that Star certainly could get behind. There was trust in her that didn't need to be reaffirmed, but Star clearly appreciated it anyway. A nod was given, electing to just drop the other matter of whatever Ellesandra was going to say before. Star did have a thought, however. "Do you think it might be able to...Bring someone back to life?" asked Star to Amelia, not entirely sure if she wanted to know the answer to it herself. "In the event that something tragic happens, I mean," she clarified. Of course, her mind went to this mysterious M.K. person for Ellesandra but...There were other potential uses. If she herself died. If her mother was found dead. A contingency for such things, perhaps. Amelia gently nodded. "Could be. Hard to say if that's the shape the magic will take but...The force of power is there. True Resurrection is, I might even go so far as to say, almost a waste of the potential power, if it's a one time thing. But I can see why one might pick that over other uses."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was taken entirely off guard by Star's question. She stiffened and straightened, eyes flicking from Star to Amelia at the comment that resurrection was a true possibility. The thought obviously brought Marigold to mind, and that was enough to make Ellesandra entirely freeze up. The idea of resurrecting her had been brought up with her parents soon after she'd died. She didn't remember why they couldn't - well, more she wasn't really told why they couldn't and she was in too much of a 'state' to have the clarify of mind to ask. But if this card could do so? Grief, hope, shame, all conflicted within her at the idea. Anger shot up at Amelia just callously saying that resurrection would be a waste, but it was quickly taken up instead with grief. The grief struggled heavily and Ellesandra's obviously tensed posture turned away from the two women to put her pack back in the corner. She did not put the card in it again, slipping it into her legging pocket again at the comment about how powerful it was. There was a...numb feeling coming over her now. An overwhelmed response, where she emotionally had no idea how to process the idea of bringing Marigold back, and between the heavy emotions she'd felt the past few days and this, it was just her subconscious going 'okay that's enough'. Disassociating almost, though she still felt in her body and in control. "So, what's the next step?" Focus on work. Get that done. She could investigate this possibility, these emotions, another time.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star saw the grief, the shame, the hope. She loved the idea of hope. She loved the idea of Ellesandra getting a chance to undo the pain. Star knew that if it was her mother, she would want that chance. If she had power to do whatever she wanted, and her mother was dead? Reviving them so she could be with them again was a choice she'd make without thought. But she didn't want to promise false hope. That would be more crushing than anything. "So there's no way to know what shape it will take I suppose," she said, words meant to give context to the power, meant to not declare it a sure thing. Amelia nodded. "Aye. Not until the lock is broken and it reveals itself. Based on what Ellesandra said, it sounds like it could take one of two possible paths. I was just remarking on its potential strength." An explanation cut short by Ellesandra asking what was next. Star looked at them with sympathy, but she knew now wasn't the time. Amelia looked at Ellesandra. "What comes next is...Well, I guess it's up to you. We should find Professor Yami, but whether you feel the best option is to show him what you showed me, or take another approach, is up to you. Either way...We have to find him. Best bet is to check with Serenity to see what the teaching schedule looks like, see if he is giving a lecture. If not, could have him requested to come to the main office. Either way," she said, nudging with her head for the others to follow. Assuming they did, the trip was uneventful to be back at the main library services area, where Serenity was seated behind her desk with all manner of operational things happening behind her, books stacked in specific spots, and stacks of parchment looking to be sorted and processed. So very much bureaucracy to keep this city running, and Serenity seemed to be at the head of a lot of it. At least, the library part of it. Amelia took the lead, letting Serenity know what they needed, and it would prove to be that Professor Yami was in a lecture for the next thirty minutes, with the specific lecture hall being noted, which ultimately left Amelia, Star, and Ellesandra then having to go to the lecture halls. A place of similarly rigid and logical design to access them, it was a series of main hallways divided by logical discipline. It became a junction of sorts, squared to have one able to traverse along a main series of horizontal corridors that connected on either end with those familiar teleportation rooms that had various connecting options, with vertical halls up and down off the horizontal ones splitting off in different disciplines of magic. These were busier hallways, but there seemed a logical flow of foot traffic to reach the desired area. Artifice, naturally, was their destination, with the vertical hall having doors on either side leading to different lecture halls for different professors. Their ultimate goal was the lecture hall for Professor. A. Yami. But whether the trio was to enter and sit through another fifteen minutes of actual lecturing or if Ellesandra preferred to wait for everyone else to clear out before entering to speak to the man in question, was left up to the knight.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to Amelia, pointedly not looking at Star. She knew Star could see her emotions. Could she see the numbness? What did that look like? Either way, Ellesandra would follow along. To the library, to get his schedule. To the lecture hall, walking through the halls with a lot less of a focus than she normally did. Oh, she was still on guard, keeping an eye out for anyone following or anyone looking at them oddly, or anyone who got too close. But she was not being actively mindful of the terrain, the layout. She wasn't mapping the way back to the entrance in her mind in case they needed to escape for some reason, like she normally would have been. The numbness had spread to the point that once they got to the lecture hall, she'd looked towards the other two in confusion as to why they had stopped. It took a moment for her to realize the lecture was still ongoing, and Ellesandra would elect to wait until the class was over. Interrupting a lecture didn't sound like a good way to make this professor like them or more inclined to help out. She would position them so that they were mostly out of the way, and that she would be between Star and any of the students coming out of the lecture hall. She kept her eye out for the professor she'd seen earlier in the training grounds, or if he didn't walk out with or after the students, would step in to see if he was still in there, packing up or anything. She was about to motion Amelia forward, but remembered Amelia said she'd never really had any dealings with him, and that she didn't exactly have sway over gaining his attention. So, Ellesandra would approach him instead, clearing her throat and again, focusing on the goal. The mission. "Excuse me, Professor?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia and Star followed the direction given, waiting off to the side. A bit of time passed, the flood of students left the hall, and then the group poured in. The lecture hall was as one might expect. Entrance at the top of it, with a few sets of stairs that intersected rows of seats behind long wooden desks that were perfectly measured to stretch between the space provided by the staircases. Ordered and logical, as Myst tended to be. At the base of the stairs was the area where the professor himself stood, donning the same black cloak with leather gloves such that only the skin on his face was visible. Pale complexion matched against dark hair. He turned, when addressed, and folded his hands behind his back as he looked at Ellesandra, as if trying to recall if he'd seen her face before. "Hm? How can I help you, miss?" His eyes narrowed a little. "Not a face I recognize, so I suppose you're not here with follow up questions on how one properly enchants iron to prepare it to seat and contain empowered gemstones, mn?" A smile upon his face answered his own question. Of course that wasn't why they were here. He patiently waited for the answer from the knight.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was doubly on guard while all of the students came out, but as the Professor addressed her, and confirmed that she wasn't a student, Ellesandra shook her head. "No Sir." She had gone into her more professional, respectful demeanor. A low nod of her head was given to him in respect before she spoke. "My companion is looking to find a way to open a portal to a realm that has a strong magical cipher. Miss Amelia here is helping us out, but she suggested that you may be able to provide the best and quickest assistance in cracking this cipher." Ellesandra certainly got straight to the point after the polite hello. She slipped her fingers into her leggings, and pulled out the tarot card. "I was also advised that you were particularly interested in powerful magical artifacts, and might be willing to lend us your time in such if we were willing to let you examine a unique, powerful artifact. If you aren't already busy?" Ellesandra certainly wasn't an expert negotiator. She wasn't great with people, she was straight to the point and offered what they had in exchange for what they wanted. She was a straight shooter, so in hindsight maybe Amelia or Star should have taken the lead in this.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The professor, Akarus being his given name that had yet to be given, kept his respectful posture as he was addressed. A brow rose at the mention of powerful magical artifacts. He then looked at Amelia, who was bowing her head in reverence. All the information was taken in and processed, and all the while the man maintained a charming smile. He certainly seemed pleasant. Trustworthy, at a glance. Perhaps a little...Silver-tongued; his smile had a roguish tint to it that was hard to discern if it was just playfully amused or something else. But if there was anything worthy of distrust, Star wasn't speaking up about it. "Artifice, hence, artifacts, are in fact my specialty," he began. "Miss...Amelia, of the First Crusaders, has good cause to suspect as she does, and all the reason to be aware of my exploits given it is the mission of her sect of the Followers of Myst to acquire the very artifacts that Myst keeps in its collections, and thusly has persons like me seek to understand and...When possible, replicate. My home plane of Aetheria has similar magics that ward it, so I am familiar," he explained, then looked back at the card. "What is it you have for me here? There are certainly things I could busy myself with but...If you have something of particular uniqueness, it does shove all that busywork down the priorities table, doesn't it?" he said, not reaching for the card, but asking Ellesandra to explain, or perhaps hand it to him if she was so inclined to have him figure things out himself. "You might also tell me what plane it is you speak of. Why, there is a non-zero chance I already know how to get there, being something of a planar vagabond at times myself in search of things strange, unique, and mysterious."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took in a deep breath when he confirmed he had things to do that could be 'pushed back for something interesting'. Part of her disliked this answer, but she wasn't going to show that. The distaste was ignored as she turned the Tarot card so that he could see it, albeit from a bit away. "A woman named Freya, from a Spire, gave me this card. Only I am able to see the change in it, in how the split down the middle moves based on my internal struggle. And from what she told me, it would provide some form of power or boon once once side has fully taken up the card. Upon receiving it, I had my companion Miss Star Lumina here look at it and she confirmed there was powerful magic in it, but it wasn't of any danger to us." She briefly glanced over to Amelia, then back to the Professor. "Miss Amelia has implied that this power is much more than we realized, enough to do....a lot, once it is unlocked and accessible. She also implied it might be related to something called the Lost Spire, and a trial of sorts for it." That was probably enough to catch his attention, right? She still held onto the card, careful that he couldn't just reach out and snap it from her. "As for our destination, it is the plane Gurhal. Star can give you more information on a more specific location within the plane, if that is needed."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Akarus kept his hands folded politely behind his back. He listened closely to what they had to say, eyes occasionally flicking to Amelia, then to Star, as attention was drawn to each. The words 'Lost Spire' brought up some interest in his eyes. "Ah, the Lost Spire, is it? It's been a few years since I'd delved into that little...Pocket of mystery. There was another guild here in Myst for a while you know. Seekers of the Spire they called themselves, led by one Luna Everflame. She went in search of this place but...It's been oh...Two years or so since anyone's heard from her? Something like that? The guild all but fell apart in her absence, but it is all to say that particular mystery is one that has caught the attention of many here in Myst over the years. Plenty of materials to pour over in the archives, should your curiosity lead you to them. But it sounds like...You have your own little slice of the Spire here, in the form of this card, yes?" he said, still keeping his posture polite and respectful, not making motion to try and take it from her in the slightest. "You might have people who were interested to hear about this...Freya woman. So they might try and seek her, vain as that attempt might be for someone with such powers as she. Curious that you were given a card that has powers, however...The understanding I've come to is that while there is, in some way, and involvement of such cards in the trials of the Spire, they are said only to have power within that realm. Perhaps this Freya is able to circumvent those rules a little.." he mused aloud. "But I trust Miss. Wysperwick's assessment of it," he said, looking to Amelia. They hadn't given their surname before, but there it was. "The question I have, then...Is what do you intend on doing with the power, once it's unlocked?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She was feeling a little uncomfortable with how calm this man was in this information, compared to how Amelia had reacted to it. The reveal of Amelia's surname did cause Ellesandra to glance towards the woman, but it was only briefly. Her discomfort led to her, now that the card had been shown, lowering it back down to slip into her pocket. Just a little bit safer than it just being held out overall. "I'm afraid I'm not comfortable sharing information about Freya. I have no desire to have her dealing with people seeking her out in hopes of fortune or power." She said, then shook her head. The power question was conflicting. Part of her wanted to say she could resurrect Marigold, but she didn't. Not only did they not know how the power would manifest, but Ellesandra also wasn't really sure if that was the right use of it. Would Marigold want to be resurrected, this long after her death, so far away from her homeland? No matter how much Ellesandra would like her to still be alive, it didn't change that she HAD died. And unless the card could change time itself, simply resurrecting her wouldn't fix that. "I don't particularly want power, Sir. I'd rather this type of thing not be complicating mine and Star's mission, plus we are unable to identify in what form the power will show itself, so I can't honestly tell you what I would do with it if I ever do get it." She paused, then added. "I have no goals of goddesshood or ruling anyone. At most, I would use the power to better protect my charge, as is my duty, and ensure we are able to find her mother like we are set out to look for."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Akarus gave a bit of a pause. Something Ellesandra had said seemed to resonate with him. Though Ellesandra might not see it, Star's face softened, and a bit of sorrow came over her. "...Lost her mother, has she?" said Akarus, a bit more somber than before, still maintaining his professional air about him. He then turned to his desk, plucked the quill that was resting in the inkwell upon it, and grabbed some spare parchment that was also laid on his desk. He was busy with this for a time, writing what appeared to be a particularly complex series of...Something or other upon it. He then raised his free, gloved hand and flicked his wrist down at the parchment, which had a small tuff of flame hit the page and rather immediately dry the inks. He then folded the parchment and held it out towards Amelia. "Miss. Wysperwick, please do see that you aide these two in attuning one of the gates of Myst to Gurhal. You'll find the sigil sequence upon this parchment. Do commit it to memory, and destroy the parchment when you have done so." An ominous set of instructions, which also revealed that this man knew the way to Star's home from the onset of their conversation. He didn't look interested in talking further, however, even if it was about this card of such immense power he had been so interested in moments before. "If that is quite all, I have teaching obligations to fulfil."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She didn't speak or add anything, since it didn't seem like he was needing any other information. She considered correcting him in that Star hadn't lost her mother, only that they'd been separated and were on a rescue mission, essentially. Then again, making that clarification didn't seem to be necessary. So, she stood there awkwardly as he wrote something on paper, not wanting to interrupt and glancing towards Amelia while he did so. She wasn't sure if this was normal or not. The confirmation that he was giving Amelia the sigil sequence, though, sent a brief shock of excitement through Ellesandra. That was much easier than she'd been expecting, that they just got whatever sigils would be needed then? The fact he didn't ask to look at the card any more confused her, since she'd understood he might want to study it from Amelia. Still, she wouldn't complain. When he politely dismissed them, she lowered her head to him. "Thank you, Professor." She would glance again to Amelia to follow her lead on how they were going to leave or if they needed to say or do anything else before doing so. And her hand reached out, squeezing Star's arm again. Progress.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Akarus gave a curt, professional nod at the thanks. He understood what was meant, 'lost' as in separated. It evoked the response all the same; a correction would have just been met with clarification that he didn't need a correction. Amelia, meanwhile, had to take a second before accepting the parchment. She looked...Very confused. Beyond confused. It didn't take an auramancer to see, nor did it take a genius to put together that whatever just happened there was not even close to normal. Star had looked a little sorrowful when Ellesandra grabbed her arm, but she looked at them and smiled all the same. It was a sad smile. She saw something sad. But they had made progress indeed. Once they had left the lecture hall again, Star had a moment of contemplation, looking around them. "...I suppose it'll be our last night here in Myst, then," she said, a little sad about that fact. They could come back, but...Would they? It remained to be seen. It had felt nice, sleeping in a warm bed, in a safe place. A break from the constant fighting to survive. The time had passed to sunset with all their travels, so evening meals and preparations were on the agenda. Amelia was left in some measure of stunned silence, but also had buried her face in the sigil sequence provided, hurriedly trying to do as asked and follow orders from the professor. She still led them around, and had presence of mind to watch so as to not bump into anyone else, but still was clearly occupied as they set their sights on getting back to the guild hall for the evening.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Well, that was odd. She watched Amelia's obvious confusion and surprise at how things turned out, but followed out and began heading back to the guild hall while Amelia buried her face in the notes. She knew better than to try to disturb a magic nerd who was mid-study in something they were interested or focused on, so she instead turned her attention to Star. "If we are to leave tomorrow, then yes. Is there anything you would like to do before we go?" She offered this, not knowing if she could really follow through with it. That was the painful thing about being reliant on Amara and Amelia to get them back into the guild hall, if they decided to go out and do something. Amelia especially looked like she might be busy with the notes for a little bit. Still, if there was something Star would like to do, she would offer it and see how she could make it work. The caged feelings burned, even as her denial reasoned that she wanted to do make sure Star had a good last evening in Myst because it was her duty as a guard to ensure the safety, and happiness, of her charge. It was an excuse that told herself on the conscious level, but in reality, that cage around her feelings just...wasn't really caging well.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wasn't sure how to respond to the question. On the one hand, there were a trillion things she wanted to do in Myst. There didn't seem to be an excess of touristy things to do, sights to see beyond the athenaeum itself, but there was something magical - literally - about this floating cloud city in its own pocket of the multiverse. She thought about the question. They had gone out and had fun shopping for clothes, which was in itself something Star found wholly enjoyable, and the pleasant memories of how Ellesandra had looked at her in her new magical outfit were still in her mind. She envisioned herself doing something, anything in Myst, and the reality of it all was just...No matter what it was, her vision of it didn't see her doing it alone. It was, all of it, done together, with Ellesandra at her side. Smiling in her vision, even if she knew the knight to be wholly stoic more often than not. So when she found the answer within herself and turned her head to look again at Ellesandra, her answer was as honest, and earnest as she always was, though it was said quietly enough so as to not be distracting to Amelia and their sensitive, fluffy ears: "I want to be with you. That's all."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was taken a little aback by the request. On the one hand it sent butterflies swarming her stomach. She wanted to say yes, a little part of her wanted to take Star out on a nice fancy date. That part did not win, though. What won was Ellesandra making a noncommittal grunt and looking around. "That doesn't really give us a location to go, Star." She considered. Her heart was beating faster for absolutely no apparent reason right now. When she thought of what to do, she just kept thinking about the side by side, touching in some way. Eventually, she forced these thoughts out and brought up a task oriented focus. "Why don't we get some hot cocoa, find a nice cozy place to sit and discuss tactics together? And - and I know you want to talk about more than that." That's what the cocoa would be for, but she felt like that could remain unsaid. "And maybe look at stars, like we did that night on the tavern roof?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star just gave a soft, amused smile. That was the point, you absolute goofball. It didn't matter where they went...So long as they were together. She didn't say these things of course. But it was enough for her to feel them in her heart. Then, hearing that they wanted to get cocoa and look at the stars? That had her blushing. She gently nodded. "M-Mmnh. I think that sounds nice." Of course, this did rely on them having some way back into the guild hall, didn't it? Somehow it got a lot less romantic if they had to have Amelia tag along. And a LOT less romantic for Star if Amara was tagging along. She looked at Ellesandra, a little uncertain on that matter, assuming they had...Thought that part through and had something in mind for it.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Getting confirmation, Ellesandra looked up to Amelia, who was both leading them and studying. "Sorry to interrupt, Miss Wysperwick. Do you know if there are any patios or balconies or anything in the guild hall in which we can see the stars from? Helps us think and relax for the tactical conversation and making plans for the upcoming days." This was...true, but it wasn't the real reason Ellesandra has suggested doing so. Star seemed to enjoy it, and Ellesandra was a little tired of just being cooped up in their bedroom for such conversations. If it was a little public that would be okay, as long as they had some semblance of privacy. And for a place as fancy as the Guild Hall, she felt like there had to be some sort of option for that; or she hoped so anyways.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia blinked as she was addressed. She gave a slightly flat look at Ellesandra. "Please call me Amelia. Just Amelia. No miss. Unless you're just trying to make me feel old," she said with her usual attitude alive and well. Not snippy, still friendly, but that selfsame sarcasm was present. "But yeah, if you wanna go on a date there's an open air seating space in the rear of the guild hall that doesn't see a lot of people moving through it," she said, having an unusually swift delivery of the fact, as if it made her...Uncomfortable to talk about. Touching a nerve, maybe? She looked quick to jump back into the parchment in front of her, revising over the sigil sequence again and again and again and again and again until it was burned into her memory. Star looked...Not uncomfortable, but a bit nervous all the same from the response.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was about to call Amelia miss again, just to tease her now that the attitude was back. She'd stopped in her tracks when Amelia referenced it as a date though. Her lips pursed and she looked displeased, but her heart was suddenly pounding harder and the damn butterflies were back again. She looked over at Star, who just seemed nervous at that, then back to Amelia. Should she correct Amelia? The part of her in denial wanted to, wanted to say loudly that it wasn't a date and they weren't dating. Then she remembered the feeling of Stars heart in her own chest, how upset and hurt Star had been at her rejection. So instead, she looked at Star. She lowered her voice, making it gentle. "This isn't a date." The words came out, but they very much conflicted with the nerves and anxiety in Ellesandras own body. Not to mention, there was now concern that she'd upset Star and cause another blow up, leading to them needing to delay longer. But even through that there was a spark of...excitement. Ellesandra hadn't been on a 'date' in a long time, even if this totally was not one at all whatsoever nu uh.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star blinked, then raised her hands defensively. Why was Ellesandra saying that to her? She didn't call it at date! A nervous expression came over her again, but ultimately she didn't seem offended or rejected. She saw it more just as Ellesandra getting in front of Amelia's brash declaration...One that had Star's own heart thumping in her chest. She understood it wasn't a date, so the pointed correction, while not painful, still was like a cold bucket of water over her excitement. "Uh huh, I sure do bring all my platonic super totally just friends and nothing else out for cocoa and romantic star-gazing, at least once a week in fact," said Amelia, and once Ellesandra looked back at her she made sure to flick the furry ears atop her head to make a point that she had keen hearing. Strange that Amelia had such a keen interest on Ellesandra and Star's relationship, but maybe it was just her attitude showing itself some more.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had said that to Star to set expectations. She didn't want Star getting her hopes up, then hurt. That was the goal of saying it anyways, but when Amelia poked at the faulty logic in what Ellesandra said there was...probably an unexpected reaction. There was a familiar, remembered pain. It was tied to and around the grief, but it itself wasn't the grief of losing Marigold. It was the acceptance Ellesandra finally had that her and Marigold would never be an item, no matter how much Ellesandra had wanted it. There was a beat of silence where Ellesandra wrestled irritation at Amelia down, along with the memory of that pain. And then she responded, maybe just a little more acidly than was necessary. "Thank you, Miss Amelia, for your obviously practiced and experienced opinion." The words were harsher than she'd actually meant them to be, and she knew it immediately. There was a pang of regret, but Ellesandra just turned her head and took a deep breath in. She didn't apologize, but did add - "Cocoa helps me think and process, and Star enjoys celestial watching." It was the explanation for why she'd suggested it. Even if it did have romantic undertones, her denial at least had this to hold onto. And she knew wading into this too much would only lead to her accidentally saying something that would upset Star, so she cleared her throat. "Should we pick up any supplies now, before we leave tomorrow Star? I guess it depends on where the portal opens up to?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia, being that she had such an attitude, was fairly used to people snapping at her. It didn't faze her. She just smirked and rolled her eyes. She considered firing back, but there was a flicker of...Something. Anger? Pain? Something that she kept below the surface. Though it didn't stop Star from noticing. Star looked visibly uncomfortable now as she listened to Ellesandra's words to follow. Star gave a little shake of her head. "I can't think of anything specific," she said, meek and quiet. The tension between those two clearly was not doing well for her emotional state for some reason. Amelia interjected again, though it was to be actually helpful this time: "The portals are all sitting on the end of the arms that stretch out beyond city limits. Some people call them the clock hands, since there are twelve and they are equidistant. Just like the portal we walked in on. Any of those twelve exits will do. I'll be attuning the portal. Though if you're intent on leaving tomorrow, I'd suggest figuring out whether you are going alone, or if you are going to talk to the captain about seeing if there are plans to bring us along," she said, resisting the urge to add a snippy 'if you feel like you can tolerate me that is'.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandras regret at snapping at Amelia was only intensified at how meek Star seemed to get. There was still pain in what Amelia had said, but that hadn't been her fault - she'd had no way of knowing that would trigger memories. She reached out to Star, hand taking hers just long enough to squeeze it reassuringly before she released it. "I meant more where the portal leads us to, such as if we get dumped into the middle of a wilderness or if we can get close to a town or city." She clarified this, unsure if she was misunderstanding something or if Amelia had misinterpreted her previous statement as where they enter the portal, not where they came out. In all honesty she assumed she herself was in the wrong; Amelia was certainly more intelligent than her and she had no issue admitting that. "And as long as Star is okay with it, considering this is her home plane, I think having you two join would be ideal." She looked at Star, thinking about what she'd mentioned about them having died to the armor if the other two weren't there. It was probably true.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was happy to have the reassuring squeeze. She smiled. She took Ellesandra's hand with both her hands while they walked, just for a moment, to try and show her own support for Ellesandra in turn. She could see them hurting. She was there for them, she didn't want them to forget it. "That part should be controllable. If Star knows a place, that makes it easier. Portals tend to work best when you either have something from the plane, or knowledge of a specific place. Granted, local magic can be problematic. Appearing in the middle of some farming settlement is usually no big deal - at least, not accounting for how you'd freak out the locals - as there's unlikely to be any wards. Teleporting into a big city usually requires you know the destination of a circle to anchor yourself to. Any big magical city, like Waterdeep for example, will have things to prevent people from just...Appearing in the middle of their city without warning. Not perfect but...Generally speaking you want to aim for wilderness that is somewhat close to where you're going. There's variance and inaccuracies to consider, but Myst portals are generally accurate to within a kilometer, and have intelligent magical fortification in their magical structure that allows them to scry the destination for things like, oh, giant cliffs and canyons and lakes of lava and other things you might not want to step out into," explained Amelia, finally folding the parchment up again and closing her eyes, trying to repeat it from memory. "I'll make sure it's somewhere safe, and near whatever civilized place is the first stop." She didn't quite assume she was going to be included just yet, nearly having said 'our'. Star then gave a bit of an amused look at Ellesandra. "I might be from Gurhal, but it's not like I own it or have any say who comes or goes," she said with a giggle. "And of course I'm okay with it. I'd love to have you and Amara come with us, Amelia," said Star, earnest and sweet as ever. This had a similar effect to the last time she had addressed Amelia this way. A flush of red on the cheeks, a shy look away, as if the notion of being accepted so wholeheartedly was something the fox-eared woman struggled with.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She accepted the small comfort of Star squeezing her hand too, for a moment. In the back of her mind there was an idea that she should try to process that, and that maybe Star could help. But it was pushed down for now; that was certainly not something she wanted to do with Amelia, or anyone else around anyways. Ellesandra nodded at all of this technical knowledge on how portals worked. Normally she would have been bored at this, but this information was actually useful and important for her job. She needed to know what to expect when going through, so as to best be able to protect Star after all. When Star mentioned not owning Gurhal, she shook her head. "No I meant -" What did she mean? She was just trying to be mindful of Star's privacy, with her home and this mission, if she wanted to keep it that way. Despite Star very consistently showing that she didn't care for or need the privacy that Ellesandra always did, she still erred on the side of giving it. "Nevermind. I agree, Miss Amelia." This time when she said it, there was none of the snark acid. It was teasing, to poke fun at her and give her back exactly what she tried to give to them consistently. A companionable teasing, more like. "Should we swing by somewhere to chat with the Captain before we settle in for the evening activities, first? I don't want to assume she's available for it and/or willing. You should know that there are some potentially powerful enemies who we will certainly have to go through to find Star's mother."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Really? Powerful enemies? Do let me know when they show up, because last time I just figured I'd summon Vaerix for the fun of it," said Amelia with no shortage of expected sarcasm that was firing back for their insistence on using 'miss'. She gave a playful look at Ellesandra. "I don't keep a bell on the captain, though, so if you wanna chat, we can swing by her room, see if she's there." The group arrived at the portal chamber, then, and Amelia opened the portal to the guild hall. It seemed that Ellesandra did want to speak to Amara, so unless there was an objection along the way, Amelia led the group along the halls that had row upon row of logically sorted groupings of rooms, which, as Amelia had promised to Ellesandra on a previous night, eventually featured the 'FC' series of rooms. FC1 was naturally the first, and had distinction upon it by way of an etched plaque nailed into the door that read 'Captain of the First Crusaders' with another below it bearing the name 'Amara Sunsong'. Hard to miss. Amelia rapped on the door a few times. Not long after, Amara came to the door in plain clothes. Amelia then gave a wide gesture towards the captain as she stepped aside, looking at Ellesandra to talk about whatever they wanted to talk about. Naturally, Amara was smiling, and welcomed the group into her room by standing aside. The room, while much larger than the guest rooms and sporting finer craftsmanship and materials, was surprisingly...Plain. No real personal effects could be seen, as one might expect of a permanent residence. Perhaps this wasn't where Amara preferred to live? Or perhaps there was some other reason it looked as sparse as a guest room.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra pictured Amara with a bell. A smirk came over her face and she looked at Amelia pointedly. "Why not? Not into that?" It had become apparent, at least she thought so, that Amara and Amelia weren't actually a couple like Ellesandra had first assumed. But if Amelia wanted to create a sassy, teasing relationship between them - Ellesandra could return. Now that she felt...kind of comfortable with the woman, anyways. Her guard was still up; she wasn't about to share personal information with Amelia, but a companionable teasing back and forth was perfectly comfortable for her. And based on the look she'd gotten previously when almost mentioning dominating women in her bed, Amelia at the very least wouldn't be too surprised by such teasing. Star, on the other hand, Ellesandra was a little uncertain of. After making the comment she glanced over at Star, a gauge to see if Star understood it, or it made her uncomfortable. There was caution there, wanting to ensure that she didn't make her companion uncomfortable with that type of joke. Either way though, she'd follow Amelia to Amara's room, eyeing the door with her name for a moment and taking a second to remember how to get here, if she needed to in the future. When Amara opened the door and waved them in, Ellesandra would allow Star in first before following up behind. She had to resist the urge to salute Amara, not only because her salute probably wasn't the same as Amara's company or that she was out of work gear, but because she felt like that would create an odd statement to start this off. She did a cursory glance around the room, mostly for danger, and didn't really find the lack of decoration concerning or odd at all. "Captain. We found what we're looking for, thanks to Miss Whippersnapper here." The intentional change of Amelia's last name was said without even looking in Amelia's direction, a completely stoic look on her face. "We were planning to set out tomorrow. I know there was interest in having people from here go to Gurhal to gather some information and details on the plain, and Amelia expressed interest in joining us on our journey to find Star's mother. Would you be interested in joining?" As with Professor Yami, Ellesandra got straight to the point. She really wasn't a negotiator, she was a straight shooter business type person. No need to beat around the bush.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

In order for Star to become uncomfortable with the joke, it would require she understand what the implication was. But the reality was shown by her response, which was a mumble mostly to herself: "Bells? Maybe...Fashionable?" she thought, once more exposing just how deep her innocence on the matter ran. Should the day ever come that Ellesandra met Star's previous guardian, Nina, the utter shock at how Star managed to retain her innocence around that woman might be enough to give Ellesandra whiplash. "Very creative, grandma, never heard that one before," said Amelia without a moment of hesitation. Amara wore a little smirk. "I see you two are getting along nicely," commented the captain, amused. "Seems you've been busy, then," she added as she closed the door behind the group, gesturing for Star and Ellesandra to have a seat on the couch in the living area. Not something Amelia needed, as the magi was already helping herself to lay herself out on the adjacent two-seater. Amara had a single chair, facing the couch, with a circular table in the middle. A fairly standard arrangement. "Whether I and Amelia go is less up to us and more up to the guild administration, but in this case that's more of a formality," said Amara with a smile. "Truth is, whether you want us to go to Gurhal or not, that is where we're going. There's knowledge to be gained, and possible artifacts to recover. It is in the interest of Myst that any magical artifacts we discover in our time there be secured and returned here for safe keeping and study," she said, which quietly implied that she and Amelia had first 'dibs' on anything notable. "I'd normally be bringing more of my team with me for this, however. At the very least, I'd prefer to have Rinnie, Maeva, and Kaspar. But you've caught us at a time where the rest of the crusaders are on other assignment. So, with that in mind, it'd fall to you both to fill in the needed combat roles to make for a successful expedition. Something that I think more than merits a fair share of spoils along the way," she said, donning another soft smile. Professional speak that asked Ellesandra to read between the lines. Bending the rules a little, it seemed. "If the terms are acceptable, then Amelia and I would be happy to join you two."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had to resist the urge to just reach out and ruffle Star's hair at her innocence and confusion. The grandma comment had her tilting her head and bringing a finger up to lightly bounce her silver haired ponytail. "Original." The dry sarcasm was sent right back at Amelia, but then her focus was entirely on Amara as she went through the specifics on them joining Star and Ellesandra. Ellesandra had begun frowning, looking over to Star, then back to them. "You're talking about going to a place that you have no purview over, gathering magical artifacts that belong to that location and realm, and bringing them back here. Without permission from said realm? And...if that is your mission, will it detract from our own?" Another glance at Star. "I don't know how much time we want to go off on side things before focusing on our own goal here." It was entirely possible Ellesandra had just...interpreted what Amara had said in the worst light. But when Amara said they went to other plains to 'gather information' that had been one thing. It was important to learn of various cultures and stuff right? Or some wise scholar probably said so at some point in time. But specifically seeking out magical artifacts within said plane and bringing them back to Myst felt like they were closer to thieves than they were explorers or scholars. It was one thing if the artifact was particularly dangerous or evil, and it needed to be guarded or protected, but for the average thing it didn't sit right with Ellesandra. Then again, she didn't know the whole story, and she hired herself out to guard for missions like this within her own realm before. Oh, she'd ensured it was an artifact that no one currently owned; she wouldn't hire herself out as a thief's hitwoman, but if they happened to stumble upon something in a cave she looked the other way. There was just a bit of surprise, having expected something different from the Captain, was all.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amara chuckled. "It's not as though the realm itself has any way for me to talk to it and make sure it's fine with us taking the item in question. Now, if the artifact already has a clear owner, or it comes to our understanding that someone has ownership of it, well. That's a different story, and bids for fair trade come into play. But many artifacts end up lost, without owner for whatever reason. And it is the mission of the First Crusaders to secure these things such that they do not fall into the wrong hands. While it might be romantic to envision the Book of Exalted Deeds falls neatly into the lap of someone who will go on to do, well...Exalted deeds, it just as easily could wind up in the hands of someone who seeks to throw it into the river Styx, banishing its goodness for generations to come. Matters little for common magic, but some say Myst was created as a vision for what could be, if magic was properly structured with law and guiding philosophy of doing the greatest good, while allowing the least harm. Hardly perfect, but...That's the goal. As for whether our mission will detract from yours, well. Anything important enough to warrant a full investigation and retrieval would also be something I wouldn't attempt to do with just myself and Amelia. So as for how things stand now, the intent is just to scout the realm, while eliciting the helpful guidance of a local," she s aid, smiling at Star. Star had a fairly neutral expression, but did smile at Amara. There was a lot to consider. "Speaking practically about it, I would say the most likely distraction from the goal would be a couple of hours, maybe an overnight stay in a location to secure something of value before moving on. I understand that that isn't nothing, so if it results in us parting ways, there wouldn't be any hard feelings. Could always let you two go on ahead while we catch up, or something. There's too many variables to say how things would shake out, and it's not worth speculating. But at least initially, I imagine having the four of us together will set us off on the best foot, as opposed to each of us going our own way. I'd rather not just speak as though I'm calling the shots here, though. You tell me what's important to you, and what you need from us, to see if we can come to something mutual."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

That idea still didn't feel entirely right to Ellesandra, but Amara did have a point. Sometimes having a powerful magical artifact just laying around somewhere might be more of a detriment to people around it than having someone come in, find it and bring it back. She listened to the rest of how things would be outlined, before looking over to Star. Really, this was her decision, not Ellesandra's. "I see no harm in that. And we can make a decision at the time if we need to split off for a bit, but I know you were seeking ways to make money anyways and it's entirely possible both of those could align. If some magical artifact happened to be causing undead to spill out of graveyards or something." She was intentionally choosing a positive reason to take an artifact - one that she knew Star would agree to help with and honestly, she would too. Star would see that there was trepidation within Ellesandra, but it wasn't that it was paranoia. It was caution, and though she relatively trusted Amara to have their back if something happened - she'd proven that based on their fight with the magical armor - she hardly knew the captain. Caution felt necessary, but there was no reason not to agree to go along together at least for a ways.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amara gave a soft smile. "Certainly something we'd want to get involved in," said Amara in agreement. Truly they were not vagrant thieves taking anything magical that wasn't nailed down, but it was still easy to see how their work could be viewed as disruptive to what might be 'natural' or 'fated' for those that ascribed to such notions. Star looked back at Ellesandra. She couldn't really say it aloud, but she did wish that the decision was more mutual than left on her shoulders. She erred on the side of trust, Ellesandra on the side of caution. She felt that the best decision was often somewhere in between, and preferred to not drag Ellesandra along. Such things to add to the pile of things to talk about. For now, Ellesandra seemed to outline it well. Star nodded. "We'll all be safer traveling together. There are dangerous places in Gurhal. Plenty of safe places, of course, but...There's a lot of things in Gurhal that, from my travels elsewhere, I can come to realize were not at all typical. Like these things we call nar lillies - sentient flowers that will expel poison on you from their beaks." A flower with a beak in itself sounded...strange. The example evoked some raised brows. "Things you wouldn't expect. I'm sure things even I don't know about, so...We'll be safest together," said Star, nodding once more. She seemed set, concluded that this was the best path forward. And if they had to separate, they could figure that out in the moment.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had been trying to share the decision by giving her input. Sure she put the final decision on Star, but in her mind her opinion had been given and Star could decide anything in between. A compromise of going together, but with the option to split off if needed later was perfect. She nodded, then turned back to look at Amara with a smile. "So, Captain, I think what she is saying is we shouldn't stop to smell the roses. A flower shooting poison at you sounds like a very unsavory experience. An interesting gift from a spurned ex though." Ellesandra was attempting to let humor lighten the tension she personally felt with what Amara had said regarding their goals. She was going to give Amara and Amelia - and the rest of Myst - the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. Didn't mean she wouldn't be cautious, even more so with magical items like her card, but the two had done nothing but show them kindness so far. "Is there anything on our end that needs to be done to get the red tape with the guild completed? Or additionally needed to be done prior to setting out tomorrow?" Best to know now and plan how to address than to wait until tomorrow just before setting out to panic do something last minute.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star seemed to enjoy the result. She then giggled. "Well. They are also like five feet tall, so not really a romantic flower you can slip into a bouquet. They can also just, you know, bite you. There's also a rare cousin of them that..." she gently shook her head. "I think we'll just try to avoid them if we see them. I might be immune to poison, but I assume I'm alone there." With the topic moving to red tape, she set about sitting politely and quietly again. Amara shook her head. "You two don't need to do anything. I'll handle everything on my end in the morning for me and Amelia. Just a matter of informing of our intent. In an absolute emergency, we may be recalled to Myst but...We'll cross that bridge if it comes to it."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra considered making a joking comment about being prepared for them to abandon Star and her, but decided that her relationship with Amara wasn't yet at a point where that type of joking comment could be made easily. Instead, she nodded. The information about Star being immune to poison was new, and she tucked that away as something to ask about during their tactics conversation. Well, maybe it wasn't new - the book had said she couldn't get sick or diseased or anything in a normal way, and poison was kind of along that vein, but Ellesandra hadn't connected the dots fully. With that confirmation, she'd glance over to Amelia - who had been pretty silent since the first bit, and then back to Amara. "Well, if nothing else is needed then, Star and I were going to talk more tactics in case we were to get into another fight again. I can't always rely on you to distract an enemy when I take a blow like I did last time." She would take a step back towards the door, but looked back towards Amara and Amelia, just to confirm there was nothing else they needed to add. "We'll meet you for breakfast tomorrow around dawn? Or is that too early?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was something in the way Amara was looking at Ellesandra that suggested they had more to say, but was keeping it to themselves. Star seemed briefly uncomfortable and avoided looking at Amara. Amelia was flicking between looking at the parchment she had and folding it to close her eyes. "Sounds like a plan, Ellesandra," said Amara. "Dawn it is. I'll ensure everything is wrapped up this evening, then." Professional and polite. "That means you should head to bed early as well, Amelia," said Amara, evoking a groan from Amelia. "Yeah, yeah, kicking me out, I see how it is," said Amelia in turn, rolling off her place to stand. She moved out of the room and set off to her room unless there was more business for her. Amara moved to the door to see them off. If there were no closing remarks, she wished the pair good night. Star smiled at Amara, though was left with a lingering, difficult expression as the were to set off. Amelia called out before disappearing into her room: "Just follow the hall we were walking along to the end and hang a right to get to your date, you two." And the door closed before Ellesandra could quip back, of course.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra saw the look in Amara's eyes. She frowned, scrunching her eyebrows together. Unlike Star, she wasn't able to tell there was interest there. In reality, she'd been bad at telling someone was interested in her forever; she was cautious about people and always just assumed interest in her was friendly, at best. So she wasn't sure what was going on there, and as they headed out of Amara's room, she had stayed in there rather than walking off. She'd rolled her eyes at Amelia's comment, feeling...anger at her for pointing out what it kind of was, even against Ellesandra's denial. Denial didn't work well when someone was throwing it back in your face that it was what you were denying it was. There were the same conflicted emotions as before at the prospect of this being a date, but Amelia hadn't given her time to respond anyways. She just clenched her jaw and shook her head, before looking over to Amara. "You had something else to say. Is all okay?" Ellesandra's ignorant ass thought Amara had something else of concern in regards to the mission or their joining together, not interest in Ellesandra herself. She was also unfortunately not picking up the odd behavior from and expression on Star's face regarding the woman. Eventually she'd learn to watch Star closer in regards to how she was responding to other's emotions, but for right now she was still feeling uncomfortable at the idea of Star being able to see that in others - and her potentially gaining any insight into them from Star's ability to do that.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a lot that went unsaid, a lot that went unknown under the otherwise scrutinizing eyes of the knight. A flick of Amara's eyes at Star, the flick of her ear upon hearing Amelia call it all a date, then her eyes refocused on Ellesandra. She donned a warm smile, as the interest that was there was snuffed out by the notion that it was...Not worth the complication. Truly, it had only been physical attraction. Amara didn't know Ellesandra well enough for there to be anything beyond that. And knowing there might be something between Ellesandra and Star like that, well. She was a polite woman who knew when to back off. She gently shook her head. "Don't worry about it, Ellesandra. It doesn't matter any longer, and all is well. Forget I ever asked," she said, donning a warm smile before excusing herself back into her room to close the door on the others, unless Ellesandra had more to say of course.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra paused, blinking. And then after Amara closed the door, she turned to look at Star with an expression of befuddlement. "She...didn't ask anything though?" Ellesandra racked her brain to remember if Amara had asked a question during that conversation that had gone unanswered. She didn't think so, and she shook her head, beginning to walk down the hallway in the direction Amelia had indicated while looking back towards Star. "I didn't unintentionally offend her or something, did I?" She knew that she could come off as brash or cold sometimes, with being so straight to the point, and the fact that she'd called out that it sounded like thievery only now occurred to Ellesandra as an insult or offensive.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile at Ellesandra as she walked alongside them. She obviously knew the answer. All the answers. But.. "I don't know how to answer that.." she said softly, clearly fighting with herself on the matter. On the one hand she wanted to assure Ellesandra it was nothing of the sort, but ever since seeing how uncomfortable it had made Ellesandra in the past to step over the line, she had overcorrected to not sharing anything, even if it was something one might be able to be reasonably certain of with just examining someone else's expressions. There was no way for Star to say 'I don't THINK she was offended'. There was only what she knew. It wasn't speculation, for her. "Also uhm...Didn't you want to get some cocoa before we went over there?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

That comment brought Ellesandra up short. She looked at Star, realizing that she clearly knew what had caused Amara's response. Yet she was respecting Ellesandra's wish that she not share things that she learned based on seeing their aura. A moment passed with Ellesandra watching her, unsure how to feel about that, but then...She smiled. Her heart skipped a beat and there was part of her that felt touched, and grateful that Star was withholding that. Star had truly taken her concerns to heart previously, in how she'd done that with Amelia, and changed the behavior here. After a moment of watching her, she nodded at the reminder for cocoa. "You're right, sorry." There weren't more words given in regards to the Amara situation, but she did reach out and take Star's elbow to squeeze for a moment. A silent thanks. In a way, it helped anyways. She knew Star had seen whatever was going on for Amara, and it obviously hadn't frightened or upset her. So, it couldn't be anything too bad. The squeeze to her elbow was brief before she began back down the hallway towards the main guild hall, where they could order a couple mugs of cocoa. "Would you like any food to go with that, Star?" She'd ask before they got there. It had been a long day and they hadn't eaten since breakfast after all, would be a nice dinner. Definitely not a date. Definitely not a date.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had never met anyone like Ellesandra before. Someone so intensely private. She herself was so open that, while there was a great deal of guidance from her mother on how to be respectful with her gift, sometimes those good intentions didn't work out so well. But her awareness of and comfort with emotion did, at least, allow her to overcome emotional barriers, rigid pride, or other things that made people slow to change, with relative ease. She was human, just like Ellesandra. Fallible. But over the time she had known Ellesandra, she had learned things piece by piece, and among them knew how much more action meant than words to the knight. So when Ellesandra smiled, she smiled back. She wasn't proving a point; she would have done just the same regardless, but she was glad that Ellesandra saw the change. She was glad her respect for her companion was showing. Back to the main guild hall, she considered the offer of food. "I don't know that I want anything right now...Cocoa and conversation doesn't feel quite the same if I have a salad leaf poking out of my chubby cheeks," she said with a giggle, focused more on connecting with her companion than her body's needs. "But if you're hungry, well, we could add dinner to the mix. I don't mind either way."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra made it to the guild hall, though was looking at Star with incredulity. "Chubby cheeks?" She almost, almost, asked her why she had a salad leaf in her ass crack. That tossing a salad didn't mean that literally. But she refrained, not only because she fully expected Star to not get that joke, but also because their dynamic wasn't like that. Star was too...innocent to joke around with like that, and Ellesandra didn't want to do anything to make her uncomfortable. She had to pull back the joking attitude she'd brought up around Amelia to back to the typical interactions with Star. Instead, she shook her head and looked thoughtful. "What if we do dinner and discuss strategy and then cocoa for..." She paused. Was she really about to say this? The normal, withdrawn, independent person in her told her she was a fool for thinking it. But the remembered pain from Amelia's words, and how she'd snapped at Amelia for saying something she didn't really know was painful. She cleared her throat. "I think I have a thing or two to process, and cocoa helps with that." She reiterated from the last time she had cocoa. She was actively not looking towards Star, not wanting to see her look annoyed or irritated that Ellesandra wanted her help in processing...something.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The repeated words phrased as a question had Star puff out her cheeks as if they were full of food to mime it out. She then let out the air with a puff and giggled. Then...Pride. That was what held most people back from accepting help. Whether it was pride, or guilt, shame, or something else, she'd certainly see it in Ellesandra. Looking away was...Somewhat pointless. Annoyance and irritation, but was it with themselves? What was the root? Her eyes sought the answer, though ultimately all she cared about was that she was there to support Ellesandra, and did so with a hand on their back. Their armor did dampen the gesture a little, but she'd gotten used to that. "Sounds like a great plan, Ellesandra. Whatever helps, I'm all for it."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

It wasn't entirely pride that held her back from accepting help. Part of it was that she didn't think she deserved help, that she deserved to struggle with this type of thing. Another part was that she didn't want to bother anyone else with her problems. That was the bigger one, having been raised to be so self sufficient when it came to her emotions. Well, that hadn't turned out super well, but still. She would nod, not acknowledging Star's gesture because that would force her to admit she appreciated it or needed it.Instead, she headed up to the bartender to request a couple of basic meals. She made sure to include one of the salads for Star, while getting herself whatever was being offered as the dinner meal for the evening, even if it was just a stew type meal, and then pulling out the coins to pay for it. A glance was given to Star and she looked around the main hall. "Do you want to eat here and then go back? Or would you like to go back and eat food and then come back up for cocoa?" The being outside with Stars had been an idea specifically for Star, since she'd mentioned enjoying looking at them. And maybe the stars in Myst were different - they hadn't really gotten an opportunity to see those.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Hum...Maybe just eat quick here and then head off with the cocoa? Whichever you think is best, don't want to unnecessarily be walking back and forth unless you want to, well...Enjoy the time alone together," she said, not really sure how else to phrase it, though immediately did feel as though she phrased it a bit more romantically than intended. Not that she was going to take that back, no. She was fine with it coming out that way. Happy accident, or maybe just her heart speaking for her instead of her brain. Regardless, she would follow Ellesandra's lead. The meals on offer were standard fare, meat, veg, potato, with some gravy. Salad was also certainly an option, with a good mix of greens and veggies. Today's salad had chopped apple in it as well, but if the plan was to eat more as a satisfaction of need, then it would be eaten accordingly with minimal chatter so they could get to the part Star was most looking forward to.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shrugged, deciding to just get both the cocoa and meals together, and take them back to the location Amelia pointed out. Star was right, walking back and forth for it didn't really make sense. For her part, the comment about spending or enjoying time alone together didn't make sense considering they were going to be alone together either way. Well, 'alone' as in being in a relatively private but still public place. She'd find them a seat that was as private and distant from others as she could though, and would do as she said she would - she'd launch into strategy talk over the actual dinner. The personal stuff could wait until after, until she could have the cocoa held in both hands and close to her, smelling it. "So, i think you've got a good idea of my magical and fighting capabilities already. Though if you weren't aware yet, if you cast a spell on me that would normally boost someone's capabilities in battle, it won't have as much of an effect. It will, however, provide me with additional mana and energy to use my own spells without having as much of a physical cost as they do, like how I was so tired after the fight with the Pirate Captain." She could convert the magical mana into the physical energy that powered her Haste Spell, for example. "So it does have that effect. Or if you are out of range of someone but I'm in range, and closer to them, you can cast the spell on me and I redirect to them. It won't be as effective, a greatly reduced effect, but still - if you're trying to heal someone on the brink of death but they're too far away, any bit might help hold them over until you get closer."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The two moving to the outside space while carrying along their food was a simple affair. When they arrived, it would reveal quite a view indeed. A starry, cloudless sky with an almost too perfect crescent-moon hanging high and bright in the sky. The stars and moon illuminated the ground significantly more than a true night sky would. Even in night, it was easy to see. Not as bright as day of course, but it seemed even the light levels of day and night were tuned by the realm to be utilitarian. It didn't diminish from their outward beauty of course, but some amount of sentimental value might be taken away for some. It was pretty and bright, to some that was all that mattered. Certainly not bright enough to keep people awake, but nowhere near the pitch blackness that some nights could bring. Just subtle enough to probably not notice, while being clear enough to do so if one focused on it. There proved to be entirely...Nobody else in the area Amelia described, set up with benches, though no tables. So it would be a little awkward to eat, more so than if there were tables, but the cocoa sat just as securely on the bench as it did a tabletop all the same. Just meant they had to hold their plates as well. This place was situated at the edge of the athenaeum such that if the two looked over the edge, they would be able to see the cloudy abyss quite a ways down. They were up pretty high, though there was no associated high wind with the height. Star gently nodded to the tactical discussion. "Good to know. I think I can use that to our advantage, though...There's still some...Experiments I'd like to try with you sometime. I didn't mention it but...When you first told me about our resonance and I realized that is what we share, there was a lot that came to mind that would be useful with that. Just, well...You didn't seem too keen on the idea at the time so I didn't push it. But just like how my sympathetic healing sort of...Bypasses your resistance, there's other auramancy I can do with that. It just, well...Requires we actually embrace that resonance, which we haven't." Potential existing, yet untapped. "In lieu of that, well...There's some abjuring spells I know that might be helpful. And if it just gives you mana otherwise, that is...Something," she said, tapping at her lips thoughtfully with the handle of her fork. "Redirection seems like a niche use, but good to know all the same."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Well, she'd expected tables out here. All was well though. She'd set the cocoa on the bench and balanced her food in her lap, eating from that while looking sidelong at Star rather than directly at her. When she commented on redirection being niche, a small smirk spread over her lips. "Niche for an ally to use. Great if a mage decides to cast fireball at me. I can prevent the explosion from hitting those around me by absorbing it and then redirecting it back at the enemy." Oh sure, it still burnt her like a bitch, even if less so than it normally would, but she'd survive it assuming she wasn't already on death's door when it happened. Though something else she said caught her attention. "Will you...elaborate on what you mean by embracing the resonance?" Ellesandra wasn't about to let Star fully feel everything she felt. If that's what she meant, they probably wouldn't embrace the resonance for a long time, if ever. But if there was something more minor she could do to bring the resonance closer and give Star more agency within a fight - well, she'd consider it at least. "And as for abjuration spells, any of them should work if they don't actually focus on me. Like if there is a magical wind that deflects arrows; that wouldn't be reduced necessarily by me. But say - I've seen some people cast shield of faith, or mage armor. Neither of those would have a whole lot of effect, since it's cast directly on my person. That's why I don't interact with portals poorly, but if someone grabbed me and tried to teleport me directly...I honestly don't know how that would work or what the spell would do." No one had ever tried, and she wasn't about to let them unless it was entirely dire circumstances.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Armor of Agathys is more of my go-to, shield of faith and mage armor are good too though," she added idly. "And of course, I saw how you resisted the thunderwave that struck you against the pirate captain. I have the ability to sculpt my spells such that they can avoid hurting my allies, so you having a defensive option for when enemies do things is very useful," she said, perhaps bringing recollection to the initial encounter Ellesandra had with Star. How she blinded the enemies, but Ellesandra hadn't been affected. "As for embracing resonance, well...It's, like a lot of things, hard to explain. I've obviously never done it before but...It's a method of cultivating the connection we already have. Empowering it. I...Admit I don't know everything that might happen from doing it, so even if we do want to try it, I'd...Want to take it slow. It has degrees, you know? Right now just think of it as being at a base level, which is already strong enough to let my sympathetic healing work without impedance. But, remember that shimmering armor I can have? It's what my mother called chromatic aurmancy. It's very powerful stuff, and can do more than just shield me, though that's the only chromatic aurmancy I've mastered so far. And it's pretty taxing on me, but...Hard to argue with its effectiveness. Uh. The reason I mention it is that if we did embrace that resonance, empower it, then I could...Perform that sort of thing on you instead. On your aura, to be specific. And so you can see how making you invulnerable to physical attacks, on top of you naturally being resilient to magic, could be pretty useful in a pinch. It would take some practice on my end, of course. But even if we just did a tiny bit of it, I could perform some more of my usual auramancy on you. Stuff like empowering your stamina, your strength, reaction time, speed...Putting those supportive magics on you on top of your own haste could make you quite the formidable fighter," she said, smiling. "There's just...One thing that I know you might not like about it. Uh...See, at some level of resonance, from what I remember my mother talking about, you'll...Be able to see me, the same way I see you. Just me, of course. Just...My aura. And while that doesn't mean you're going to understand exactly what you see, at least not for a while, I know it might not be something you...Want."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She considered all of the benefits that Star was explaining. That all did sound potentially powerful, especially if Star could take the idea of empowering her physical defenses and actually do it without entirely exhausting herself. Then again, she remembered how tired Star had been after using it against the pirates and she shook her head. "We should try anything that would exhaust you like that, at least not unless necessary. We don't want to have to take too much time recovering just to test something that might not work on me." There was another pause as she processed what she'd be able to see. There was...definitely discomfort there. But there was also some acceptance. At least, Ellesandra didn't dismiss it off hand. She turned to look away from Star, taking another bite and slowly chewing while considering her options. "That's the only thing that will change? Is that I'll be able to see more of your aura? I - Star, I don't like that, but you're already pretty open about your emotions. If it were anyone else, or being able to see other people's aura's too, it would be an immediate no. But at this point...is there anything you'd even try to hide from me, about yourself that is?" She knew Star would hold back information about other people now, but she wouldn't be able to see that. She'd be able to see Star's emotions, and she wasn't aware of Star holding anything back there. Maybe the jealousy that she'd felt before - if she saw what it was directed at? "It's not like I haven't dug around in your aura already. When you were unconscious."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"The only thing I know of. Even that would take time of repeated strengthening. It wouldn't be immediate. Think of it as you becoming more...Sensitive to my aura, and by extension, my magic. When we're actually...Doing the act of it, it'll be at its strongest, and you'll see me wholly and fully during that time. I can make any aura fully receptive to my magic with enough, you know...Forcing it. But what makes this resonance special is how natural it can eventually become. It will allow you to do the same to me of course, though I don't know if any of your magic really qualifies as magic you could cast on me." She gently shrugged. Then, she set her plate down. "As for...If there's anything I'd hide from you, well..." She extended held her hand out, palm up, for Ellesandra to take. "Take my hand. I'll bare myself to you right now. Don't hold back. Accept the feeling and just...Let yourself feel what's in my heart." If they were going to go down this path, Ellesandra would be able to see it anyway in time. She had nothing to hide, even though there were things that had not yet been explicitly spoken.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra frowned at the idea of just becoming more sensitive to Star's aura. That would mean that she'd be able to see Star's aura, even when it wasn't actively being used together? That would mean that there would essentially be no way for Star to be able to keep secrets from her. Well, emotional secrets anyways. It wasn't like Star could read Ellesandra's mind, so it certainly wouldn't work that way the other direction right? But being able to hide emotions. She thought of that jealousy and shifted, a bit uncomfortable at the idea again. "I'm not sure." She said, looking at Star's hand held out, then down to her food. She took another bite then set it to the side, letting her time to chew cover as a buffer for her to consider. Even if Star was comfortable sharing everything right this moment, didn't mean that she'd be comfortable with Ellesandra seeing it in the future. If going forward with this would take that choice away from her, would Ellesandra want to do it? She reached for her cocoa, pulling it up to sniff and sip, eyes closed. Finally, after a moment of silence while holding the cocoa close, she set it to the side and took Star's hand. She didn't look at Star, teeth clenched, but she was accepting this so far. It didn't even take an auramancer to see that she was fighting the discomfort with the idea though - she looked actively unsure about it.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded. "We're not committing to anything. I'm just going to show you what it'll be like for you. So...Please...Look at me, Ellesandra. I want to share at least this with you, no matter what path we walk." she said, then gently took the woman's hand. She guided it to her chest, letting the knight's gauntleted hand rest over her heart. The gentle thumps could be felt just below the surface, dulled by the armor. She pressed both her hands to the back of Ellesandra's own, pushing their armored palm flush against her skin. She kept her eyes on Ellesandra. And with a slow, gentle wash of what felt like a soothing mist caressing all along Ellesandra's skin, Star's aura came to light before Ellesandra's eyes. It was a brilliant, shimmering mixture of colours, predominantly a soft azure. It was almost...Fluid in its appearance, as it had been each other time it had been seen. It flowed over Star in slow, carefree waves. And though the colours meant nothing to someone unaccustomed to it as Ellesandra, the physical connection brought with it Star's guiding hand - both metaphorically and literally, with how she guided it to her heart. Through this, her emotions made sense. There was happiness. Contentment. Serenity. These together seemed to form the blue that took up most of Star's aura. An inner peace that many with turbulent hearts might envy. The result of letting herself be at one with her emotions. It was a...Healthy feeling. The feeling that had been missing when Star had fallen ill. It was reassuring. For someone protective over her like Ellesandra, it would be a strong reassurance that Star was okay. The sort of thing that would allow the knight to rest easy, knowing in the depths of their mind that Star was not in danger, and was happy. There were fleeting traces of other emotion, of course. Subconscious emotions that were being felt and worked through. A bit of that jealousy remained. Some small pieces of aimless uncertainty. Self-doubts. Anxieties. A small void that desired reassurances. Things that didn't need to be addressed, weren't actively affecting Star. But an insight that even Star might not realize consciously that she would be happier if given reassurances. Not that that was a grand revelation - people being reassured was generally a good way to make them feel better even if they were doing all right. But the other contending emotion that was not at all subtle? The other emotion that had yet been unspoken? It was, in this moment, Star's confession to Ellesandra in the identical way as Ellesandra had, albeit unintentionally, confessed to her. The affection. The romantic attraction. The desire for emotional intimacy with Ellesandra - and, to a subdued extent, physical intimacy as well; she could not deny her own desires to surrender her virginity to Ellesandra, even if this moment was about anything but that. But being completely, entirely open to another person meant sharing that, too. There was no...Expectation attached to these emotions. No anticipation. No...Belief that exposure to it would compel action. It could be seen on Star's face, too. She seemed just...Happy. Happy to share herself with Ellesandra in this way, even if it was revealing things that the average person would find very difficult to admit. It needed time and careful nurturing before it might eventually blossom into love but...All the same feelings Ellesandra kept caged deep in their heart, Star felt with freedom and open acceptance for it all to flow through her heart as it needed to, for better or worse.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra did look over to Star, obvious hesitation in her demeanor, but doing as asked. Her hand was taken and placed over Star's heart and she felt that expectation, acceptance flow through her as the area around Star lit up. She'd seen Star's aura before, but she had very intentionally tried not to see it. As in she saw the aura, the colors, but never tried to figure them out. Never put her mind to looking at them and ascertaining what they meant. The feeling as Star guided her sight and mind to identifying them was...odd. The blue was a reassuring, just as Star would have expected. The fact that it took up so much of Star's aura was even better. If this became a thing she could do more often, it may be that she could look specifically for that blue then stop paying attention to the rest. Yet, Star didn't let that happen in this instance. No, she identified the jealousy. The uncertainty and some anxieties. The reassurances needed. They made her eyebrows scrunch up in confusion, wondering if her touches to reassure hadn't actually been doing what she'd intended them to. Or were these verbal reassurances needed? Being told she was pretty and the like? Ellesandra wasn't sure exactly, but she got entirely, totally distracted by just...feeling Star's attraction and romantic feelings towards her. Feeling this did two big things to Ellesandra. First, and probably the most noticeably felt, was a surge of panic. She almost ripped her hand away from Star at the feelings, only not doing so because the tactical part of her mind told her this type of connection might be necessary in the days to come. Still, feeling Star's attraction and interest in her...scared Ellesandra. These weren't just physical attraction, wanting a roll in the hay type feelings. These were more than that. And Ellesandra was suddenly terrified that she was going to break Star's heart, that she wouldn't be able to give Star what she wanted. That she was too broken to be a partner to Star. At the same time, the cage around her own romantic feelings for Star all but actually disappeared. The bars got wider, so that in all intent and purpose, it wasn't actually a cage anymore. Her denial would say it was a cage, say it was locked up, say it didn't exist. But it wasn't even being truly held back, anymore. The feelings flickered and grew, knowing they were returned in kind. Knowing that the potential wasn't just potential, but if Ellesandra went for it, would be a thing - at least for a time. Like responded to like. Ellesandra's active mind was too focused on the panic and not yanking away that she didn't notice, but her heart rate had picked up - and her cheeks had reddened into an actual blush. It stood out easily on her pale skin and white complexion. She didn't speak, unsure what to say or do, and just trying not to hurt Star by yanking her hand away even though every ounce of her conscious mind was telling her to do that.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star kept her smile. She would have felt a little bad if Ellesandra ripped their hand away. But that they didn't, despite clearly being overwhelmed and wanting to, meant a lot to Star. Ellesandra would see it. The way her aura gently brightened, blossoming with a surge of happy feelings. The blush on Ellesandra's cheeks was met with a smile and blush in return. Of course it made Star nervous. Her fingers trembled lightly on the back of Ellesandra's. She had, functionally, just confessed her affections to the knight. There was no way this happened without her blushing brightly. She saw the fear. She saw the apprehension. She let this linger for a moment, then gently pulled their hand away to let it settle back down on their lap. The connection faded. Her aura slowly faded from vision. Still, she smiled, still blushing. "...It's..." How to say this? Ah... "I know it's overwhelming. Just...Take a moment. Breathe. And understand nothing...HAS...To change. Just because we feel something doesn't mean it has to translate to action. But when I was pleading with you to let that part of you live, well...I obviously want it to live in me, too. So...As much as I had been trying to find the right time to make how I felt clear by...Telling you...I kinda feel like this is more fitting. And if it comes to pass that we do empower the resonance between us, well...Regardless of what happens between us, it's only right that you know what you'll be seeing. Every time I look at you...It's going to be there. Those feelings in my heart. I...Hope that helps you see that I have nothing...Nothing at all in my heart that I need to hide from you. You can see me like that any time you want, just as I see you."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took in a deep breath when Star pulled her hand away. That was the permission she needed to pull it back to her own lap and turn away from Star. She clasped her hands together in her lap, then reached for the mug of cocoa to wrap around it, the metal of her gauntlets clicking against the mug. She'd turned away so much that her back was partially to Star. Her breathing was extremely forced, an intentional control of it despite the turmoil of panic and self-doubt within her. On the one hand, knowing that Star was also interested in her should make her feelings easier to act on, right? That hand was so small compared to the other though. The fact that Ellesandra had never been in an actual relationship, and that was what Star wanted. The fact that she was so traumatized and broken, and that she couldn't really process her emotions like Star could. That Star was so open and she was so private to the point that Stars powers alone felt like an invasion - and it wasn't something Star could control. The fear that Star would be able to see if she even had a brief moment of annoyance or irritation at her, something that happened more often with lovers in the past than Ellesandra had ever admitted but she didn't share that out loud. She couldn't be stoic and choose her battles around Star; everything would be a battle. And the biggest thing of all was the feeling that Star deserved way better than someone whose emotional turmoil was already as fucked up as Ellesandra's was. Overwhelming wasn't the right word for it. There was so much darkness, self deprecation and doubt happening within her right now that it almost snuffed out the flames of feelings for Star all together. It didn't, more just covered them so that they weren't being actively felt at that moment, but still. "Star." She whispered, unable to give more force to her voice than just that soft whisper. "That...shouldn't happen. You need to know not to expect...that." It was technically an improvement. Last time, she'd said it couldn't happen. This time, she was saying it shouldn't happen. Not that it would be any less of a potential blow on Star, but still. Her body language was telling Star everything even without the ability to see these feelings in her aura. Her elbows were tucked down close to her stomach, she was leaning over slightly and...well, they were still in a semi-public place, which was the only thing preventing her from fully leaning down onto her knees like she were in a fetal position. But Ellesandra was terrified of hurting Star, of being too broken and too...callous, non emotional, and not worth Star's affection.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's hand gently landed on Ellesandra's back. There was no hurt. There was a world of difference in her mind between a snappy lash-out rejecting everything and what she saw and heard now. Fear. Self-doubt. Darkness. Things that she knew without a doubt were plaguing Ellesandra. She spoke softly, without a hint of sorrow: "I don't expect anything, Ellesandra. I've been saying all along that it's not what comes of these feelings that I care about. Of course there are outcomes I would...Enjoy...But it's difficult to convey how there are things I...Want...But that I have no expectation of it. It's not like I of all people don't understand that emotions are...Complicated." She paused, moving her hand to Ellesandra's armored shoulder in a sign of support. "That the feelings exist at all is a beautiful thing. And they make me happy. That's why I said nothing has to change. It just means a lot to me to be...Open with you. And for you to be as open as you're able to be, with me."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt a lot more comfort from the reassurance that they didn't have to do anything. That there was no expectation of it. That there were feelings, but they could just exist without Ellesandra's refusal to acknowledge them hurting Star. At least, right now it didn't seem to be hurting Star - in the future, who knew. It took a few moments of deep breaths, bringing the cocoa up to her face and just letting the soft steam and smell move up into her nose. The effect was calming, soothing, and that was only added by knowing that Star's hand was on her shoulder. A few moments, and then she straightened, clearing her throat. She'd worked through the panic, but it was still there. It was all bundled around that cage of emotions, unable to touch one without the other creeping up now. Those self doubts, and then of course the fear of having feelings for Star and something happening to her only making the other fears worse. Convincing herself that those feelings weren't worth exploring. She turned back to Star, feeling...sheepish and silly, like she'd just done something that was foolish or childish. "Sorry. I -..." She didn't finish that sentence, not wanting to talk about her inexperience with anything serious, or those self-deprecating thoughts. "So if we were to work on empowering this...resonance...I would be able to see that in you more consistently, potentially without touch? Is there anything else it would do? I have no desire to actually read your mind or anything like that; I honestly have no desire to read your emotions either but if that's part of the package deal that's...that's not so bad, as long as you're okay with and consenting to it."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled as Ellesandra cut themselves off. "Nothing to apologize for," she said quietly. She set her hand back in her own lap after Ellesandra turned back towards her. She kept a close eye on their emotional state. It seemed to be on the upturn, so she was reassured by that. She nodded to Ellesandra's assessment. "You'd be able to see it, eventually. Not right away. But the more sensitive you become to my aura, the more visible it becomes, until it would always be visible. Right now you can probably only see it when it's surging with mana from my own emotions. As for if it would do anything else?" She pursed her lips a moment to the side. "I...Can't say for certain either way. It was around the time I was learning about this concept that everything happened and I was separated from my mother. Mind-reading isn't really the purview of auramancy though, so I wouldn't worry about that. And, Ellesandra, the whole point of me just showing you all that just now was...At least mostly just to show you that I have nothing I care to hide from you, including my aura, my emotions. I'm an open book to you. You don't have to worry about consent on that matter with me, though I understand it's still reassuring to hear it said unambiguously that yes, I am okay and agree to you seeing it any time."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra's emotions were on the upturn in the way that someone who swept all their dirty clothes into their closet cleaned their room. It was still there, just...pushed aside for now. Still something she needed to address and until she did, the romantic feelings she had for Star probably wouldn't be able to go anywhere. Either way though, she nodded. "I understand that in this moment of time you're consenting, Star, but the thing is - your emotions change. Your ideas change. If something happens at a later date that you want to hide from me, you won't be able to. Maybe it's a small pet peeve, not worth calling me out on, but it bothers you every time I do it even if I enjoy it. You won't be able to hide that to prevent tension between us." That was a personal example, since she had a decent amount of frustration with her inability to hide her own frustration at the lack of emotional privacy. This showed on the travel before they got to Myst. "Anyways, though. Let's assume there won't be an issue or you'll tell me and we can stop this connection if there is, later. For now, what do we do with that connection? How do you use magic through it that would be able to help me in a fight? Or vice versa, though I don't know if any of my magic would be able to effect you, or if it would be beneficial at all."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star just kept smiling through Ellesandra's words. "...I feel like I'm not really getting across what my auramancy means to me," she said brightly. A pleasant statement, not a judgmental or frustrated one. "I understand what you're saying. I understand this is a one way decision, no going back. I'm still saying yes. I won't ever want to hide from you, no matter what my emotions towards you are. Good or bad, embracing honesty and openness with all those around me is what it means to be me. I've had struggles, of course. Times of doubt. I might get upset about it in the future but...The darkness passes, when you allow it to. And the most true, strongest bonds, aren't forged out of a lifetime without conflict. They are forged through facing the weaknesses in them and making a bond stronger for it." She looked up at the stars as she spoke these words, smiling to herself. She then looked back at Ellesandra. "Sorry. Didn't mean to go on about all that. For now...Nothing has been done with the connection. Nothing substantial anyway. It allows me to use my sympathetic healing on you easily. But we would need to be together, touching in one way or another, while focusing on the connection to strengthen it. It won't really work with your armor on. Skin to skin contact is necessary for this. Just, uhm," she hastily continued, her face going red as she realized the implications of what she was saying. And while it was true that...more intense, more full skin-on-skin contact made it easier, she wasn't suggesting that. "You know. Holding hands, in meditation. That sort of thing." Awkward glance away, deep breath... "Uh. But once we can do that, it will...Well. I don't know yet. Depends entirely on how strong we can make it. But even if we just nudge it along a tiny bit, it should be enough to let me empower you with some enhanced focus, at the very least. The stronger the resonance, the more powerful magic I can evoke with it."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra listened as Star kind of rambled about Auramancy. In a way, it was cute. If she hadn't just gone through an emotional upheaval, she might have smiled while watching it. Right now, though, she just watched and tried to take in the information. Some of it went over her head, just a matter of not fully understanding the extent of Star's emotional vulnerability and openness, or how it all worked overall. When the skin to skin contact was suggested she pulled back, surprised and her mind going to exactly what you would think it would at that. Star clarifying even just holding hands would help made her nod. "Oh, um. Well we can't do that right now, but when we're back in the room maybe?" She looked down at her armor. Arguably, she wouldn't have needed to wear it today, but that was assuming no one would attack while they were out and about in the city. That type of faith in the city was not one she had. "I don't want to do anything that will wear you out right now, so nothing strong in magic when we do. Just test to see what we can do, push the limits. Is there anything else? You don't seem to be very offensive in spells, but I also haven't seen you use any defensive spells other than that...armor thing you did. The grease spell helped to control the battlefield. Do you have anything else like that, outside of our...resonance?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded at the notion of doing it back in the room as she took her cocoa in hand and set about sipping from it, now that it was cooler. "Building resonance won't wear me out. Kinda the opposite, it's meditative, so it'll be restorative. Not that I'm...Really in need of any more rest at this point or anything. Uhm. When it comes to what I can do, you saw I can make a bright flash for offense, though it's relatively short range and requires the enemy have eyes I can blind, or if they are close enough it can produce a bang loud enough to disorient them for a little. For the average bandit it's usually enough to make them fumble around for a minute or so, long enough to get away, but it's risky to do if I'm alone. People tend to see a magic user doing magic things and respond by stabbing them," she said with a half-joking nervousness. Ellesandra ought to know exactly what it meant to see a magic user and be trained to physically 'persuade' them to not do whatever they were doing. "But that is also auramancy. I know a handful of arcane cantrips and spells, mostly enchantment, abjuration, and divination stuff. Armor of Agathys, Alarm, Dancing Lights, Goodberry, Faerie Fire, Hold Person, Cure Wounds...I've learned a good number of spells, but arcane spells aren't as natural to me as auramancy. The defensive magic armor you see me use was what my mother called the Chromatic Wall. She tried to teach me how to do what she called Chromatic Lance, but I haven't been able to get that to work for me. If I can physically touch an enemy, I can reliably put them to sleep or temporarily paralyze them, but I'm sure you can see the dilemma that I try to avoid getting close to people who wanna hurt me. Oh, and it might be a little obvious but I can see invisible people. All the time. Like, they're still invisible, but they can't hide their aura, so...I can still see their outline."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Well, yeah building resonance might not wear her out but she didn't want Star to practice using this...Chromatic Wall on Ellesandra as a test and wearing herself out with it. She took in a deep breath, still feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of this resonance, but knowing that it was beneficial and worth it in the long run. She took a sip of the cocoa, letting the warm chocolate soothe her insides as if it could actually soothe the emotional turmoil in her. There was interest - and a small bit of being impressed - at the idea of Star being able to see invisible people. That was a lovely little benefit, along with the idea of putting people to sleep or paralyzing them if touched, but she smiled. "You're right, someone uses magic on a battlefield they become a target. Unfortunately I'm pretty sure our enemies already know you can use magic, so no use holding back anymore." There were a few moments pause, and then - "So all that is left would be to practice this resonance? We can do so tonight a little before bed, if you would like. I think you know everything I can do, generally, and unfortunately I doubt any of my magic will work on you even through the resonance. Or if it did your body wouldn't be built for it, as physical of a magic it is."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Oh, I should clarify I don't need to see them specifically, my aura sense works all around me, but vision is probably the easiest and most reliable," she said, hastily clarifying before Ellesandra responded. At the summation, she nodded, then sipped more of her cocoa. "I would like that, yes. And I can't really say I know what to expect with how your magic will interact with mine. Not like there's much past evidence to go on. And I'm not even an expert on my own magic to begin with so..." She gently shrugged. "I'm excited to find out what's to come, if you are. Anything that helps us stay safe and healthy out there is good in my books." Big smile, then more sipping cocoa. She was starting to get quite the taste for it, not just because of her sweet tooth, but just...Associating such nice memories with it, being here with Ellesandra...It might just one day be her own comfort drink of choice.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She let the silence stretch after Star finished speaking that time. She just sipped at her cocoa, looking up into the sky. Yep, this definitely was not a date. If it had been, she'd be able to look Star in the eye, right? Not just stare out at the oddly bright night that Myst provided and sip a comfort drink, trying not to panic about baring emotions together with Star. It just had to be someone that was so emotion-focused she ran into, didn't it? Someone who would force her to process shit. It had only been that morning that she'd broken down and let some of the mountain free, let the grief overwhelm her and sobbed in Star's arms. She took a deep breath again and shook her head. "Well, lets head to the room and get started, then. No use delaying it, it won't make it easier or better." She was hoping that Star forgot about her mentioning that she needed to process something. It...no longer felt like it was appropriate to bring those memories up for Star, since they involved Ellesandra having romantic feelings for someone other than Star. No, best to just try to process that on her own later tonight, the pain that had come up with Amelia's jabs at it being like a date being packed down tightly for now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly had a lot more to talk about, and was in no rush to build the resonance with Ellesandra. There would be time. She gently took them by the wrist, signaling them to stay seated. They hadn't seen a single other person all this time, after all, and she got the feeling Ellesandra would feel better out here than in the room. Maybe, maybe not. "There'll be time tonight. There's no rush, and I don't imagine it will be difficult either way. Let's just...Stay a little longer, Ellesandra. It might be our last peaceful night for a while. I want to talk more. Not about tactics, or 'us'...About you. It's not like I haven't see the way your jaw clenches when you're fighting back your emotions. I watch you stuff them away, even though that doesn't really...Do anything but delay the inevitable." She paused a moment, letting those words sit. "...I care about you, Ellesandra. I know there are things you need to let out, even if you've fought me on that all this time. Cocoa helps you process stuff so...Let's put that cocoa to work while I'm here with you to do my part, too."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There was a flash of anger, irritation at being stopped and told she needed to process things. It wasn't really anger at Star, it was more her emotions being stretched thin. For someone who had spent so much of her life not feeling them, learning to push them down and just distract herself from them, compartmentalize them and forget them - the past few days had been an emotional tidal wave. Between the overwhelming emotions felt from the armor's magic, to the realization of feelings for Star, to Star's aura burst - or whatever - and having to pull jealousy and all of those feelings from her, to breaking down and finally letting herself grieve Marigold, and then the fear, trepidation, and panic at the idea of returned feelings? Ellesandra didn't have the emotional stamina she did physical; she was emotionally strung out, so the anger was a quick lash out. She didn't say anything, to her credit, only clenched her jaw and fell back into her seat with a huff that was more childish than she'd ever admit later, but Star would be able to see the anger nonetheless. She took a sip of the cocoa to cool herself down before she responded, to ensure her words weren't lashing out per say, even if they still had irritation and anger in them. "Have I not processed enough today, Star? I...the other thing I mentioned isn't a good idea to bring up right now, and I don't really have the emotional fortitude to go through what that might cause if I did bring it up right now. So can we just, not?" She said this, but that hadn't gotten rid of the small bit of remembered pain that was still there. How she'd been holding onto it since Amelia's words. And how, at least until the feelings were felt, she'd been a little excited to think of another bit of her past she could share with Star without it being too much. Piecemeal, type situation.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly saw the anger. She wasn't going to push too hard, but she also knew that if she never pushed, Ellesandra would keep to their status quo until it became too much. She didn't like what she saw when they made their agreement of 'no death'. There wasn't the necessary conviction behind Ellesandra's words. She remained unconvinced, so to her, this was the only way she knew how to help. "We don't have to...But why isn't a good idea to bring up? If you're worried about...Upsetting me...Or something like that, then, please don't. I'll be upset if you lash out at me or speak to me in anger, but...If you're just sharing your heart with me, even if the emotions are...Hard...I'll be okay. If it's something else, then, well...Talk to me about it. I'm proud and...Happy as can be with all that I know you have let free from that cage in your heart. But I did promise you it would get worse before it gets better, didn't I? So...We don't have to do anything but...I'd like to just talk a little about you. I like you. I like hearing about you. I already talk too much."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra kind of just...shrugged when Star asked why it wasn't a good idea. After a moment, considering, she added. "When you...had that reaction in our room. The aura poisoning, or whatever it was called. Jealousy was a large part of that." She paused, then continued. "I, um. What I was going to share has to do with at least two other women, one I've been intimate with and one not. But, now that I've felt - well." Now that she'd felt that Star really did like her, had strong romantic feelings for her, and that this is probably where the jealousy had stemmed from - though Ellesandra still wasn't sure who or what Star had been jealous of - she had realized that sharing such parts of her past might not exactly be the best thing for their companionable relationship. She looked over to Star and shook her head. "And, I had no real plan to talk about it, either. I was going to share a memory again. Well, two of them really. Same day but separate situations." Ellesandra was not comfortable talking about herself. And, well, Star had provided a crutch for sharing information without talking about it. Ellesandra would probably take advantage of that, at least as much as Star let her, for the bits of herself she did feel comfortable and want to share with her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile. "It's not like I expect a woman as beautiful as you to be a kissless virgin like me," she said with a bit of a blush. "The poison feeling you felt wasn't actually the jealousy that made me sick. But when I was sick, those poison emotions just got stronger. It's a bit of a...Cascade of failure when it happens. Truthfully I haven't had that happen to me for a long time, a few times since getting separated from my mother, but not again since, well, just the other day. It's not like I can't deal with jealousy. It's...Certainly a new feeling for me, which is why I'm struggling with it. But like these other feelings I know I just...Need to let myself feel it, and let my heart become familiar with all these new feelings. They're still raw. But I'm not gonna lose my mind and fall ill every time you look at a hot professor with a sword," she said, keeping her smile as she rather specifically called out how Ellesandra looked at professor Chamberlain with attraction to try and prove a point that she could handle it. "When it comes to your past, well. The way I feel about it is that, hopefully at least, these people you wanted to talk about, or show me, made past-you happy. It's not like they are actively here, in front of you, threatening to take you away from me. That...Might evoke some deserved jealousy," she said with a small, nervous chuckle. "The only thing I can say is that I'd uh...Prefer to have my first time seeing you, uh...intimately...be something special, between us, if it were ever to happen, rather than through a memory. If it can't be helped, then it can't be helped. Just, y'know. If that part isn't important. And if I'm just making a fool of myself talking about all this when you never planned to actually show me any intimate moments like that in the first place then feel free to interrupt me any time, a-ahahahah...aha..hm.."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She blinked, dumbfounded at the comment of a hot professor with a sword. She hadn't even realized, or thought about, how her attraction to Professor Chamberlain had probably been noticed by Star. Was that why she'd gotten a little upset? The surprise, and then a little bit of amusement, was obvious. The amusement only increased as Star commented about whether Ellesandra would share a memory of her being intimate. She had to bite her lip not to laugh at Star's bumbling words at the end, though she didn't interrupt Star. Not because she intended to share that, but because her rambling like that was...cute. And Ellesandra enjoyed watching it. "No, Star, I wasn't about to show myself and Sophia in the throes of passion. That would be a good way to show you what I like in bed though." The last comment was made with absolutely no intention to follow through on sharing that, but just tease Star and see how red she could make the mage's face. She had to fight down the smirk at the teasing, trying not to let themselves get too much into that dynamic so that those emotions didn't...build. She took another sip of her cocoa to distract herself from thoughts of being intimate with Star. They wouldn't be good things to focus on when they were going to be 'resonating' together later. Goodness, that sounded like an innuendo. "Like I said, two memories. Is that something that can be done, just like - blend one into the next? Or do we need to come out of one then go into the other? Also...is it safe to do that here? Or should we go back to our room?" She had kept her eyes closed while focusing on it before, so she wasn't quite sure how much either of them could be aware of their surroundings while doing this.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star slowly worked herself up into a blush with her rambling. It didn't get any better when Ellesandra came out boldly and talked about showing her what they liked in bed, which had her whole face shooting up bright pink, and a stunned expression landing on her face. Any hotter and steam would shoot out her ears. She didn't even get the chance to remark on how she also knew someone named Sophia, as an offhanded remark just to be involved in the conversation. No, too busy now feeling her heart pound out her ears. A little bit of time was needed for her to collect herself. "U-Uhm," she began, clearing her throat. "B-Blending uh...One into another is easy. And I'm still aware of our surroundings and nearby auras while in that state so...Promise I'll snap us out of it if needed."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Star's absolutely beet red face almost made Ellesandra laugh out loud. God, whoever ended up being intimate with Star was going to be in for an awkward and probably silly and fun first experience. As Star confirmed she could keep an eye on their surroundings while receiving the memories though, Ellesandra glanced around. A sweep for danger, and a slight discomfort at having to rely on Star for that awareness rather than being able to do it herself. Still, this was a bit more comfortable than doing it up in their room. She wasn't quite sure how she wanted to approach this. She sipped more of the cocoa, it almost gone now. She didn't want to finish it, wanting to let the little bit of warmth and smell still in there seep into her nose, the comforting olfactory sensation soothing. "Okay." She said, and then began doing the gauntleted sections of her armor so that she could reach out and physically touch Star. It probably wasn't necessary - Ellesandra didn't remember for sure - but it felt like it would be something that would help. If asked, she'd say she thought it would help the memory transfer, but in reality, it would help Ellesandra. She ensured the cocoa and their food plates were set to the side where they wouldn't get damaged, and then she reached out to take one of Star's hands in both of hers. Her eyes closed, and she would work to put herself in the same state she did last time she shared memories, trying to calm her nerves down. It might take a moment, and just like before she'd follow the instructions that Star gave her to do so and help guide her into opening her 'aura' - or whatever - to sharing the memory she was focusing on. Star would find them sitting in what looked to be some sort of Mess Hall, mid day based on the brightness of the sun coming through windows. Ellesandra, older than the last memory at around 18, was sitting at a table with a handful of people around her. Ellesandra was dressed in basic training leathers with a shield strapped to her back, and a longsword strapped to her left hip. Her hair was up in it's customary pony tail, and she was sitting up, eating what looked to be a hearty lunch with the poise and manners of a noble. To her left sat a tall, blue skinned man - Aeras. An Air Genasi, he was dressed similarly to Ellesandra except his weapon was a warhammer, and he hadn't brought his shield along to lunch. He towered over Ellesandra, a 6'2 height compared to her 5'1, with black white hair that was cut short and a matching goatee. His build was wide, obviously physically stronger than Ellesandra along with the height difference. He was also older, though not quite so old that he had lines on his face; maybe mid to late twenties. Across the table sat a few other trainees, all guys around Ellesandra's age. "El, what are you plans for the festival tonight?" One of them asked, looking up from having picked up a slice of ham and just shoved it in his mouth, not using utensils at all. Ellesandra and Aeras appeared to be the only mannered ones there right now.. To Star's vision, she'd be able to see interest, attraction in him when he looked at Ellesandra. Ellesandra did not return the feelings at all though, in fact there was a bit of dismay and irritation at him asking. And a hidden bit of happiness at what she was thinking about after the question. "Oh, nothing." She said, in a way that implied there was very much something. Aeras smirked, elbow hitting Ellesandra's arm in a brotherly style of nudge. "Didn't the Princess invite you out to watch the fireworks on her balcony, Ellie?" In Aeras, Star would see affection - but not romantic or lustful. It was like that of an older brother, one who Ellesandra had trained with and grown up with in some ways. Ellesandra fought off a blush, her stoic mask and poker face not betraying her to her friends, but inside that happiness seemed to ignite. And there was definite embarrassment. "Yeah, so?" She responded, just as another feminine voice said from over her shoulder - "Oh, deed sheh now?" Sophia had walked up and plopped down right next to Ellesandra, her plate being set on the table with a little more force than had really been necessary. She also was taller than Ellesandra, but only just at 5'4. She was much more full-figured though, a bit thicker and with curves in a way that showed she ate well, and wasn't ashamed of it. Red, wavy hair hung down to mid back, and she chewed with an undisguised glare at Ellesandra. There was definite jealousy leaking out of every pore of her aura, enough that even those without the ability to see her Aura could tell she was jealous. Her accent was heavy, even more so when her temper was about to flare. "Sohnds lyke uh dayte, Ellie." Ellesandra looked sheepish, and confused, over at Sophia. While Star would be able to see not only the jealousy, but actual romantic interest strongly flaring for Ellesandra, Ellesandra's emotions in response were very much not matching. There was strong physical attraction, lust, for Sophia - but absolutely no romantic spark at all. And at her jealous, Ellesandra was both confused and exasperated. There was also a spark of hope at the idea of this being a date with Marigold, but she didn't show that at all. "No it's not a date, she's the Princess. But Soph, we've been through this. What you and I have is physical, I thought we were on the same page there? Even if it was - and AGAIN, it's NOT - that shouldn't bother you?" Oh but to be as naïve with emotions as Ellesandra was, especially at this age. Sophia was obviously hurt by this comment, and there was second hand embarrassment from all around. Sophia grunted and grabbed her plate back up. "Nehva mind, Aye'll sit elsewhere where em wanted." She stalked off, though she didn't sit elsewhere. She just dumped her food and stomped out of the mess hall, ignoring the looks. Ellesandra just looked even more confused and looked around. "What did I do? You all KNOW that I told her I wasn't interested in a relationship, right? I did that in front of people? I'm just not into her that way." "Yeah." Aeras confirmed, then added. "But she's into you that way, El. You can't expect her to just not have those emotions just because you don't." She rolled her eyes, waving a hand. "Well, that's not my fault is it? I was very upfront with her about it. She's a good lay, but there just isn't anything there beyond that." The guys on the other side of the table snickered, but Aeras shook his head. "You're a pig sometimes Ellesandra. You're taking advantage of her interest in you just because she looks like-" Ellesandra felt anger - and a little bit of shame she'd never admit - and slammed her fist down onto the table. "I am NOT!" And then one of the guys across the table cut in - "Why are you so interested in Princess Marigold anyways? Weren't ya like, raised with her? Itn't she more like a sis to ya or something? That's kinda weird." Which did exactly as he had intended. It cut off Ellesandra's anger at Sophia and Aeras, only to have it directed at him. "Shut the fuck up John, I'm not interested in her like that." The denial was real, even to someone without being able to see Auras. Whoever this Princess Marigold was, Ellesandra was all but head over heels for her. Aeras put a gentle, calming hand on Ellesandra's shoulder. "Hey, just be careful okay? You could do a lot worse than Sophia, but if you aren't interested in her you shouldn't join her bed when she has actual feelings involved." He spoke with the soothing, gentleness of someone teaching a lesson to a younger child. From most people, it would have pissed Ellesandra off. From him? She just sighed. "I thought I avoided that issue by making it clear, though. It was just physical." "Yeah, and then you stayed all night and cuddled, and kept going back." John added in, smirking. "Hell, I'd do the same too if she we-" He was cut off by Ellesandra grabbing a roll and tossing it at him, hitting him right in the face. "Shut your mouth John." There was...a protective streak for Sophia. Not out of romantic affection, but it was just Ellesandra's nature to protect those she was close to - friend or lover or romantic interest. This is where the memory began to fade. Ellesandra felt shame for the memory and how she'd treated Sophia, along with a pain in regards to the 'it seems like a date' comments. She forced it into the next memory before Star could comment though. They were directly related, and honestly she was terrified she wouldn't have the strength or willpower to go on if she stopped now. The world shifted into black and then into the next memory, where Ellesandra was standing on a balcony of a castle. It was overlooking castle grounds, able to see the walls in the distance, and then the city just beyond it. The ocean was to the west, moonlight reflecting off of it. There were a lot of lights from the town and the sound of festivities, music being played and townspeople having fun. Ellesandra was dressed nicer than she had been earlier that day, in a suit that would befit a nobleman. It was a light silver-blue color with gold emboss on it, obviously tailored specifically to Ellesandra. It hugged her well despite being a man's suit, fitting to her more muscular statue but still hugging the curves on her chest and hips enough to make her look attractive in it. Her hair was down from it's ponytail, at this point flowing down to mid back. She was leaning against the balcony, nerves alight and wringing her hands when there was a voice behind her - the same one that Star had heard when Ellesandra had cut off the first memory shared on the training grounds. "Ellie, I don't know why you insist on this stuff. I can't get you to eat a piece of the best cake I've ever had because you hate sweets but you'll drink this cocoa any chance you get." Marigold stepped into view as Ellesandra turned around, carrying two large mugs of the hot cocoa. Marigold was 5'5, beautifully kept red hair in an ornate braid that probably took servants a few hours to do in the morning, with a lightly freckled face and bright green eyes. She was wearing a green dress that complimented her hair and eyes well, hugging tight at the waist and bosom but flowing outwards around the legs. She held herself like you would expect any Princess to, even if she seemed more relaxed around Ellesandra. While in Ellesandra, though, you could see that romantic attraction, that hope, burning, Star would be able to see it in Marigold as well just...not towards Ellesandra. When she looked at Ellesandra, it was with a similar affection to that of Aeras'. Ellesandra took the cup and brought it close, immediately sniffing it and letting the warmth and the smell help calm some of her nerves. "You remember, the day you found me? It was the drink you shared with me then. It's my first memory of feeling...safe. You know? It was the most rich and exotic thing I'd tasted or smelled, and it kind of just stuck I guess." Marigold brightened at this, smiling wide with teeth. "Oh! I remember that. You liked it so much I gave you mine too. We were just trying to warm you up I think - it's been so long since then. Father of course wanted to just drop you off at the nearest orphanage." Ellesandra winced. There was pain there - obviously no real love lost between her and the King. "Yeah well, I'm pretty sure he still does. But you convinced him not to, right? I don't actually remember a whole lot from those first few days." Marigold nodded, moving to join Ellesandra at the balcony. She leaned on it with the cup in her hands, hanging out over the grounds while looking out at the festivities in town. "Yeah, Mother helped of course. I hadn't been making friends in the castle and when we found you out there, crying, so when I showed an interest she helped ensure that I could make a new friend if I wanted. I'm a couple years older is why I think I remember it better, but you also just lost your family. Not surprised you don't remember all of it." Ellesandra turned, leaning back against the balcony in a mirror of the posture Marigold had taken, except she was actually sipping at her cocoa while Marigold just held hers. There were more nerves in both of them as Ellesandra said - "You said you wanted to talk about something with me. Something important?" Marigold nodded, not keeping her eyes away from the town. "It's been...fourteen? Fifteen years since we've met, Ellie. You've been by my side through so much, from helping me cheat in my Sylvan lessons to resigning from the main army to be my personal guard. I appreciate that more than you know; I can't imagine having anyone else standing beside me to support me when I take the crown." Marigold didn't mean this the way Ellesandra had taken it, which was a huge spark in those romantic feelings. She had even blushed, though Marigold wasn't looking at her and didn't notice. "Father talked to me today, and...well. We've found someone that we think would be a good person for me. Someone I'm interested in too." At this, Ellesandra looked over to Marigold. Now there was confusion. Her father had never liked Ellesandra, and if Marigold was talking about her, that made no sense. But she was talking about Ellesandra, right? These were the concerned and emotions going through young Ellesandra's aura right then. "Would you be my sister, and Maid of Honor in my wedding to Prince-" The rest of the words just...didn't register to Ellesandra. There was...heartbreak. From an aura standpoint, it was perfectly clear to see. It was as if those emotions had been taken away from all source of fire and dumped into water. The sad thing was, the flames remained. They struggled to survive, while it felt like Ellesandra was literally drowning. Yet through it all, Ellesandra kept a stoic poker face. A disassociated one, that happened almost immediately after the realization of what Marigold was saying sank in. "Of course, Marie." She heard herself say, as if it wasn't herself. The day that had been meant to be a date, that she had denied yet hoped so strongly for it to be so - had resulted in the Ellesandra that began to learn how to disassociate from it all. Whenever something like that happened, she began building that mountain. This wasn't the day that Marigold had died, but this was the day the foundation of the mountain had been built. And that was where the memory faded, back to Ellesandra who was immediately pulling away from Star, turning her body to face away and struggling to contain the pain that had been brought back in full force at it. Not only that rejection she'd felt there, but the later grief of still losing her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had a lot to think about as she watched these two memories play out. She had a great deal of things, angles, emotions, to consider. It was, like so very many other emotional matters, a complex thing. Someone was falling for Ellesandra. Ellesandra didn't return it, and had what she felt confident calling at least a precursor to love in Ellesandra towards Marigold. It was strong. It had to be. It couldn't hurt so much otherwise. But whether it truly befit the word love was difficult to know for certain unless she focused on the emotion for a while. Time, she did not have. There were obvious parallels to the current situation. It gave meaning to the hot cocoa. It gave meaning to why Ellesandra was so emotionally closed off. It gave a name to the woman, Marigold, whose handkerchief Ellesandra still carried. But it had Star thinking about what she'd seen in Ellesandra's aura when she suggested the notion of whether the power Ellesandra might have with the card would be enough to revive someone. To revive Marigold was the obvious desire she saw spark in them. But Marigold didn't return Ellesandra's feelings. That was...Obvious, wasn't it? Not that it was the only reason Ellesandra would want to revive them, but she did sincerely worry if it might be something the woman considered as a chance to be with the princess again as a lover. A chance to bridge feelings that weren't reciprocated. A desperate emotion, certainly. Not one she blamed Ellesandra for, but one that was suffuse with poison for one's heart all the same. When everything was done, Star coming back to focus, she didn't stop Ellesandra from turning away. But she did scoot closer so she could reach one arm across Ellesandra's back and rest on their opposite shoulder while moving to lean her head on them. "...There's nothing that you would have needed to worry about in sharing all that, Ellesandra. Love, in all its forms, whether it is fully blossomed or simply budding, or sparking and yet to form fully, is a beautiful thing. And she was a beautiful woman. The bond you two shared...I couldn't possibly know all there is to it. But even with what little you showed me, it is clear how much she meant to you. Though your story is rife with tragedies I...Hope there are still happy, beautiful memories you can hold onto. You don't have to talk right now, if you're still letting yourself feel. We don't have to talk. We can just...Be here. But...If there is anything about that you want to say...I would really want to hear it."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra kept her back to Star, even as she felt a hand on her shoulder. She seemed to be keeping well enough control of her pain, at least enough that she wasn't crying. However, the fact the pain was there, raw and sore, didn't change. How Amelia's comment about this being a date had reminded her of Sophia, and how poorly she'd treated the healer then. How she didn't want to do the same to Star. How the idea of that being a date, because they had cocoa out amongst the stars, was one that brought back some very real heartbreak. It was why she'd lashed out, for Amelia daring to make her feel that again, even unintentionally. The thing is, she had loved Marigold. Whether she was in love could be debated. Was it the type of 'true love' that people aspired to? No, but Ellesandra also didn't believe in such a thing. Yet she felt it was important to reprocess that memory and feeling, since it was the source of where the mountain grew. Where she had begun truly putting her emotions aside, since it had been necessary to do her job. She stood by Marigold as she'd been married, and if Ellesandra hadn't protected herself the way she had, she wouldn't have been able to do that. "What is there to say?" She asked, after a lengthy silence. Her voice was hoarse from holding the pain in. But unlike before, she wasn't pushing it down. She was just holding it back enough she didn't break down. "That was the start of me doing this. That's...that's all."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star slowly closed her eyes, just taking a moment to be against Ellesandra. To be close to them. To comfort them. Her presence was always that much more comforting because of her auramancy; being able to connect with someone on a level below the surface and have one soul speak to another and say silently 'I am here for you'. It did not mend emotional wounds the way magic could close a bleeding gash. But it certainly would help Ellesandra keep composed as those emotions were allowed to flow through them as Star would say they should have been the whole time. "There's a lot you...COULD say. But if you don't want to say anything, that's okay, too. If you want to talk? Then you can tell me about what you're feeling. Tell me whatever comes to mind when you feel it. Tell me the good times with Marigold. Tell me what you liked about Sophia. Tell me about the times you weren't trying to beat the snot out of your comrades in arms. Tell me about you, Ellesandra. Those are things you can say, if you want to. Everyone deals with pain in their own way. I just...Want to help you so you are actually dealing with it, not...Ignoring it. It's been hurting you this whole time and...I don't much like anything that hurts you."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra reached for the cocoa, even though it was empty. She brought the empty mug and held it in both of her now bare hands, squeezing tightly on the mug. Her lips pursed and she closed her eyes, trying to think of something positive. Good times with Marigold were out of the picture - they would bring up too much pain with her gone now, even if they were good times. Sophia was an option. She didn't know when she wasn't trying to beat the snot out of her comrades in arms - though that was entirely just their relationship and how they showed they cared for one another. Except Aeras, but he hadn't really been a 'comrade' per say. He'd been established before she'd met him, and she was still in training. "I met Sophia." She started, trying to focus about that. Focusing on something that would distract her from the pain she felt. "When I first came back from my squireship. I was...about fifteen?" Keeping a specific age when she didn't know her age upon being found was hard. But around that age. "Sixteen, maybe. Old enough to know I liked girls, young enough to not understand the difference between lust and love. She's a healer, and she's...well, she's the type of healer who will hit a patient over the head if they're being difficult and knock them out so she can do her job. Fiery. And it shouldn't have been a thing to even be concerned about, but she was so...unapologetically herself. There were people who tried to bully her because she was bigger than a lot of the other soldiers, healers, women, and she just put their head under her arm and gave them a knuckle sandwich." A shake of her head. "Woman had a self confidence I could only dream of."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled. That was nice. It might have been strange for Ellesandra that hearing them talk nicely about a woman from their past they were sexually involved in didn't inspire jealousy in Star. Of course, Star wanted that intimacy. There might be a tiny hint of envy, just that she wanted what others had but she didn't, but Star was simply...Not an envious person. Her first foray into romantic affection with Ellesandra certainly was making her feel all kinds of nasty things that came with the territory, but...When the initial period of this passed, she would come to master herself and be free of these jealous flareups at other people, too. Star gave a soft giggle. "It's easy to admire that sort of person, isn't it? People who know who they want to be, who can reach out and be that person, get over that fear...It can be inspiring. Rightly so. Because we can all do that, I believe. Just, well...Much, much easier said than actually done. Is that whole being knocked out to let her do her job something you're telling me from experience? Or did she just feel the same frustrations I have about regular healing being about as effective as kissing the wound and saying nice words at it? Because my goodness does it take everything out of me to fix you, eheh.." she paused a moment, then added, softer: "...But that's not gonna stop me from doing it every time. My heart can't bear to see you hurt."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head, though it was mostly at herself. "Yeah, I kept telling her that healing me was useless and she may have hit me over the head hard enough to make my vision blur. And by the time I was looking around again, she had already expended a lot of energy to heal the small cut I had." She squeezed at the mug a little, feeling a little uncomfortable at what Star had said. There was...definitely a response at the idea of 'kissing the wound and saying nice words at it'. There was arousal with it. The thing was, Sophia had done exactly that before. Granted not for a serious wound, but still. "I'm sorry healing doesn't work right on me. And that the only way you can actually do it is to take the pain on yourself, which I'm still not comfortable with." She shrugged a little, but then finally began to turn back to sitting forward on the bench. The mug of empty cocoa still in her hands, she glanced briefly over to Star. "I hate this stuff, Star." The words sounded defeated, irritated. She wasn't, she was going through this whole processing shit, but she hated it. "I honestly don't know how you do it."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled at the memory. It might have been a bit troublesome at the time, but being able to reminisce on it now, knowing that Sophia was doubtlessly doing their best, even if maybe a little misguided, felt nice. Star shook her head, adjusting to ensure Ellesandra could sit how they wanted, though she kept contact with them, even if that was just keeping her head on their shoulder. "That's not the only way I can do it, that's just the easy way. I'm practiced enough as a healer that I can manage to mend even more serious stuff on you, it just...Takes a lot. A lot more than it ought to. I want to use my sympathetic healing more, but...You being comfortable takes priority so long as it's not an emergency." She then smiled again, hearing Ellesandra say how much she hated it. "I know you do. And one might say I have a bit of an unfair advantage in being so attuned to this stuff. Those same people might say you have an unfair advantage when the matchup is you versus someone who only knows magical offense. We each have our gifts. But...Truly, my powers don't give me any special capacity to deal with emotion. For a long time when I was young, I was sick. My mother told me that the same was true of her. And if the day comes that I have a child, it'll be the same for them, most likely. I was born with my powers, after all. So the world has always looked this way to me. You, well...I showed you what it's like to see just me. But remember that I not only see everyone that way, but I see...Clouds of emotion. Lingering remnants of powerful emotion and the memories, the moments that created them. The world to me is a sea of colours. And it's a beautiful thing to me, truly. But as a child? It was terrifying. Confusing. Any time I didn't understand why I felt a certain way, it had that chance of going out of control and making my aura...'break', so to say. The only source of comfort in my life, the only place that made sense, was when I was with my mom. Whenever she held me, the world felt calm. The world felt like it made sense. The colours, instead of being...Noisy, and blinding, became soft and inviting. Changed from the sounds that remind me of iron swords clashing on a battlefield to the sounds of birds singing their sweet songs. There was guidance, yes, but...It truly came down to just...Exposing myself to it all and letting it live in me so I could feel it, understand it, and come to a better understanding of myself through it all. That's all this is, Ellesandra. These things in your heart aren't going anywhere when you shove them away. Bringing it back up can be hard, I know. I'll say it again...It gets worse, before it gets better. But even these dark emotions are part of you, beautiful in their own way, for they morph into something genuinely bright and beautiful once they have had time to live in you for the time they need. Hurt gives way to strength. Loss gives way to the want for love again. Sorrow gives way for happiness. Denial gives way to acceptance. Turbulence...Gives way to peace. It's a never ending battle, Ellesandra. But if you want a small example...I remember seeing how you felt when that evil man called you short, thinking he was so funny. I can only imagine the kind of trouncing you have given to people over the years, people who have underestimated you for your stature, only to find that your fiery determination was a thousand times greater than they ever imagined it could be. You being a tiny bit on the shorter end for a woman is just...One part of who you are." She moved a hand to gently take Ellesandra's bare hand to squeeze it, here, arriving at the culmination of her point: "I can tell you from experience...Once the storm passes, you feel better. There's light at the end of it all. And for whatever it's worth...You're not facing any of it alone."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She took in a deep breath, shaking her head. She hated how it took everything out of a healer to heal her, and the alternative for Star hurt her. Though in a way, it was nice to know that it was still an option, even if Ellesandra would never actually ask for it. She listened as Star continued on, explaining how it was overwhelming as a child and how she didn't just get good at this type of thing overnight, along with the prep talk about everyone being good at something. The short comment made her almost smirk, thinking about all of the times she'd been called a shorty on the training grounds and made people regret underestimating her for that. After a few moments, she moved to stand up, pulling away from Star. She did not leave, but just stepped away far enough to stretch and put some distance between them. On the one hand, Star touching her was comforting. On the other hand, it made her emotions even more difficult and hard to understand, what with how she enjoyed the touch. "Well." She said, trying to just...brush all of that off. To pretend that it was something small, not as big as it had been. "Are you ready to attempt this whole resonance thing? We can become musicians and resonate enough for a whole musical number." She was trying to joke, to lighten the mood and distract from the fact she was withdrawing again. It wasn't the same as before, but it was an active point of it being too much right now, and needing to get back to normal topics.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could tell that even before all of that, Ellesandra needed a break. She needed to push them, needed to take the opportunity that presented itself, but even for someone who wanted Ellesandra to push through everything to feel better like Star it was obvious. A little levity. A little normalcy was needed. She was glad to be able to capitalize on this time together where it was safe, where they could focus on each other. But the time was nearly up. It was going to be time to go to Gurhal very soon, and once more deal with a lot of things that would distract from this. Star got up to join Ellesandra and mirrored their stretch. "We will make beautiful music together!" she said, ab-so-lutely unaware of what the implications of that phrase were. "I heard Nina say that to someone once," she said, turning her back to Ellesandra to get their dishes gathered. "She had a nice singing voice. Though I don't remember her girlfriend playing any musical instruments...Maybe they were a singer, too," she said, thinking aloud as she got things together to turn back to Ellesandra, ready to go along and return everything before going to their room where they could do their nightly rituals and get prepared for their attempted strengthening of their resonance.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the corners of her mouth turn up at Star's comment. She considered long and hard whether or not to share the joke with Star, knowing it would make her blush up a storm - and potentially change how she felt about this Nina person and their girlfriend. After another moment, she decided to share the joke, if only to be fully honest to Star. "Making music together means making eachother orgasm loudly, Star." Her explanation was very dryly delivered, as if it were nothing to laugh at or to be ashamed of. She kept her stoic mask up while watching Star, preparing for her flustered response. She would head back to their room though, taking their dishes back to the bar first before going up to get out of her armor and everything. She went slowly about this, dreading the idea of working through this resonance and being able to see more of Star's emotions. And maybe potentially see how she felt about everything she'd seen in the memories before. She was nervous, but did not hold back from preparing, like you would when about to do a chore you disliked doing.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star froze in place. "Gah..." was the only sound that came from her as the joke was exposed. She at least knew how Nina was...Hardly surprising that they would make a joke like that, but boy oh boy did she not expect that to be what it meant nor did she intend on just saying that right out loud casually to Ellesandra. Yet at the same time, part of that made her...Excited. Aroused. It gave her a flash of desire to be touching Ellesandra intimately, to make good on that joke, make it real. Her legs and arms went a little numb at the cascade of thoughts, and she was subsequently silent the whole way back to the room. Things were dropped off, and Star insisted on taking a shower. Not that Ellesandra would know, but it was certainly a cold shower. She came back out dressed in the spare civilian clothes she had, wanting to keep her enchanted outfit decent for the next day where it might matter. Then, she moved to join Ellesandra on their bed, hair still damp behind them, and set about focusing. The position she assumed Ellesandra wanted to take was just cross-legged and facing each other, hands together, but there were...Options that would make it either easier or harder, depending on the amount of contact their bodies could make while performing this act.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't expect Star to completely go silent. For a moment, she felt guilty about sharing it, wondering if it had made her uncomfortable. By the time Star got out of the shower, Ellesandra had gotten out of her armor and and was in a spare set of clothes. She was sitting on her bed, looking up when Star came out, frowning. "I'm sorry, if that comment and explanation was too much, Star. I know you're still pretty new to all of this and..." She trailed off, not sure how to explain it. She just wanted Star to feel comfortable, and not forced or intimidated by any of the sexual comments Ellesandra might let slip occasionally, like when with Amelia. Still though, she had been sitting there, ready for whatever this resonance would be like. Her hands were bare, and her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows so there could be more contact there if needed. She wasn't sure what exactly Star would need for this, but she had mentioned that the more contact there was, the better the resonance would be. Ellesandra was entirely taking Star's lead for it though, not sure what to do.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently shook her head, blushing again. Ah, they brought it up again? She just got out of the cold shower... "It's not that any of that makes me uncomfortable, really. I mean. I'm an adult woman who has plenty of...Thoughts...Ideas.." Fantasies. "I've heard plenty from others. Just because I haven't actually done any of those things myself doesn't mean I haven't been exposed to it. If anything it makes me...W-Well..." She cleared her throat, hoping she wouldn't have to say it aloud. "Coming from you anyway," she added, much more quietly. A dirty joke from a sleezeball wouldn't get her going, obviously, but anything that put the mental image of Ellesandra and herself, together, intimately, in her mind? Well, there were obvious consequences. "N-Never mind that. That'll just distract from what we're trying to do!" she declared, moving to sit opposite Ellesandra, matching their posture with sleeves slowly rolled up so she could slip her hands along Ellesandra's forearms to grip at their elbows, or just before. Mirroring her was the obvious suggestion. Probably for the best they weren't taking on some extreme barely-clothed approach, because Star wasn't sure how well she could concentrate in such an intimate scenario, regardless of how beneficial the additional skin contact would be. Once they were situated in this position, Star closed her eyes. "...Just relax. Close your eyes, and focus on me. I will focus on you. It will take a bit of time where not much is going to feel like it's happening I think. But once we're doing it right, you should be able to feel...Me. And I should be able to feel you. Not just emotions, though there will be that. Not our thoughts, but...Each other's presence. The physical, the emotional, and spiritual. I've also been told there's a chance it'll have us be in a...Trance-like state, but other than that I don't really know what to expect. This is new territory for me, too so just...Bear with me."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra immediately felt more regret at having made the comment. It only brought to light again Star's feelings for her and her desire to be intimate in a way that Ellesandra was definitely not ready for. If Star had come to her and asked her to be fucked, with no emotional strings attached, Ellesandra would be happy to do that. But to be intimate in the way that Star surely wanted to be? The panic stirred again. She forced a swallow down and clenched her jaw shut for a moment, before mirror what Star was doing and closing her eyes as she was told to. She pushed these feelings back down, not wanting them to be a major point of interest while Star was touching her or they were trying to resonate. This felt...odd. She didn't answer Star's instructions, but she attempted to follow them. Ellesandra had meditated before - it had been part of her training in becoming one with her body and checking in on injuries or soreness in it. But her meditation previously had been very focused on doing physical body scans; this was just focusing on Star. And she struggled to do that without her thoughts going, which kept causing her to stop focusing on Star in order to push those thoughts down, then restart the whole process. Her hands squeezed Star's arms each time she had to restart, though unless something just immediately started to connect between them, Star would feel Ellesandra's frustration stirring. Ellesandra didn't act on it, the frustration at herself more a distraction than anything, but it would become noticeable as any time attempting this lengthened.

Star could see the awkward regrets as the sexual jokes stirred feelings that Ellesandra didn't want to entertain. It was hard to feel this way about someone and actively see them trying so hard to not feel the same. Was it concern it would spiral out of control? It didn't matter in the moment. It was pushed aside. But even pushing it aside, it was not gone. So when the meditation began, each of them focused on each other, Star was given a very clear display of Ellesandra fighting against the feeling...And Ellesandra was given wave after wave of Star's romantic affection and attraction in turn. She did not fight it. So Ellesandra felt it all each time they focused on her. And each time focus broke, it lessened. Then each time the attempt to resume followed, it came flooding back. Each time Ellesandra broke concentration to fight with themselves, it put them back to square one. Not an ounce of progress was gained. "Ellesandra...You need to stay focused. You need to let everything flow naturally through you. Nothing is going to happen right now. Once you relax fully, no matter what you feel, it won't...Lead to any action. So please...Do you very best. Relax. Focus. Stop fighting with yourself."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

"Easier said than done." She muttered. Ellesandra was in strong denial about her feelings for Star. Her feelings were there, 100%. Star could see and, maybe, feel them in this. But there was so much fear packed around them. Self-doubt in her ability to be an actual partner to someone. Fear that she would let herself care for Star, like she'd cared for Marigold, and then she'd fail Star as her guard just as she did with Marigold. Fear of the past repeating itself. Fear that she was already too broken and too...not good for someone as innocent and pure as Star was. This was why she kept pushing those feelings down, which just became harder and harder the more she felt Star's feelings for her through their touch. Eventually, she was able to stay focused on Star for more than just a couple minutes at a time. Letting Star's emotions flow, and feel them, was foreign to her. Her natural response was to shove her barrier down, to split them up and not intrude upon Star's feelings. It wasn't even a lack of wanting to intrude, but also a recognition that she truly didn't want to feel what Star was feeling. Yet, she tried to. The affection and attraction, and any other feelings that Star sent through, Ellesandra began making their own little corner in her own emotional being that she sent them. She felt them, briefly, but began trying to instead of dwelling on them, push them to the side inside herself just like she did with her own emotions. To keep them separate from herself, so as to not confuse their affection and attraction towards one another as mutual, even if it definitely was.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

As much as Ellesandra may try, they unfortunately would not have the same degree of control over Star's emotions that were felt through this connection that Ellesandra had over their own emotion. Redirection, putting it in a cage, trying to not feel it wasn't possible, as it wasn't Ellesandra's to feel or not feel. It was Star's. To manipulate that would require an adeptness with auramancy that only one of these two women had. There was already a clear divide; the feelings were intrinsically understood within Ellesandra's heart to not be their own emotions. Just as with Star's calm, her inner serenity, her happiness, her tiny flecks of frustrations and fears and doubts and all the other small emotions she wasn't actively feeling, but was there. Star, likewise, felt the mutual attraction, felt the fear and doubt that caged it. She knew the whole time that it was there, but she wasn't going to shove that in Ellesandra's face. They had to face all of those things at their own pace. She could guide them, she could comfort them, but she could not force them. But Star's attraction would not be felt as if it belonged to Ellesandra; any attraction, affection, or emotions of the sort that Ellesandra felt and understood to be their own were, simply, their own. But as difficult as this might all prove to be for Ellesandra, the extended length of focus achieved the spark of connection that Star had been trying to foster. And with that began a helpful feeling to combat all the fear and doubt and anxiety that Ellesandra felt: Calm. A relinquishing of physical feeling. Like their inner self was lifting out of them, wafting away to a dreamland. Ellesandra was being pulled into a trance. They could snap themselves out of it before it set in of course. But if they allowed it, then a soothing wave of unconsciousness would fall upon them, taking away all the inhibition and fears that made it so hard to focus on Star. And if they accepted, they would blissfully awaken looking up at a beautiful night sky filled with stars while laying in a field of pretty white flowers, clad in a pure, modest white sundress as the cool, refreshing night breeze tickled their skin. They could stand, look around, move around. But it was clear to them that they were not dreaming, nor strictly awake either. This was...A peaceful place. It was calm. Ellesandra was alone entirely, except for, of course...Star. She stood up a ways away on this infinite field of white flowers, clad in an identical white dress. They were too far away from each other to speak. But Ellesandra would be able to tell, be able to feel, that Star was there, and that she knew Ellesandra was there as well, and that Star was...Happy.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra might be able to recognize that they weren't her emotions to push to the side, but as she briefly felt them coming through her connection to Star, she had still tried. Failed, but tried. It was her go to reaction for emotions and things that made her uncomfortable, trying to separate them to deal with little bits at a time rather than all at once - or just not deal with them at all, as typically happened. She felt when the connection seemed to...snap into place. The calm that flowed through, the slight tug into a trance like state. She hesitated, fighting her initial reaction of jerking away from it and breaking herself out. She wanted to just pull away and say fuck it, to say they were fine and didn't need to work on this resonance. But the thought of how that would hurt Star, and wasn't the best tactical move, made her allow the trance to come over her. When she woke in a field of flowers, staring up at a starry sky, she looked around in...confusion. Confusion at where she was - where THEY were, because she could feel Star in the distance. Then confusion at why the hell she was wearing a dress - she hadn't worn a dress since she was a child. Then confusion at the fact that, despite having been pulled into some other dream scape like thing and knowing she should be frustrated at this, with how often it had happened at Black Diamond and Sapphire's hands, she didn't feel frustrated. She just felt...calm. She stood slowly, looking around and self-consciously smoothing the sundress down. Looking down at herself in a sundress was a little odd, but she ignored that to begin moving towards Star. If there was a path that didn't require her to trample flowers, she would take it, unsure what this dreamscape might imply and if she was somehow in Star's mind or something, she didn't want to be destructive here. "Star?" She called towards the auramancer, feeling the happiness coming from her which was...an odd thing to recognize and notice.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

As Ellesandra stood, the realm recognized their desire not to step on the flowers. So Ellesandra could watch as a dirt path just...Appeared where it hadn't been before, recognizing it wanted to go to Star, and thusly extended in their direction. It extending to be under Star's feet naturally had her look down and move along the path towards Ellesandra. It was a slow walk. The realm beyond extended infinitely. Just a plane of flowers, lazily rolling up and down as earth tended to do, but mostly flat. As the two walked towards one another, there began to form...Wispy lines of colours in the air. One such wispy line flowed on the breeze and passed through Ellesandra's chest. As it did, Star's voice rung out. "...I do keep asking you to trust me, but...I understand that that doubts I see in you will remain. I hope only that I can prove in time that I have aimed to be trustworthy at every step. You did save me, after all." It wasn't Star, the actual woman who was walking towards them speaking. It evoked a memory. A memory of near when Ellesandra and Star first met. Another one followed a minute or so later, passing through Ellesandra like the wind. "I know it sounds silly. But since we'll be here for the rest of the day...Let's come back here to look at the stars tonight, once the sun sets. See how beautiful it really is." - Yet another echoing set of words from the past, heard in Ellesandra's mind. Another followed shortly after, each one flowing freely on the winds and carrying with it the emotions Ellesandra felt at the time, but in a retrospective light. Inner reflection, rather than directly reliving the moment. "There. Consider yourself hired, then." These words came with a bag of coins dropping down on the dirt path in front of Ellesandra. THE bag of coins. A few pieces of platinum spilled out as it landed on the dirt at her feet. It then burst into motes of white light, vanishing. One last one passed through them, this one carrying a wave of desperation, of fear, of panic: "...Please, Ellesandra. Let me heal you." The shaky, frightened voice of Star echoed with her pains and fears that rivaled Ellesandra's own, fear that she would lose Ellesandra, that the knight would die when she was right there, able to heal them. Each of these memories carried echoes of what Ellesandra felt in the moment, be it their pain or fear or anguish or happiness or levity or whatever else...But they also carried echoes of what Star felt. Momentary glimpses into their shared time together, from both perspectives. The two were still a fair distance away from one another. Too far to talk. But Star's presence was still there. It still brought with it the overwhelming serenity that helped carry Ellesandra through these memories; even through the harder emotions, she was there, and her presence fought off the crippling damage that any painful echoes might try to do, just as she had fought off Ellesandra's nightmares.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra froze when the path suddenly just...appeared. That unsettled her, not knowing what the rules were for this place. Was it just an express your will type of dreamscape that she could change it? Was it Star's will that was changing it, in respect to the feelings and wishes she felt in Ellesandra? Either way, she'd begun walking towards Star, still hesitant and concerned about the setting they were in, even if there was an odd feeling of calm all throughout those concerns. The little wisps of emotion that went through her made her freeze at first, until she realized that it was...memories. Or was it just the emotional memories? She heard Star get frustrated at her not letting Star heal her, at her officially being 'hired', at the request to be trusted. Well, Star was trusted now - trusted enough that Ellesandra was sharing this with her, letting herself become potentially vulnerable with her in a way she hadn't let herself in a long time. Yet, there seemed to be at the same time an infinite distance between her and Star, causing Ellesandra to look around. Was there a...faster way there? If she just wished to be next to Star, would she suddenly be there? Ellesandra tried, hoping to skip any of the random emotional memories that...well, it wasn't that they were uncomfortable or bad at all, but more than Ellesandra was still uncomfortable with this type of vulnerability.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The world around Ellesandra seemed to be at least partly under their control. They willed the path, it appeared. They wanted to be closer to Star? And suddenly, they were close. The desire was made manifest. The last few steps closed, and Ellesandra and Star were before one another. Star smiled at Ellesandra. Star's hair wasn't in its usual style here. It was in a twin braid, like Star had worn during that memory of her childhood that had been shared. The two braids of snow-white hair were cute, tied with pretty blue bows at the bottoms. And with the two of them standing close to one another, a faint white light shimmered over Star's heart, as well as over Ellesandra's. From these two white lights, a wispy line of mana extended between the two. A line that had always been there, clearly, but was only visible in this...State. This place. It was their connection. Their resonance. Star kept her eyes on Ellesandra. She rose up a hand, palm flat and facing Ellesandra, inviting them to mirror her and press their palm to hers. "...This is the moment we can strengthen our bond, Ellesandra. Touch my hand with yours...And open your heart. The stronger your desire...The more you can open yourself...The more you let me in...The stronger our resonance can become."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She blinked, a little surprised that it worked when she suddenly appeared near Star. There was a moment of taking Star in, eyeing the two cute braids and bows, appreciation and attraction filling her for a moment before the attraction was pushed down again. The light between the two of them was also something that was inspected, Ellesandra reaching a hand up to touch it as if she could just pluck at the string between them like a musical chord. Only after attempting to do that did she look at Star's hand and mirror it, grumbling. "Open this open that, everything you ask me to open is something I don't like opening, Star." The grumble was one of resigned acceptance, though. She did try to open herself - try being the key word. She had no strong desire to open herself in this way, but she did desire to empower Star and make her stronger, more useful in helping Ellesandra in keeping her safe, and that desire was the main thing that was leading her to do this...if it counted for this desire at all. Oh, there was desire for Star too, a desire that was strong but well leashed and controlled, not being allowed to come up to the forefront, but she wasn't sure if that mattered in this dream state. Did her ability to hold her feelings back count at all right now, when they were being so open and vulnerable with one another?


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The white connection between their hearts responded like smoke when plucked. Affected by the motion, but it wasn't tangible. It also did remain in one, contiguous piece the whole time, but was sent slowly drifting along the direction Ellesandra plucked it before moving back into its resting place that, itself, was slowly shifting and fluid. Star giggled at the grumbles, but didn't say anything. Attempts to repress emotion were more or less moot. Everything felt more raw, controlled by waves of calm rather than inhibition and repression. The feelings didn't come with compulsion for action, but they also weren't able to be pushed down or minimized in this state. Ellesandra wasn't their whole self in this moment, though fragments of their whole self remained on them as a shell that was slowly eroding the longer they remained in this trance. Ellesandra was looking into themselves, seeing their most core emotions. Star was on careful control of the moment, to ensure that the torturous emotions of the looming mountain of grief were kept away. Calm. That was what had to be maintained for this to work. When their hands pressed together, Ellesandra felt the connection pulse. It was a familiar pulse. It was something that Ellesandra had felt when Star went off, ultimately leading to her aura 'breaking'. The connection was...Powerful. Power surged through Ellesandra, letting them feel Star's presence and mana melding with them. She closed her eyes. The empowering feeling was...Good. It felt good. Very good. Emboldening. Strengthening. Healing. Ellesandra was able to feel her own senses sharpen. Awareness of her surroundings became clearer. Her muscles felt tighter, more under her command. Her right arm's dull ache soothed - though not actual healing was transpiring. But the potential was clear. And then, a dull throb in Ellesandra's chest. Then another. Then a stronger one. Then, even stronger. A growing, powerful thud. A heartbeat. Star's heartbeat. Ellesandra's and Star's were out of sync initially. But with each beat, they grew closer to one another. More in sync. Until Ellesandra felt both hearts beating together, as one. When they were out of sync, it was mildly painful. The closer they came to being in sync, the less it hurt, until finally the synchronized beats felt...Good. Very good. And at this moment, the white line between their hearts began to glow. The emotional barriers between them were stripped away, and Star began to glow with her aura for Ellesandra to see clearly as her emotions blossomed through the connection. The happiness, calm, the desire, the affection, the concern, the fear of losing them, the want to be close, the safety she felt in their arms and at their side, the flood of anxious feelings reminiscent of a schoolgirl falling in love for the first time, though tempered with very much adult perspective that had much clearer, more sexual eventualities and fantasies that surely sprung from it. Emotions that evoked mental images of the two of them nude, bare bodies pressed together with hands roaming one another. But her desires were not entirely that - the desires she felt equally evoked sensations that brought to mind sitting together watching a sunset, or looking at the stars and simply being content with one another; feelings that evoked a sense of fighting side by side on the battlefield to protect each other and those they loved; of being by Ellesandra's bedside to nurse them back to health; of being there for Ellesandra, regardless of if she was a friend, a lover, a wife, or just an ally. Different permutations existed, but they all had in common a stalwart strength. Star was irrevocably bonded to Ellesandra in her mind and heart. And through that unwavering desire came a surge of potential, which pushed into Ellesandra's heart and tore through whatever barriers Ellesandra might try to put up before it and expose the core of Ellesandra's desires, stripped free of fears, of doubts, of repression and denial. The overwhelming calm kept any of this emotion from overflowing, of battering Ellesandra's mind or heart. It allowed her, in this moment, in this trance, to simply...Look into themselves and feel Star's open heart and be challenged with how much they accepted Star, and how much they could be vulnerable to her in turn if they lived in this perfect world of flowers and peace where nothing else mattered. The real-world complications still existed, far above in the conscious world. This would not change anything. It simply stripped away all that stood in the way to make each woman as vulnerable as possible to one another so their barest selves could experience each other and temper the chains of their bond to empower it to new heights.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

At first, Ellesandra was frustrated at her inability to control her emotions. But then all of that just seemed to...go away. She felt the calm slide in, felt the pulse from before and she glanced at Star, just to make sure she was okay and there wasn't a repeat of what happened before. And then the heartbeat. A soft wince was given as she felt it being off beat with her own, kind of like a soreness or pain in the chest, and her free hand came up to cover her chest in feeling that. As the hearts synchronized and began to beat as one, though, she looked back at Star. Felt her goodness, her positive influence, her calmness, and even without the influence of this realm on her, those feelings for Star began to burn brighter, stronger. They alone wouldn't have been enough to burn away the darkness, the fears and doubts surrounding them, but in the combination of Star's calmness, of seeing - no, feeling - Star's desire for her both as a lover and as a companion, she wanted that. She might deny it, might deny to herself that it was needed, but deep down, she did. The desire that was reflected back to Star, Ellesandra's own, was a bit different from Star's. While Star did have a focus on fantasizing about them together, Ellesandra's desire didn't really focus around that. Oh, she was physically attracted to Star, aroused by her and the idea of being intimate with her, but to Ellesandra that physical, lust focused idea wasn't new. It wasn't something that she focused on as a goal or desire with Star. What was, though, was the intimacy that came along with it. The brief flash Star might get of the idea Ellesandra had for them intimate was Star arching or in the throes of an orgasm, but then it was just...closeness. Being held by Star, just touching one another, feeling that protection and love no matter what. Feeling that Star would be by her side through anything. The emotional intimacy was what Ellesandra wasn't used to, and what she craved - even if she'd never verbalize that or admit it to herself. The idea of them sitting together every night under a field of stars, cuddling up. Maybe with a dog, potentially even a child. These were the desires she wouldn't admit to herself for Star - a life with her. Physical intimacy, sex - Ellesandra was numb to that, could get it with a lot of women, HAD gotten it with other women. But the emotional connection between them, that's what Ellesandra craved. She'd fucked plenty before, but she hadn't ever made love. Without the fears and the doubts, the self-hate swirling around these feelings and desires, they swelled, grew. They were obvious, any ability to block them not one that Ellesandra possessed. And she...didn't know what to do. The odd thing was, it was the first time she was truly letting herself feel them, too. Truly letting herself realize she desired not only just intimacy with Star, but a life with her. She was stunned, letting the combinations of their feelings swirl around them like that.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The true realization of this bond, the acceptance of it - even if that acceptance would be contended by all the fears and doubts of reality once removed from the trance - was the source of power that this moment sought. That intimacy, that flowering affection, that solidarity, the essence of their bond. It was tapped into, bursting forth from Ellesandra's chest to meet Star's own acceptance of it that saw not a single point of resistance. Star had always accepted all that Ellesandra felt, of course, so it came as little surprise. But with it burgeoning out of Ellesandra, the resonance was tempered. The white line between them grew brighter than it had been, strengthening and empowering from their bond. And as it grew, so too did that sensation of power. In that moment, Ellesandra was made to feel invincible. Every good feeling, every hope, every source of determination within Ellesandra's heart flourished and blossomed anew, bringing with it the strength and conviction to face any foe, any challenge, any threat. There might not be a specific word that embodied their bond, but the sensation fit it. Whether it was closer to two lovers defending one another or two friends or comrades in arms or some combination of it or something entirely different, Ellesandra felt their place cement in Star's heart...And hers cement in Ellesandra's. Every desire to have Star by her side through anything was, in that moment, realized. Her heart called out, wordlessly, asking: 'will you always be with me, Star?', and Star's heart answered, equally in sensation without words: 'always, Ellesandra'. A firm reassurance of her unwavering conviction. And with that, the world around them faded to white, and Ellesandra woke up again. Normal feelings returned. The foray into their inner self had a great deal of focus on one particular part of themselves, so it might come with some measure of emotional whiplash when everything else came back. Reality was still real, after all. The influence of this meditative trance was no longer forcing the doubts and fears away from Ellesandra's heart, nor forcing away the grief and guilt they felt. Star, too, felt this snap back to reality. Her face was bright red, and she kept one hand holding onto Ellesandra's arm, though the other snapped to her own heart, clutching it as she panted. The connection between them allowed Ellesandra to feel that Star was fine. She was okay. Just momentarily overwhelmed, and now needing to process all of...That. Just the same as Ellesandra would need to. But in the wake of it all? A fragment of that invincible feeling remained. That connection with Star remained. Her aura, just her presence, had an empowering effect on Ellesandra, and the faintest, tiniest, most miniscule healing tingle could be felt in their right shoulder.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The feeling of the bond strengthening, the bursting forth of their resonance...it was so strange. Yet, Ellesandra felt like it was right. Like doing this was the right thing to do, like connecting with Star was good. And then the feeling of being invincible overcame her. She wanted to run and fight Black Diamond right then and there. Of course, she didn't. She just felt good, for the first time in ages. If pressed to come up with the last time she'd felt this good, she wouldn't be able to give you a specific time it had been so long. The mixture of their desires, feeling Stars desire for her, her affection, cement in her heart, also made her heart skip a beat - if it could right now. A blush would move to her cheeks in the real world and she felt...nervous. Shy, even through the reassurance of Star's conviction. Their connection. And then the trance was broken, white light filling her sight before fading to being back in the room with Star. And then those doubts hit. Her heart, which had swelled with desire and affection as well as Star's returned affection, immediately ached for that same feeling. That assuredness, that knowledge that things would be okay together. Instead, it got the pain of fear. The realization that she'd shared way more than she'd expected would happen during this, that Stars face was bright red because she knew how much Ellesandra just wanted, needed, someone to just...be there. By her side. Holding her. And the self doubt hit. Ellesandra pulled her hand away from Star's remaining arm and moved backwards, both physically and emotionally retreating from Star again. Those barriers came back down, the words - 'You'll just hurt or kill her, Ellesandra' repeating in her mind. He moved to the other end of the bed and pressed herself down into the bed, head lowered and staring at her lap, with her hands wringing there. "Sorry I - uh. Sorry." What was she even sorry for? If pressed, she didn't know how to respond. She was just sorry for sharing something that she didn't feel like she could act on. That she was burdening Star with her emotions, her feelings, when all they would do is end up hurting or getting Star killed. Just like they had with Marigold.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had worried the emotional whiplash would do this to Ellesandra, so she was quick to follow Ellesandra as they retreated, crawling on the bed to land a firm hand on their shoulder. She looked at them, sure, and firm. Sure, she was still blushing. But she was, more than that, determined. "No." A single word, but it was about as staunch and firm as the gentle aurmancer could muster. "I won't hear it. That was all...A beautiful moment," she said, tears welling in the corners of her eyes. "And I won't hear you apologize. I already told you...Nothing is going to change just because we feel something. It's what we do with those emotions that decides what path we walk. And I know that you're still scared. I'm not scared, Ellesandra. But...I know you are. So just take a moment...Breathe with me. Find your center again. I'm here for you." Star's hand on Ellesandra's shoulder evoked a...Stronger response than it previously could have. Their bond had deepened. And though it was but a quiet echo, there was a remnant of that invincible feeling. That reassurance echoing in Ellesandra's heart, that Star was being sincere. That she was going to be there. Ellesandra had accepted Star, and Star had accepted Ellesandra in kind. There was trust. There was belief. There was conviction in Star with this newfound, deeper bond. "It's okay, if you need to cry, or if you need to be held. I'm here. I'm right here."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra flinched when Star followed her and touched her arm. It wasn't a flinch from someone who expected Star to do them harm, but it was the flinch of someone who was afraid of Star getting too close, emotionally. Of the feelings she had right now hurting Star, remembering how Star had emotionally exploded the last time Ellesandra had shoved her feelings for the auramancer down. Star persisted though, and tried to reassure her. Her jaw muscles were clenched with the strength to bite through steel, it felt like, as she looked away from Star, not letting Star meet her eyes. She didn't cry, but even as Star soothed her with the touch, the little bit of reassurance there, a small hint at that invincibility in the touch, the negative emotions and darkness swirled. She took long, deep breaths, trying to center herself like Star said. To push them back down. Not to feel them, but to bundle them up and push them down where they'd risen from the whiplash. To bundle them around her emotional feelings for Star, and once again shroud them, trying to pretend they didn't exist. It was futile; at this point, those feelings and that desire burned bright enough to be seen even through the shadow, even if dimmer. But the attempt was still made to ignore it, to pretend it didn't exist so that she didn't have to live with those insecurities in her mind constantly. "I need to - to shower." She said. She hadn't showered earlier, letting Star do it, and normally she waited until morning to shower. But with the way today had gone? Maybe she needed another shower to help process some of it. She stood, as long as Star didn't stop her, and headed into the attached bathroom. She didn't bring new clothes, since she'd just changed into these ones and would just use them instead. And if Star didn't stop her, she'd keep the water right on the edge of too hot. The water wouldn't scald her or leave any permanent damage, but it was....uncomfortable.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't stop them. She needed to let Ellesandra have the comfort that fit them, not the one she thought was best. Within reason, of course. Self destructive habits were still a sure-fire way to make for one angry auramancer. But as Ellesandra got up, she grasped their hand with hers. A momentary, parting squeeze. A gesture she'd done before, last time Ellesandra had used a shower to try and reset. "...Warm water," she said quietly. And if Ellesandra didn't listen and still produced the discomfort with the heat of the water, there would be a gentle knock on the door. She doubted she had to do more than knock to make it clear she knew what the knight was doing. Even if Ellesandra got mad at her for hounding them over it, she wasn't going to permit the knight to inflict this sort of torture upon themselves. She took a cold shower earlier, of course. She needed to, because otherwise she was gonna start interpreting a lot of what Ellesandra said in horny ways, but it was reasonable cold. Just cold. Not freezing. Not uncomfortable. Just a little chill to splash on her face and cool her off. What the knight was doing was beyond that, and she wasn't going to stand for it, if they still insisted on doing it.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra paused when Star told her to use warm water. She frowned, and there was no hiding that she had fully intended to make it uncomfortable on herself. But she didn't say anything when she headed into the shower, and the change was that the water was hot, but instead of being on the line of painful/uncomfortable, it was on the line of uncomfortable/normal. Just hotter than most people would do, but hopefully not hot enough to get Star upset at her. It didn't help, not nearly as much as the discomfort helped distract her from the swirling darkness inside, but the water was still cleansing nonetheless. She closed her eyes and let her head rest against the shower, water just rolling down her, and then she reached over to her right shoulder. The arm where she'd felt Star, intentionally or unintentionally, healing her just a little bit each time they got close. Between Stars emotional outburst and then that resonance just now, she wasn't sure how much had healed - but she could tell some had. And the idea of that disturbed her. On one hand, it made sense to get it healed, to be back to her full martial strength. Oh it wouldn't be full, she'd need to work her right arm up from it's physically weakened state now, but it would be a step in the right direction. On the other hand, there was a large part of Ellesandra who felt like she deserved to have that injury. Deserved to have that pain when she overused it. It was a reminder of how she got it, why she got it. It was a reminder of the day she'd seen Marigold be killed. A reminder of how she'd used Marigold's own rapier to stab the man who did it through the eye. A reminder of her mistakes. With a few deep breaths, trying to push those feelings back down, push down the distrust of Star healing her, push down the doubt still swirling, she came out of the shower dressed and with a towel wrapped around her head to take care of her hair. She glanced at Star briefly, but then turned her gaze away again. "I...I don't know if I can do that again." She said, keeping her gaze turned away while walking to the opposite bed from what Star was in, trying to create some distance.

Star was mindful of the other woman's state in the shower, but she couldn't really be mad about just taking a normal hot shower. Just like she couldn't be made to feel bad for needing a normal cold shower. It had its therapeutic uses, as long as it wasn't hurting the person taking it, or edging too close. Water was soothing. Pain was self-abuse. So she settled on her bed, and elected to look at the journal that had been left on it. She hadn't started reading it by the time Ellesandra came back out, and was just examining it. When the knight emerged and professed they were having doubts, Star met them with a soft nod. "It's okay if you can't," she said, keeping her voice gentle. "But...Don't go deciding it on a whim. Please just trust me when I say emotions that strong need time to settle. Even for me. I'll need some time before I try that again myself, if we do. No firm decision either way just yet, okay?" she said with a smile. It was perhaps surprising that even Star herself was saying 'hey this emotional stuff might be too much for me', but it certainly ought to help Ellesandra feel more justified in how jarring it was for them. In truth, Star wasn't deterred, as she found the whole thing beautiful. But the problem was, then, that it was so beautiful to her that it dropped a powder keg onto her feelings for Ellesandra. And as much as she insisted she was okay even if Ellesandra never returned her feelings, that was only true if she didn't actually fall in love with them. If she just...Indulged these feelings with reckless abandon, it was possible she'd push too hard out of her own desire, pushing Ellesandra into an unhealthy emotional state that might fracture their bond. She needed to pause and assess before she could continue. She recalled how Ellesandra felt in that memory, standing next to Marigold. The nervousness. The dry throat. The way her heart ached. She was feeling her own version of that steadily blossoming in her heart. Their time in Myst had resulted in a lot of fanning of that fire. There was no telling what would happen once they were back on the road. Would their mission take too much focus, leaving their bond to wither and die? Or would crisis evoke the depths of it and set it ablaze? If only she could see the future..


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She hadn't expected Star to tell her it was okay if she couldn't. That had been...the last thing she'd expected. She glanced at Star out of the corner of her eye, but then back down. She listened to what Star said, but didn't respond. Her lack of response was an acceptance, in this situation though. It wasn't her saying 'no it won't happen again.' It was leaving it open to see, in the future. She moved to lay back down on the bed and then turned, atop the covers, with her back to Star and pulled her knees up. The self-comforting position she'd taken enough that Star would recognize it, her fetal position one in which she wanted to just hold herself. "We should go to bed. Early day tomorrow." She said this, but even just looking at her aura Star would be able to tell Ellesandra was going to have troubles sleeping that evening. It was a way to shut down the conversation though, to stop it and push Star into sleeping so that Ellesandra didn't have to worry about her hearing when she did end up crying. And she probably would, eventually.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star might feel the need to give Ellesandra distance to process things at their own pace. But it wasn't like her auramancy deactivated overnight, nor did her feelings for the woman vanish while the knight was in the shower. She paused for a moment before considering what she was going to ask, but did ask it. She wasn't going to back down from at least trying to fight Ellesandra's cold, distant tendencies, even if she couldn't force herself on them. "...I'd really like it if we slept in the same bed. If I could hold you tonight. Nothing but just...Cuddling. Promise. But I'm not sure if you feel it too but...Being separate after what we just did feels a little...Weird. Wrong...Achy...It'll help me sleep much better if we could." All of this was true. She hoped it would be helpful to Ellesandra too, of course. But she had certainly noticed that the knight was more likely to accept these things if it was about her than about them.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Star was right on the money. If Star had phrased that in any way that would have been to help Ellesandra, it would have been flat out refused. Her phrasing it as needing it herself, though? Ellesandra didn't answer at first, debating with herself. There was part of her that did, indeed, want Star holding her. That part was being conflicted with the need for distance, to keep Star away. She busied herself by removing the towel from her hair and tossing it randomly near the bathroom, damp hair now resting down along her back as she continued to lie there. "Okay." She said, finally. She'd only agreed because she was afraid Star needed it because Ellesandra was pushing her away. A lie she told herself that she'd continue to do, even with Star holding her. Even if she knew that Star holding her would potentially make her break down faster, harder. She didn't know how to handle herself right now, though, and if Star holding her would make it better? Well, who was she to refuse something Star wanted to do to make herself feel better too?


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star donned a soft smile and set the journal on the side table as she slowly eased out of her bed and over onto Ellesandra's. She carefully moved into the bed behind them, pulling the blanket over the pair of them as she moved to spoon them. She pulled them against her, her front to their back, and let her calming presence wash over them. Their bond was noticeably stronger. Her influence, that much stronger. Of course there was nothing she could do to stop Ellesandra from breaking down and crying if they needed it. But she was there. A calming, reassuring presence that whispered to Ellesandra's heart, saying everything was going to work out. Something that took the edge off the pain, even if it still needed to be felt. That, combined with the general comforts that physical touch provided, was all Star could do for the conscious knight. Truly, it did bring about an ease in the ache she felt in her heart, being able to hold Ellesandra. She firmly kept herself from indulging romantic thoughts in the moment. That was still...Off limits. But she could enjoy it, and be comforted by it, all the same. Sleep was very much needed - it hadn't been a lie that they had an early day the next day. But even as Star drifted off, she remained connected to Ellesandra. If they were crying, if they were tormented by their heart, she would wake again and pull them more flush against her while whispering sweet nothings to them to give what comforts she could. And assuming Ellesandra did at some point sleep, Star was the valiant bastion warding their heart against encroaching nightmares. She wouldn't allow that. She would not allow Ellesandra's mind to torment them, and her influence, unconscious as it was, would ensure that Ellesandra had positive dreams. Emotional ones? Maybe, maybe not. But good ones, all the same.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra, at first, just let Star hold her. She enjoyed the comfort it gave, even if she would never say that. Eventually, probably after Star had drifted off to sleep the first time, she'd begun crying. It wasn't loud, it wasn't sobbing. She didn't even jerk with crying motions or anything. There were just...tears. At the pain, the fear, the strength of it all combined with the absolute bliss and ideal feelings she'd had when in the trance. The recognition of what she truly, deep down, wanted. To be loved, to have a wife, a kid - a peaceful existence. All things she'd never let herself admit before, all things that seemed completely out of reach for her. Who would love someone like her, so guarded and so...broken? When those feelings had been held back, being able to recognize those desires, that need and want was easy. With those feelings here, it just felt like someone had waved a potential good life in front of her, and then slammed into place all of the reasons that it couldn't happen. Even if Star did wake up and from the silent tears, from the pain that Ellesandra felt at the realization, or belief, that those things couldn't happen for her, she just stayed there. She tucked her chin down to her chest as if to hide her tears, hide her face from Star, and continued. Eventually, she would literally cry herself to sleep. Star's presence there was the only reason her dreams did not go awry. They wanted to. Star might even feel it - or whatever presence or comfort that supported Ellesandra would at least. The tug to take a dream that had started with her spending a day with Marigold into Marigold getting split in two by an axe - not even how she died, but more gruesome and so her mind had summoned it as an hyperbole. Or how that dead Marigold would have changed into Star and Ellesandra would have been crying over a dead Star instead of Marigold. Those things just...didn't happen in the dream. The pleasant dream continued, maybe not a great happy dream but not a nightmare either. And like the last time Star had influenced her dreams this way, Ellesandra would wake in the morning feeling...a lot more refreshed than she normally did when sleeping.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It was one place that Star certainly had strength enough to affect actual change on emotional matters. Dreams. Reflections of the unconscious mind. Of course, Star was no Sapphire or Black Diamond or magical reality-bending tarot card. She wasn't going to be able to stop any of that. But when nightmares came knocking, Star had her brief moment to shine and banish them. No gruesome sights. Just happier times. A reflection instead of the easier life Ellesandra longed for. A calm life. A peaceful one. That was something Ellesandra's mind could construct, fill in the details however it wished. Let them live that fantasy a while before waking up, properly refreshed. The waking world was painful enough, after all. Star had awoken when Ellesandra cried, soothed them as best she could before they cried themselves to sleep again. She naturally felt the emotional response, the feeling of loss, of grief in the face of what could be versus what was. A feeling that hit Star, too. Feeling Ellesandra's raw affection for her, it still echoed in her heart. The potential for them to be so emotionally intertwined. To be so fulfilled by each other. To not be able to have that...She could understand, certainly, that feeling of loss of what could be. But once more, she reminded herself. It would get worse, before it got better. She held hope that, even if she and Ellesandra did not become lovers, that she would see Ellesandra smiling, genuinely, and free from the thousands of tons of rubble that kept her heart so buried. For what ever could someone want more for someone they had romantic adoration for, than to see them happy? Even if not with them...Their happiness remained her desire. These things were all swirling in her mind as the knock at the door roused her from sleep. "Wake up sleepyheads, time to go!" said Amelia through the door. "Get your butts up and get food in you, we're burning daylight!"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She woke up, having turned at some point in the night to embrace Star back. Her arms had slid around Star's waist and she'd buried her face into Star's chest, holding onto her as she'd dreamt. When she awoke to the sound of Amelia knocking on the door, she rose her head swiftly, checking for danger. It was a habit, to check real quick when woken by something. Nothing was around, but she was holding closely onto Star, cuddling much more intimately than she normally would have been in her waking world. She gingerly extracted herself from Star and slid to the side of the bed, only glancing at Star once to ensure she was up before moving to stand. "We're up Miss Young Whippersnapper. Get off our lawns." Ellesandra had slept better than she normally did, but that didn't get rid of the training she had to wake up quickly. She didn't even seem super drowsy as she moved to begin putting armor on and collecting all their gear, putting the card in a pocket directly on her rather than in their pack, and so forth. She tried not to look at Star, feeling...embarrassment at how she'd woken up, and some of the things she'd dreamt about. Things she was certain she'd never have, but the dream of living out a life with Star in some cottage surrounded by fields of flowers, a dog and two kids...it had been a nice dream. A dream she would never admit to having.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

A dream Star similarly would have no way of knowing that Ellesandra had. But good emotions through it were hers to unconsciously feel, so Star woke up feeling good. Albeit a bit red in the face for some reason, but she didn't comment, just smiled at Ellesandra and began getting ready herself. Morning rituals done swiftly, trying (and not really succeeding) to keep up with Ellesandra's pace. She gathered up all the books they had, which were clearly not as needed as they thought they would be coming into Myst, and set about changing into her magical outfit again. She might need it. "Uh huh, get right on that grandma, captain expects us out at the gate in thirty, so put your cane into overdrive, would'ya?" Amelia called back, followed by the sounds of receding footsteps. Amelia was waiting by the entrance to the guild hall. Food was quick; they were up early enough to beat the morning rush and be first in line, and swiftly able to get some food into them. The books were taken with Amelia to the service desk to be returned, something that was of vital importance in Myst, before the group was ready to head off. It would likely be a good reprieve for Ellesandra. No emotions. Just task after task after task, completing things in an efficient manner to get to their assigned objective. Star was able to keep up, though she very obviously was not used to the military life, and even something as simple as just eating swiftly to get on with it was not normal for her. She enjoyed savouring the small pleasures in life, after all. But unless Ellesandra had any specific detour or other business, they were heading straight for the gate. Nothing to be left behind. They could be gone from Myst for a long time, or they could be back the very same night. But until they knew, they had to prepare for the long haul, ultimately culminating in them departing from the main city of Myst to one of its many 'clock hands' that extended out into the cloudy abyss, whereupon they were faced with a large portal that Amelia had to set about attuning, a process which would take a short while. Long enough for them to be greeted by Amara, who was already there standing watch in wait for the others. It was barely past dawn, so for Amara to beat them here by this much, the captain must have risen before the sun was even cresting the horizon.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra went about their morning rituals with the efficiency and speed of someone used to packing up and being ready to leave quickly. She even stopped to help Star if she needed help with anything, though she was careful not to do so in a way that would imply Star was being too slow or holding them up or anything like that. Food was eaten and she gave Amelia a 'respect your elders' talk in an old granny tone while Star finished. Keeping up the comraderie, distracting herself from the emotional whirlstorm that was her once again realizing that her dream was just that - a dream, and not obtainable. Unlike the night before, she had something to do now though. That something being getting everything ready and leaving Myst. When they dropped the books off at the circulation desk, she was sure to thank Serenity if she was there. Other than that, she didn't head on any detours while going to the portal, and would nod respectfully to Amara, but as they waited for the portal to be attuned she would look over to Star. Her hand came out, gauntleted or not, and just lightly touched the side of Star's hand. Not holding hands, but a brief touch to show support. "You nervous?" This was the first time Star would be returning to her home plane since she was sent away. And she had confirmation that her mother had been captured. No one could know for certain what awaited them on the other side, but trouble was certainly going to be part of it. Not to mention they knew that Black Diamond was going to come for them sooner or later, whether that was right when they got there or later.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile and a little half-shrug with her shoulder at the question. "A little. But not because I'm going home. More just the uncertainty of what's waiting for us. Trying to be optimistic," she said, shooting one more smile at her companion. She appreciated the little physical bump. That she responded well to physical affection was something Ellesandra had clearly come to understand at this point, and it made Star happy. She briefly adjusted her ponytail as Amelia finished what she was doing. The portal then activated, a swirling mass of mana that was ready to transport them. Some brief discussion followed with Star and Amelia fine-tuning the location. Their destination had been agreed to be nearby Hotenz city, which was apparently on the star plane of Gurhal. Their ultimate goal was the moon plane, but the intention was to establish themselves and get a place they could come back to if needed, some place safe that had lots of work to do if they needed. With it all done, the only thing left to do was step through it. Star paused at the portal, assuming Ellesandra and Amara were going to take the lead, though if Ellesandra let her, she preferred to hold onto Ellesandra's hand as they moved through it. And once they did, in whatever order, the group of four found themselves in the midst of a sunny, rolling, grassy plain. A large hill that rose up and created a plateau was visible to the north-east, with some forest to the south, and a large body of water to the north-west. The immediate moments after teleporting in were ones of calm. No immediate threats to be seen. But the good news didn't last long, for Star frowned as she looked around. Amelia, too, looked like something wasn't right. "This is...The sun plane," said Star. Amelia then added: "This isn't right. This isn't where the portal was attuned." Hearing that, Amara pulled her spear off her back. "You don't make mistakes like that, Amelia. Tell me you were just slacking off or something," said Amara, the caution clear in her voice. Amelia shook her head. "No, something interfered." And that something made itself clear, for the shadow-sense that Ellesandra had immediately spiked as not one, not two, but three sources of the shadow-essence came zipping towards them at lightning-speed. Two portals opened, one to the north-east, one to the north-west. Out of the north-east portal stepped the familiar suited man with green hair who had summoned the armor that tried to kill the group. Out of the north-west portal was a tall, scantily clad woman with short, black hair that wielded a scythe. And the third presence Ellesandra felt? It was behind, to the south, but there was no portal, and no actual person to be seen. Just a presence. An invisible one. Naturally, given what Star had revealed to Ellesandra, it would come as no surprise that she took a moment to lean over and whisper to Ellesandra. "There's a third one behind us. It has the same sort of aura. It's one of them," she said, though it would be something Ellesandra already knew. So it seemed that Star didn't really know about Ellesandra's shadow-sense. "All right, no jokes this time," said Blood Emerald. "You fucked up. Big time, Ellesandra. And before any of you do something stupid, we're calling a truce." There was a seriousness in the voice of the man who had been nothing but jokes the last he had been seen. "My associate Blood Onyx here," he said, gesturing to the other woman. "And I...Would prefer to not turn your first five seconds in Gurhal into a bloodbath, buuuut...That's up to you all. No. Getting straight to the point? The big boss has requested an audience with you, Ellesandra. In person. Alone."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had nodded at Star's words. They made sense, though she knew she herself would be nervous if she were returning 'home'. Then again, she had very different reasons to be nervous. When it came time to enter, Ellesandra had strongly considered holding Star while going through, just in case something happened while doing so, but she decided to go forward with Amara for the more likely danger of there being something waiting on the other side. This was accurate, if not an immediate thing right when they stepped through. The portal closed behind them and Ellesandra was looking around, curious at the strange landscape. This wasn't what she'd expected, but when it was confirmed that this wasn't Gurhal...Ellesandra immediately drew her Rapier. "Incoming." She'd said as soon as she felt the three shadows coming. She didn't need Star whispering to her that there was a third, but it was appreciated nonetheless. She positioned herself next to Star, in a position where she could keep an eye in the direction of the one behind them without making it obvious she knew they were there. As the Blood Emerald spoke though, she shook her head to him. "Tell Die they can go fuck off and visit me in my dreams like they were doing before we went to Myst, if they really want to talk to me. Or are they unable to do so in Gurhal as well? Not that that seems to be where we are." Ellesandra was in a defensive posture. She did not think they could take all three of these people with just them, even with Amara and Amelia's help. If the choices ended up being they fight or she went, she'd go. But she was going to offer at least for them to get the hell away and to talk to Black Diamond in her sleep, at least. That seemed a safer option for all of them, as well as a way for her to tell Blood Emerald no - which was more satisfying than she'd ever actually admit.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The shadow-sense that Ellesandra had made the answer quite obvious. The gems where were their hearts should be. The third, invisible gemstone was one that resonated with the same energy that Black Diamond had introduced as Red Opal. Amara and Amelia took up defensive postures complimenting Ellesandra, putting Star pretty smack-dab in the middle. The three enemies had formed a triangular formation around them. A wide berth was between them. Of course, with the speed they arrived, it was unlikely running was an option. "This is Gurhal," corrected Amelia. "Just...Not the right part of it. Not where I was aiming," she said, though her words were curt and transactional. No attitude. Just passing information, fully in fight mode. "We're not going to argue with you, Ellesandra. If what was necessary was possible through existing channels, we wouldn't be here. You'll put your rapier away now and step into this portal or for every two minutes that pass that you haven't, I kill one of your friends," said Blood Onyx, speaking with a fierce authority that was...Vaguely reminiscent of how Sia might speak, if Sia was a murderous psychopath. Blood Emerald kept his arms folded after flicking one hand to the space between himself and Blood Onyx, which opened a portal for Ellesandra to walk through. "What's the play here, soldier?" asked Amara, clearly ready to fight if they called for it, suicidal as that might be. But she clearly didn't like the idea of just...Giving up the knight to the enemy. "Come along now, and nobody has to get hurt. We'll leave your friends alone as soon as you step through," said Blood Emerald. "And assuming you refrain from fucking up this badly in the future, you can rest assured this truce will be a one time affair, but a truce, is a truce."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra turned to look at Blood Onyx when she spoke. While there was an initial response of attraction Star might see in Ellesandra - a recognition that she looked nice and had the intimidating presence that definitely drew Ellesandra's eye, there was absolutely no intention behind it. It was a base attraction, the type of attraction you felt when you saw a pretty lady on the street, but nothing more - especially for one of Black Diamond's servants. She didn't really see an option, here. She considered requesting that Star be allowed to come with her, just so Ellesandra could more easily protect her directly, but not only did she think that would be unlikely, that would set a bad example with Amara and Amelia for leaving them behind. If she didn't trust them to take care of Star, then she was also admitting that them staying there was dangerous. She pursed her lips, looking between Blood Onyx and Emerald. The acceptance came after a moment, noticeable in her emotion as she steeled herself for what was going to come ahead. She sheathed her rapier, reaching out to touch Star's arm in an attempt to reassure her. "I'll keep my rapier on me. I suspect Die could flick me across half the plane with a wave of their hand anyways, not like a needle prick will do anything to them hmm?" It was a forced compromise. She looked to Amara and indicated behind her. "And there's one back there too, Captain. If they attack, aim for their hearts - nothing else will do anything." She stepped forward, out of formation, and began walking straight for the portal, intent to get this done. If this was her death - well, it'd be her death. And, she wanted to slap Die around a little before she died for threatening Star, and her newfound companions. If it wasn't? Well, the chances of them holding to a truce were just barely a little higher than any of them getting out alive after a fight with all three of them.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was no motion from the servants of Black Diamond as Ellesandra moved into the portal. Star had nodded, but it would not take auramancy to see how worried she was. When Ellesandra stepped through, they found themselves standing in...A classroom? The grand shadow themselves was sitting on top of one of the desks, feet on the wooden chair before it. There were obvious paths to walk between the desks, but with Ellesandra walking into the room from the rear and the portal closing behind them, the likely result was the knight keeping their distance and leaning on the wall or something. The classroom also had no ceiling. Instead of a sky, there was a rushing flurry of red dust flying past. No sound was made as it did. It also could be seen out the left-hand windows. There was a door to leave the classroom, but opening that just revealed more void with dust. The shadow remained in place, but then, perhaps surprisingly...The shadow melted away, revealing the person, the woman, beneath. The Black Diamond had traits that were obviously opposite of Sapphire. Red eyes, black hair. A sense of gothic lolita fashion, from the black getup complete with thigh high stockings to the heavy boots, she was certainly had her sex appeal. Black Diamond looked at Ellesandra. Her expression was fairly...Neutral. "...My name is Valentina. Though you're free to continue to call my whatever you please," she said, not particularly caring what Ellesandra did on that matter. "And I've called you here because, it seems...You've cursed yourself. Something I'm sure comes as a surprise to you, given your talent for...Redirection, and magical resilience."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra walked through the portal and just...looked around. She had a very tight reign on what emotions she was letting show. There was concern mostly for Star that was being held down, not letting herself focus on it. If she did, she might panic at the idea of them killing Star while she wasn't there. She took a moment to look around the room, seeing the shadowy figure on one of the desks, and after only a second of consideration she began walking directly towards the shadow. She didn't seem hostile, her hand not trailing near her rapier or anything at all. She walked right up to the desk, even as the shadow went away and Valentina showed herself. Ellesandra looked her up and down, raising an eyebrow. "I expected something a little more." She said, completely ignoring what Valentina had actually said. She gave a glance around the desks, then nodded. "Yeah, this one is nice. Excuse me." And she would sit down in the seat of the desk that Valentina was sitting on. If Valentina didn't move her feet, or stop Ellesandra from doing so, she'd just sit on her feet. Completely natural, stoic face, as if this was entirely normal when meeting an apparently really powerful being. She then looked up at Valentina, her face still void of the confusion Valentina's comment had wrought, or the concern she still had for Star. "So, cursed? I curse myself all the time, but I assume you mean a magical curse of some kind."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Unfortunately, Ellesandra's final words wouldn't have the chance to be spoken, for the moment they tried to sit on the chair occupied by Valentina's feet, Ellesandra just...Fell through the floor. Like it didn't even exist. And began to fall. And fall. And fall through an unending void of red particles that passed right through them. The void was the same in all directions, until it all turned black. The clouds of red particles could be seen overhead as Ellesandra descended into a truly black, lightless void, falling for the better part of a minute before the destination of their fall came into view. A bed of adamantine spikes as infinite as the void. Certain death. Alone, with nobody who could even know where Ellesandra even was, Ellesandra fell onto the spikes, impaled in a dozen different places and, for a single moment, experienced the excruciating pain of this impalement and their rapidly encroaching death. And then, they were back in the classroom. Standing at the back, where they had entered. Valentina still sat on the desk, where she had been, looking rather...Unfazed about whatever just happened to Ellesandra. Was it real? An illusion? A trick? Ellesandra could inspect themselves to see there was no injuries upon them. But what did just happen to them very much felt real. The pain felt real. Their adrenaline was certainly still spiked to its absolute maximum from the event. Valentina just...Looked at them. "As I was saying. You're cursed."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra began falling, and at first she looked around, trying to find something to grab onto to slow or stop her fall. "Shit." She muttered to herself as she just...kept falling. There was a brief moment of regretting her action; she'd been calling Valentina out on her not wanting to kill Ellesandra, or she would have already done so. Well, seemed like she was going to do so now. The thing was, there wasn't...panic, or absolute fear in Ellesandra like there would be in your average, mentally sane person. There was concern for what would happen to Star, a little bit of regret that she'd done that and pushed the situation to one where she wouldn't be able to protect Star any more. But there was an...acceptance that she would die. This is where the darkness in her calmed her - an acceptance that she'd finally be released from the emotional turmoil inside of her. Star had been very right to be concerned about it, since in this moment it was proving that Ellesandra was fully willing and able to just accept her death. When she saw the spikes, the only thing she did was curl up so that fewer would hit her. There was no chance of not getting hit and dying, she knew this. But she could limit how skewered she was, in case Valentina threw her body back to Star, tried to torment or scar her with it. She could also try to insure death came quickly, and she didn't just bleed out on the spikes. The pain that went through her caused her to cry out and eyes close, clenching against what had been known to be coming, but even knowing didn't mean you could really prepare for it. She coughed up blood and then - suddenly, she was back in the classroom. Ellesandra blinked in confusion, looking around and patting at her body. No holes in the armor where the spikes went through. No pain, anymore anyways. She remembered the pain - that much pain didn't just go away, so even if she wasn't actively feeling the pain it still felt...tingly. Like her brain was expecting the pain, even if it wasn't there. Surprisingly there was...relief. She was still here, still able to help Star. That was the main reason there wasn't disappointment at still being alive. Taking a deep breath, she took a seat at one of the desks in the back. She'd learned her lesson; Valentina wouldn't be fucked with. "Yeah, well." Her voice came out raspier than it would have before. A little bit from the shock and scream of being impaled, though more psychological than physical since she wasn't sure her physical form had actually been hurt at all during that...vision or whatever. She considered telling Valentina that being stalked by her and her minions was a curse, but she held her tongue. No need to antagonize the woman more. "I might need some more details than that."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina gave a soft nod. "That's why you're here," she said, looking...Saddened. Not that she expected Ellesandra to have sympathy. But it did seem that even this evil woman wasn't immune to the emotion. "Have you ever.." she paused. "...Considered something, some...Punishment, perhaps...To be something you would not only not wish on your worst enemy, but something you would actively help them out of?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked...confused. She frowned, squinting her eyes at Valentina, then looking around as if looking for Ashton Kutcher and camera crews - not that she knew what any of that would mean. She just felt like she was being pranked somehow. "Yes, but as flattered as I am that you'd consider me your worst enemy, I don't know if I can truly claim that title. Sapphic might prefer it." A pause, then adding. "So what am I cursed with?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina gently nodded to the answer. "You aren't my worst enemy, so don't feel the need to be flattered. Sapphire isn't, either. She's just my most powerful enemy." She then paused again to think on how to answer the question. "You're cursed with...The same thing I am cursed with. I don't know that it has a name. I wouldn't give it the affection of naming it. But recall what happened when you stole the mana from within that suit of armor. That brief flash you had into different lives...That was real. They were real. Real people, actively, at the time you saw them, suffering through what you saw. You didn't...Take over their bodies or anything. The curse just...Forced you to relive their experiences. And if left alone, it will do this to you again. And again. And again. Until it is constant. Until it never stops. And only ever gets worse. Until you are feeling...All of it. Everything everyone everywhere, in every plane of existence, all of their suffering. Never any of their joy, or happiness, or anything of the sort. Only their darkest moments. Only their deepest fears. Only every dark and broken and twisted part of humanity until you can no longer resist the urge to take your own life." She looked at Ellesandra, eyes steel with a firm seriousness. "And when you do, it won't let you. Trust me....I've tried every way you can imagine. But you don't deserve that. You don't deserve a lot of the things you've experienced...Being the maid of honour to the woman you love and standing there as they say 'I do' to someone else in particular hits pretty close to home for me. Can't say I expected someone else to have gone through that, and it was pretty shortly after it happened to me, too," she said, donning a sad grin and shaking her head. "Been a while since something rubbed the salt in my wounds that hard. Not that it was your fault, obviously. But if there is one exceptionally unique experience out there where I can say I know how it feels, well...That's it." She paused, collecting herself again. "...So. We can go back to business as usual after all this. Go back to...You making up really bad nicknames for me, being a general shithead, me trying very hard to persuade you and Star to stop what you're doing without actually killing you if I can help it...But that all takes a backseat when this curse is festering in you. So I need to remove it from you."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked...disturbed at what Valentina said. Did Valentina already know that, or was she some damn deity just watching Ellesandra and Star? Her arms crossed and she squeezed, resisting the temptation to be more of a shit head in rebellion to this super powerful being taking an interest in her life. "So, you a voyeur or something, watching my conversations with Star? And what do you mean cursed for seeing that? That was my own idiotic fault for trying to draw the magic of the armored knight into myself, the memories of whatever it had with it. Did that curse me, or are you saying that my magical...abilities are my curse? I am certainly no auramancer and what you're describing sounds like the negative bits of auramancy." She was confused still, not entirely sure what exactly the 'curse' was, and a little distracted by how much Valentina knew about her. She hated that, and the reminder of Marigold. And that damned Prince.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina shook her head. "I'd much rather butt out of everyone's business. But every time you suffer, be it a physical wound, be it emotional turmoil, which for you is fairly constant, it is felt by me, as well. I live the experience as if I was you. But I'm also simultaneously doing so for...Everyone who is suffering, all the time. It takes a backseat to my consciousness; the whole trance phase of it was only the first...two hours of it once it took me over. As for watching your conversations? No. In particular, whatever went on in Myst is.." She gently shrugged. "One of those places I couldn't spy on if I wanted to. And there's been times I wanted to, certainly. But no, the curse was in the mana. You took it from the armored knight. The curse...Stuck to you. It shouldn't have, by all accounts. Between your magical resistance and the general structure of it, it shouldn't have stuck to you. But it did. It's inside you now. Weak, below your notice more than likely. It would have not power while in Myst, as well. But if you ignore it, well. It will eventually consume you, as it has me. Magical empathy isn't unique to auramancers, though they are certainly the most adept at it, and being able to 'see' emotion is certainly unique to them. But if it simplifies it for you, sure. Think of it like if Star was only ever able to see one thing: Suffering, in whatever shape it took. Pain, rejection, fear, terror, disease, hunger...Pick your poison. Including literal poison. And then expand that to...Everyone. Every living person. That is what the curse is. The curse I thought I could fix but...Instead just got stuck with myself."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She took this information in. And then she sighed and hung her head back off the back of the chair, staring up into the red swirling dust above that formed the 'ceiling' of this classroom. "Cool, that's a lovely little existence. Maybe I'd be a bitch too if I had to live with that forever and couldn't just off myself. How fucking lucky of me." She reached up, pressing the palm of her hand into her right eye and pressing in a little to fight off the stress headache that was forming. "So, the options to get rid of it? Since you said apparently the all powerful demon goddess of yourself couldn't fix it." Ellesandra was...tired. Exhausted. She didn't want this. The idea of not being able to end herself when feeling the suffering of every person in the world was...ugh. She had times where she actively wanted to end herself with just her own suffering, let alone feeling others. "I'm assuming this isn't something that a powerful cleric or paladin by the name of Amara could just wave her hand and fix no?" Or Star, she didn't know what kind of restoration spells Star might have other than cure wounds, but she was hesitant to let Star touch this curse with her auramancy anyways.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina gave a sad smile at Ellesandra's words. "I'm not a demon. Just a girl who was born with the gift of being...Really, really good at breaking curses, and had a mentor who helped foster that gift. A girl who believed in healing people. A girl who was subsequently killed for healing the wrong person, so said some fatass king. A girl who should have just died in the snow that day, but was saved by an angel. Then fell in love with that angel. And let that love make her...Try to fix the curse that angel had. Suck it right out of her necklace into another necklace I made, then destroy it. Only, well..." She paused. A small flash of red mana appeared around her neck. The necklace in question summoned into existence. The chain was black as night, jagged and frayed. Attached to the jagged metal were spikes, all pointing inwards towards Valentina's neck. The ring of spikes were spaced about an inch apart, and were all of different lengths such that the points of the jagged, blackened metal spikes all terminated about two inches away from Valentina's neck; looking at it, it seemed as though if one tried to take the necklace off over top of her head, the spikes would drive into her neck. The pendant for the necklace was, perhaps unsurprisingly, a gem equally as black as night inlaid into a blood-crimson setting. It reeked of vile, hateful magic, such that any magical senses Ellesandra had would feel active fear from its presence. "It's one of two curses I've never been able to break. And to be clear I can't break it on you, either. But I can take it back. Remove it from you, and merge it back into this necklace, where it should stay. And trust me...If Amara or Star or...Anyone in the whole multiverse was able to fix it...I'd be first in line. But as my luck would have it, the person who has the greatest knowledge and ability to fix it is...Me. I've looked, for over a thousand years now."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked back down at Valentina, eyeing the necklace, then tilting her head. An angel, huh? She pressed her lips together to consider if commenting on that was smart, and ultimately decided not to do so. "If the curse is in that necklace, you said you just brought it on yourself when pulling it from this angel. I'm assuming you, or I, wouldn't be able to just pull the curse from that necklace to another necklace then? When I was pulling magic from the armored knight I wasn't trying to redirect it, I was trying to fuel my own magic, but I don't think I've ever run into magic that I wasn't able to redirect." Even if it effected her for the time it would take her to redirect it - which did not sound like it would be fun. Still, Ellesandra doubted that would work anyways. Surely someone who seemed to be as old and powerful as Valentina would have tried something similar before; it sounded like that is exactly what she'd tried with this angel love of hers. She shook her head. "Sorry, I've got to assume you've tried something like that, not trying to womansplain-why am I apologizing to you? You just tortured me with spikes." A huff, crossing her arms. The idea of having this curse was not one she wanted, and if Valentina was offering to take it back, Ellesandra would take that. But there was part of her mind, at the very back, that knew...Star would be offering to help Valentina, if she could. If she had the ability Ellesandra had, to redirect magic and to draw it in on herself, to actually affect the flow of mana within a curse...she wouldn't just let Valentina take the curse back and then leave, even if Valentina was trying to kill her. Her teeth clenched and she waited on Valentina's answer, trying to hate the woman while at the same time truly considering if there was a way to help her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"You're right. I did that. So it's better you stop thinking about if you can help me. I don't deserve your mercy or sympathy or apologies." She paused again. "The angel was Sapphire, if you were curious. I still remember brushing her hair and calming her nerves the day I walked her down the aisle. A little different than how it was for you I think. Hurt about the same, though..." She shook her head. "Sorry. I keep getting distracted. Your ability to redirect the magic might pull the curse out, but then what? I did the same thing. It just latched onto me. There's no...Destroying it. There's no stopping it from latching onto someone. And the reason I opened with my question about punishment you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, well...You're not even that, so I'd sooner banish you to Avernus than put this curse on you. It'll feel like a vacation by contrast." Another momentary pause. "So just...All I really need you to do is relax for a while. Let me do what I need to do. Then I'll send you back to your friends. They're unharmed, as promised. Then you can get back to hating me, and everything will be right back as it should."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched the woman for a few moments. A plan was forming in her mind, but she wasn't confident it would work. And the risk of it - well. It was a hell of a risk, considering the consequences if her idea failed. She relaxed her posture, arms out on the desk and closed her eyes. Deep breaths, trying to center herself like Star had shown her during the trance. There were the shadows, the negative feelings, telling her she'd deserve the consequences either way. That she deserved to be punished, and this would be one way to ensure she could live the punishment of her sins. Another part of her once again told her that it was the right thing to do. Yet fear existed, fear of it not working and, well, her living with this curse forever. After another few moments, she opened her eyes and looked at Valentina. "I have an alternative offer for you. I take that curse - either successfully put it into another object, or just take it upon myself, either way. And in return, you release Star's mother to her, with a promise not to hurt either of them, my companions, or have anyone else do so either. You'll protect them instead, like your life depends on it. In exchange for no longer having to deal with this curse, at all." It was a pretty good deal for Valentina, Ellesandra thought. At least, unless there was some other underlying reason that Valentina had captured Aurora and was keeping her and Star separate.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina slowly closed her eyes. She drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. "You're not a very good listener, Ellesandra," was all she had to say in response to that offer.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She waved a hand. "yeah and? you're martyring yourself. Either give me the necklace, or let me pull from it, either might work. I'm not saying I'll be able to fix it, but I'm willing to take these risks on here." She placed her elbows down on the table, leaning over and looking at Valentina. "Or, do you want to keep suffering? Do you feel like it's a distraction, other people's suffering, from your own? That you deserve it for the things you've done?" Ellesandra spoke from...experience. "This is an option to get rid of all of that pain, Valentina. Are you telling me that you would rather keep that, and then still hunt down Star and keep Aurora away, than let someone else feel it?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina's response was immediate: "I would rather kill every living being in the entire multiverse than put this curse on someone else. And I say those words as someone who desperately wishes she was still that young girl who helped others. I never want to kill another person. But I've fallen so far from those ideals that I'm beyond sympathy. Don't think me a martyr; that's what you're trying to make of yourself. I'm sure you'll understand these words when I say that if someone must suffer this pain...It's better that it is me. At the very least...In due time, my suffering will mean something. The only life left for me after the things I've done is death."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. "Sure, I might martyr myself, but I'm getting something out of it. And, well." She shrugged. "Maybe I have a plan for it. But this isn't about sympathy, Valentina, at least not mine. Maybe after I take it you spend a day or two talking to Aurora and Star. Sounds like you need some emotional therapy from an auramancer yourself." Ellesandra was only about five percent confident her plan would work to prevent her from living in suffering for the rest of eternity. That five percent though, was enough to give her confidence it was worth it to ensure Star's safety. To ensure she got her mother back, and also enough to ensure she would be protected, in the case that Ellesandra wouldn't be able to later. "You don't have to take the offer, if you want to just take the curse back I won't stop you. But the offer is there, and I would rather you take it and stop hunting Star than to have to kill you later anyways." That last bit wasn't something she actually thought she could do. It was meant as a joke, a recognition that they'd be enemies again and she'd probably die anyways, curse or no curse. Yet, it made it clear the path they were choosing here. Valentina could give the curse up, and protect Star - or she could keep the curse, keep the suffering, and probably end up killing Ellesandra in a few days, weeks, months, whatever.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"You'll never want Star or Aurora to every lay eyes on me, since you're so protective of them. It will kill them just to look at me. Not physically, no. But they'd see the depths of this curse, and if it didn't just put them into a coma, it'd make them immediately reach for the nearest blade and off themselves. It's what I tried to do the moment the curse set into me. Trust me," she said with a huff. "Sapphire has tried more than enough, and she's among the most powerful angels in the multiverse. Seems like adequate emotional therapy to me, when we're not trying to kill each other. I admit I'm surprised at your offer, self-sacrificing as it is. I can't tell if it's something you're offering because of the depths of your hatred for yourself, or the depths of your love for Star, romantic or not. Maybe it's just both." She gently shrugged. "But you're dealing with energies and complexities that are so far beyond your capacity to deal with that whatever confidence you have that you could do something tangible about this curse is deluded, fueled only by your disregard for your own life. Not that I don't understand that, too. But if you'd like to take your shot at killing me here, you're welcome to try. Really, if your only concern is for Star and Aurora, that's your better shot. I'll stand here, no weapon, no fighting back, no dodging, nothing. Just standing here. You do everything you can to kill me. If you succeed, I get release of death. All my thralls die. There'll be contingency that Aurora is freed and teleported right to Star. Worst case, maybe it lets you get out some frustrations on me."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra considered that. In reality, her reasons were a combination of her hatred for herself and her affection towards Star. And, well, it was her duty to get Star's mission finished. This was one way to do it. She didn't actually think she'd be able to kill Valentina at all, but it didn't mean she wouldn't try to just end it quickly, right? She stood from the desk, drawing her rapier, and taking a moment to consider the woman in front of her. Her eyes fell to the necklace indicated, then back up to her face. And then she made a few arcane symbols with her right hand, converting her physical energy into a mana that allowed her to cast spells on herself. The light blue glow appeared around her, the magical defense stronger than she'd cast it previously. She repeated the process, letting the blue glow settle over her rapier as well, empowering it to the full extent her magic would allow her to. At this state, it would be able to pierce through the most sturdy of armors, though the drain on her was about as much as the Haste spell was when she was pushing this much energy into the spell. It wasn't intended to keep up during a whole fight, but to place in for a single blow. Ellesandra took a few steps towards Valentina, weaving around desks as necessary, until she was within striking distance. She took up a fighting stance...and then stabbed towards the gemstone with the point of her rapier. It would be too much to actually expect the rapier to be able to cut through it, like it did with the gem in the pirate captain. Ellesandra was trying, but that hadn't been her true goal either. Whether or not she was able to successfully pierce the gemstone, if Valentina hadn't moved from the strike, it meant that her magic was in contact with it via her rapier. And she immediately attempted to used that point of contact to draw upon the mana within the stone. She wasn't drawing it into herself - which is what she'd done with the armored knight - but instead she was drawing it directly into the magic within the blade, the spell which was being used to sharpen it, make it stronger. An attempt to use the mana within the powerful curse to destroy itself, essentially. It was risky, and she was playing with fire, she knew. She wasn't attempting to draw the curse within her, so technically she wasn't going against the whole not doing that. But she was drawing the curse into her magic, into her own mana, and that certainly came with the risk of it effecting her. That was why she'd empowered her magical shield, to hopefully reduce the potential impact of that happening, but who was she kidding? This was a powerful enough curse to bring someone as strong as Valentina down; let alone a peon like herself. Still, the attempt was made to destroy the gem, fuck the consequences, even utilizing it's own magic to empower her piercing attack - which continued to apply pressure unless anything else happened to stop her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina stood off the desk when Ellesandra drew their rapier. She stood facing them. A magical pulse left her, and all the chairs and desks flew to the side of the room. Violently. Enough to crunch them all into piles of splinters that just lined the walls of the classroom now. Ellesandra was of course unharmed by this, the median line from which all the furniture jettisoned was in line with her and Valentina's dueling line. As promised, Valentina stood in place. She didn't move, nor dodge, nor try to stop Ellesandra from hurting her. When they instead tried to strike the gemstone, the reaction was...fairly immediate. The moment the rapier touched the tip of the gemstone and tried to siphon any of the magic into itself? The whole blade just erupted into splinters of metal that shot out in all directions. Valentina's reaction was to put up a magical shield between the blade and Ellesandra, so they didn't get hot splinters of metal in their eyes or something. No such magic protected Valentina, however, causing small red-hot fragments of what was once Ellesandra's rapier to embed in her arms, legs, torso, and one in her cheek, which did start to bleed. She seemed...Undisturbed by this. She then looked at the tiny stub of metal attached to the hilt of Ellesandra's rapier that was once a blade. Then back up to Ellesandra, looking them in the eye, and had but two words to say: "You missed."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra...blinked. She stared at where her rapier had just been...destroyed. "Huh." Came out, mostly in shock than anything. She had expected a million different ways in which Valentina would just flick her across the room or stop her or something. Absolutely destroying her weapon had NOT been what she'd expected. She held the useless hilt in her hand now and raised it up, looking at it, then glanced at her sheath. Couldn't really use that anymore now, huh? She seemed a little more put out at the loss of her weapon than she would have if she herself had been stabbed instead. After a moment, she took the hilt and pulled her pack off her back, slipping it inside, before straightening back up. "Point made. Lets get this over with and back to hating eachother then, hmm?" Can't say she didn't try, at least. She'd keep in mind potential ways to fix it later, but right now, she really didn't have much of an option here. And she'd just lost her main weapon, which was really not ideal considering they were in a potentially dangerous land once she got back to Star and the group. A knife, which was all she had left, wasn't exactly going to be great to go up against the Blood Emerald with.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina shared Ellesandra's sentiments generally surmised by 'huh'. She hadn't even done anything. She just never imagined anyone would hear how powerful this curse was and then try to suction it into a sword so haphazardly. Maybe if it was slowly infused it might have been able to handle more, but that was too much force and too much power all at once, clearly. Valentina then just looked at Ellesandra, the fatigue and weight on her shoulders clear from the look in her eyes. "I don't hate you, Ellesandra," was all she had to say before offering her hand for Ellesandra to take so she could do what she needed to.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra just huffed at the response. She hadn't had time to draw more of the gem's mana into the blade, considering she was pretty sure if she took her time to do so Valentina WOULD slap her across the room. Or throw her on spikes again. Whatever. With Valentina offering her hand out, Ellesandra rolled her eyes. "Oh you're giving me your hand in marriage? How sweet, I must decline though. You're not quite my type, all dark and broody." She did reach out though, taking Valentina's hand for her to do whatever it was she needed. Ellesandra closed her eyes, taking a deep breath and trying to prepare herself for whatever it was. She was expecting more memories like what she'd gotten when she'd first pulled the curse into her, apparently. When she'd felt the suffering of multiple other people, and how emotionally raw she'd been afterwards, breaking down there. That had come as a surprise then - now, she was going to try to prepare herself for that onslaught if at all possible.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina remained flat-faced as Ellesandra took her hand. She didn't seem much in the mood for jokes. Something about all of this seemed to be deeply painful for her. There wasn't really any way to contrast her expressions against past ones, however, given her previous veil of shadows. She said nothing as their hands were joined. And then, there was a comfortable...White. Consciousness slipped away. And though it wasn't Valentina's intention, her magic and interaction with the curse did evoke a memory. A period of time in her life, that Ellesandra would live out through her eyes. Not in possession of her, but experiencing it precisely how Valentina had experienced it all those many years ago. Periods of passage of time would skip over, and many of the more mundane hours and details became lost in the memory, skipped over as the vision shifted from one scene to the next. Ellesandra would not feel Valentina's emotions as their own during, but...Valentina's thoughts and memories were theirs to relive while Valentina performed what she needed to. Days, months, years of Valentina's life were condensed into what was just about two hours of Valentina needing to do what she must to remove the curse from Ellesandra, but Ellesandra would be blissfully in another world while it was all happening, seeing a past Valentina would have very much preferred to keep buried. When all was done...Ellesandra would wake again, feeling not so different from before, a bit refreshed physically if anything, and would feel their mind entirely having been shielded from any adverse effects of this shared memory, none of the intense emotions that might have otherwise associated with this sort of sharing of memory, with a firm boundary over what were Ellesandra's own thoughts and experiences, and Valentina's. Far, far more divided than Ellesandra had ever been able to experience thus far; such was the consequence of it being controlled by a master of magic, of course. Any reflections on the scene, and how Ellesandra might feel about it all, remained entirely their own to decide. And with it done, Valentina looked...Drained. Pale in the face. Sweating. And slowly collapsed away from Ellesandra, falling onto her back. Still conscious, with eyes barely opened, but...A process that clearly took a great deal out of her.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had expected random images of being abused, of pain and suffering like she'd seen before. She had not expected to see straight into Valentina's past. She was vastly uncomfortable with this, considering this was in all likelihood not a consensual sharing of these memories. She watched as Valentina met Sapphire, fell in love, how Sapphire had disappeared, how Valentina searched for her. And then how Valentina brought the curse upon herself, and the years afterwards. Ellesandra's heart ached for her, but through it all she just watched. She didn't pass judgment, didn't say anything, just let the visions go from one to another, over and over again. As she came out of it, what was apparently only two hours later but felt like an eternity in the memories, she blinked, looking around. She looked over to Valentina who was...falling. Ellesandra reacted by instinct, reaching out and taking hold of her arm as she fell. She didn't stop the fall entirely, but at the very least slowed it so that she was gently lowered to the floor. Ellesandra didn't speak, letting go of her hand afterwards and then standing awkwardly over the woman. The thought crossed her mind, that now would be a perfect time to try to do something against the gem. But after those visions, she was pretty certain she couldn't She crossed her arms, watching Valentina quietly. She wasn't so much as looking at Valentina with pity, than she was looking at Valentina in...disappointment. "Well. I'm going to pretend I didn't see any of that, because I'm sure you were not intending to show that to me. So, Valentina, what is next?" Straight to the point. Valentina was at almost deific levels of power herself, at least compared to Ellesandra. Just because she was winded didn't mean she wasn't still strong, and Ellesandra wasn't going to just sit around and wait for her to rest.


</p>

Valentina gently shrugged one shoulder from her place on the ground. "It doesn't matter what you've seen. I don't care," she said, weak. "What's next is...You leave, I suppose. Not much left for you here. Probably should get yourself a new...w-weapon.." she said, teetering on the edge of consciousness. The portal opened up again where Ellesandra walked in. It would take them right back to where they had been before entering, once stepped through.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked down at Valentina for a few moments, seeing her on the edge of the consciousness. There was a moment where she considered if she could do anything for her, but then she shook her head. Even if she could, Valentina was still a horrible person now. She may have been a good person in those memories, in the past, but now? She was causing the same suffering she was feeling. Ellesandra remembered Lisanna, what those pirates would have done to her if Star hadn't intervened. Under Valentina's control, in one way or another. She turned towards the portal. "Till we meet again, Vallie." And she'd step through the portal, immediately looking around to see if she could find her companions, and ensure that Star was safe.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Valentina said nothing, once more. She let Ellesandra leave. And when they did, they would find the trio of Amara, Amelia, and Star standing in the grass as they had been. No enemies around. Star was...Sobbing. On her knees, face in her hands. Amelia was kneeling beside Star, rubbing her back and trying to comfort them. Amara was standing stalwart, on watch, arms crossed. The moment Ellesandra walked back out, however, Star's face snapped up. She was shaking. Trembling. She'd been crying for a while, it seemed. At least an hour, maybe two. The red, puffiness in her eyes was a clear sign. She shot up to her feet and sprinted at Ellesandra as they stepped out, the portal closing behind them, and threw herself at the knight. "ELLESANDRA!!!" she cried, wailing, and breaking into quite an inconsolable series of new sobs. The immediate connection made clear it was no longer sorrow she was feeling; the sorrow was melting away from her. It was now just...Relief. Overwhelming relief that had her breaking down into tears, even before their allies.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

That...was not what she'd been expecting. She stared at Star as she shouted her name, then braced herself as she felt Star clinging to her. The woman throwing herself at Ellesandra had made one foot step back to balance while she caught her, the look of absolute bewilderment on her face moving from looking at Star, then over her shoulder at Amara and Amelia. "I'm fine Star, shh...It's okay." She said, wrapping her arms around Star tightly and squeezing. She kept her eyes on Amara and Amelia though, mouthing a 'What the fuck happened?' to them. Even still, trying to figure out if Star was just sobbing because of her being concerned for Ellesandra or if something else happened, she was trying to offer comfort to her. Her arms had stayed connected around her, holding her, until one hand came up to lightly pat on the back of her head. Awkward with her armor, and she didn't pet Star really because she didn't want her armor to catch any of Star's hair and pull it. But she was trying to send a reassurance to Star that she was safe, well, and probably even better than she'd been when she'd stepped into the portal. When she'd left, Star hadn't seemed quite so concerned or panicked, so surely they had done something while she was gone, hadn't they?


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia and Amara just looked at each other and gave unhelpful shrugs and sympathetic gazes at the situation, suggesting the cause wasn't too clear. They hadn't been attacked, clearly. No blood, no sign of fatigue or anything else. It took a moment for Star to calm herself, but she was getting there, slowly. Once she had gotten composed enough to speak, she held onto Ellesandra's shoulders and pulled back to look at them in the eyes. Anguish was writ on her face. "I-I felt you die," she said quietly, arms shaking. She was feeling emotionally unstable in the moment, so much that her relief nearly translated to an action she...Wouldn't regret, actually, but was probably inappropriate. She would prefer her first kiss be one that was made in a happy moment, despite how much this moment of feeling like she'd nearly lost Ellesandra made her want to throw it all to the wind and make their affections for each other real. Of course, emotionally, that just translated to...Relief. Affection. General need to squeeze Ellesandra so hard they popped. Maybe a little possessiveness and fear and anxiety to throw into the mix. Of course...Ellesandra didn't die. They were fine. But it certainly gave a glimpse of the pain it would inflict upon Star if Ellesandra ever did actually die. Just the surface of it, for the worst of it passed when Ellesandra was away.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra blinked, looking down to Star. "You felt me...Die?" There was at first confusion, and then there was a clicking in her mind. She probably had, in a way, when she had been thrown onto adamantine spikes. Fuck. Immediate regret at her crassness towards Valentina that had caused that punishment, which had hurt like a mother fucker but also probably hurt Star, emotionally, way more. "I'm very much alive, Star." He reached to take Star's hand and then moved it to her neck, where she would be able to feel Ellesandra's pulse steady beneath her fingers. Normally she would have put the hand on her chest but - well. Armor. "I promise, the worst she did to me was cause a little pain because I was a little shit to her. Couldn't help it, you see an all powerful like being telling you what to do, you gotta just annoy them a little right?" She said this with an attempted smile, but the regret at what she'd done was obvious. Not regret at the punishment she'd actually received, but regret at how Star had apparently felt it. Ellesandra hadn't even considered this. It was also possible this had come from something near the end, when Valentina was pulling the curse from her, but that just...didn't seem as likely. It felt much more likely that being impaled by adamantine spikes was what set Star off, after all. Ellesandra didn't let go of Star, just keeping her arm around her while looking up to Amelia and Amara. "Any chance we can, I don't know, get out of here to wherever we were meant to be going now? I'll tell you all what happened then when I'm not concerned about overhearing cursed goddesses feeling Star's suffering right now." Well, that was probably a confusing as fuck phrase for all three of them, but they'd understand more when she explained later. As an after thought, she added. "And I need to find a place to get a new weapon. The bitch blew mine up."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Well. This adventure's off to a smooth fuckin' start, ain't it?" asked Amelia as she stood up again, said with a deep, heavy sigh. A huge weight was coming off her shoulders. Star closed her eyes when her hand was moved to Ellesandra's neck. Star concentrated on Ellesandra's heart. And in that moment, Ellesandra felt a tiny, tiny echo of Star's heart through their resonant connection. Her racing heart slowly calmed in Ellesandra's presence, feeling their heart. A physical reminder that Ellesandra was okay. It was helpful. Star gently nodded, biting her lower lip as she forcibly calmed herself. Her tears were drying, but a few sniffles and hiccup-y sobs still leaked out. Her hands were still trembling enormously. She'd need a while before she was truly calm again. "I-I...I didn't even know I could feel that...I couldn't feel anything else while you were gone. There was nothing and then just...A jolt. Just...Pain...All over." A shaky exhale followed, then she nodded, trying to smile. Not really succeeding, but...Trying. Amara looked around them. "We might benefit from Star having a moment to collect herself, then being able to guide us. Either that or...If Amelia could get us back to Myst, we could try to use the portal to jump back here but, more on target. Though if our enemies interfered with our arrival once, there's a good chance they could do so again. It might be wise not to rely on portals."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra gave Amelia a wry grin. "What, do most of your adventures not start with three powerful generals of a goddess level magic user show up, whisk one of your companions away, and then make it feel like they killed her?" Humor was the only thing she could think to try to remove the tension and the sadness from Star's eyes. Obviously reassurance that she was, indeed, alive would help but - well. She didn't know what else. So she squeezed Star again and would turn to look down at her. The obvious description of when she'd felt that pain all over was...definitely the spikes. Even more regret filled her now. She would have been MUCH more careful with how she did things - and would need to in the future as well - if Star could feel that. As Amara confirmed that portals probably weren't a good idea - even if she wasn't entirely sure they'd be bothered by Valentina right then - Ellesandra nodded. A moment was taken to sense for any of the shadows nearby. Assuming there weren't any, she'd slide out of Star's hold just long enough to reach down and begin undoing the straps of her breastplate. If the goal was to get Star to calm down enough that she was in a decent headspace to navigate them, then the fastest way to do so would be closer connection. Disregarding any warnings from Amara, if there were any, about removing her armor in a strange land with strange dangers, she'd remove her breastplate and all of her arm guards then pull Star back into a hug - tighter this time, and pulling her head down to tuck it against Ellesandra's chest so she could hear the heart beat directly. "We'll be fine for a while I think." She added, considering how tired Valentina had been. She wasn't sure if the power of her generals were related to her at all, but still. "I left her laying on the ground weak and looking pretty broken when I came back."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia shrugged. "It's about sixty-forty for that to happen," she fired back with a mutually wry grin. There were indeed no shadows nearby. An all-clear was felt. Nobody in present company knew what the hell Ellesandra was doing getting out of their armor, but equally nobody said anything. Amelia almost accused the knight of having lost their mind while they were away, but bit her tongue. Star understood rather quickly, however, and blushed as she was pulled against the knight. There was a...Surge of romantic feelings at that. Star obviously wasn't acting on them, but...Yes, if the plan was to get Star to feel calm, flooding her with positive emotions was a good way to do it. Not that hugging her was always going to fix everything, but...A hug certainly was unlikely to be the wrong choice in a lot of scenarios, even in the times it might achieve a lot less than it did here. Star hugged the knight back, naturally, and buried her head against their shoulder. Amara seemed...Touched for a moment. It was a cute sight, without a doubt. Amara seemed quite happy for the two of them, where as Amelia just kinda...Donned a frown, crossed her arms, and looked away with her usual bout of attitude. Who knows what she was thinking. It didn't matter, of course, because Star managed to find her center after a short while and separated from Ellesandra. She sniffled and wiped at her eye, still shaking visibly, but also visibly more...Okay. "U-Uhm...Probably a bad time to mention I uh...D-Don't actually know my way around the sun or star planes, huh? Mom never let me travel beyond the moon plane. But, uhm. I think I can feel a passage to a nearby settlement. That is...Some trails of emotion that should lead to people, at least."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't really care what Amara or Amelia thought of this. She knew how Star worked, at least generally enough. She needed physical comfort, it would help with almost every emotional issue Star encountered. Obviously it wouldn't work for all but - hugging through armor wouldn't really do it when Star had thought she'd died, now would it? Since there hadn't been any real threat about them right then, she'd seen no issue to provide that comfort. Once Star pulled away, even if she was obviously still shaken and teary, Ellesandra began putting her armor back on without a single comment as to why it was necessary to remove it. She glanced over to Star at her explanation, then back to the other two. "Well, up to you if you want to do that or try going back to Myst. I can't guarantee they won't intercept another portal, but considering they haven't just come down on us right now and killed us now that I'm back and the truce is technically over, I don't see why they would go about doing that. We're just as likely to have them attack us here as we are for them to redirect our portal anywhere." Ellesandra honestly had no preference either way. She just wanted to ensure that Star was feeling better, that they were safe, and they could start their search for Star's mother. And that she get another damn weapon. She was still irritated that hers exploded, though she wasn't entirely sure if Valentina had caused it to explode or if she'd just put too much strain on the metal. It'd been a magical rapier already, so she'd thought it could handle it, but it appeared she might have been wrong.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"If that's your assessment, perhaps it best we go back to the guild hall and get you a new weapon. You'll be a lot more effective with one, though I suspect you have a mean left hook all the same," said Amara with a brief smile. Encouraging of her allies, as always, even if she didn't expect Ellesandra to actually fistfight. Amara had a shortsword at her hip if it was really needed, which would be marginally better than Ellesandra's dagger. "We can requisition it as an operational expense, since if anyone asks I can say you're aiding the guild. Probably best not to push that angle, but a new weapon should fly under the radar well enough. And it's not a lie that you do need one, so." Amara had sway in the guild of course, though there were limits. "Hey, does that mean if I get tired of my whip and want a shiny new one I just have to break mine?" asked Amelia with her usual sass. Amara rolled her eyes and flicked Amelia on the forehead. Amelia flinched and rubbed the spot she was flicked, scowling playfully. "A little less attitude and a little more portal," commanded Amara with a grin, nudging with her head at Ellesandra and Star to join them. It wouldn't be long before the portal opened back up and they were taking one step forward, one step right back to Myst. Ultimately, it was just a walk back through the now mildly familiar place to the same guild armory that Ellesandra had seen before, except this time they were able to take a look at the weapons with more intention. There were rapiers, of course. Magical ones, of likely superior craftsmanship to what Ellesandra had previously. Ones that would even more easily receive the magic that Ellesandra imbued in them, as they were intentionally designed to be used by magic-users of all sorts. While there were certainly even more superior ones that were not within Ellesandra's realm to take, these would still be an upgrade. Among the choices were ones that were imbued with elemental magics. Fire, ice, and lightning, specifically. Each did a slight bit extra magical damage with each strike. Of course...If Ellesandra did want to peruse the other wares, there were spears, halberds, swords, mauls, bows...Just about anything Ellesandra could want, even if they were only going to be taking a single one with them, maybe two if the other was a shield. A shield that they wouldn't be able to effectively use with their right arm injury, but, only Star really knew about that.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra frowned a little at the idea of just taking one of the guild's weapons, but she didn't say anything. Star would see that she wasn't entirely comfortable with that idea, but she also wasn't going to argue with it right now. At the very least, she would be planning to return it when their combined mission was over, or she found another weapon that she could call hers rather than the guild's. And at the command to go back to Myst anyways, she did another check in with Star. She didn't want Star feeling like they were going to be ignoring her potential to lead them to a civilization, or that they didn't value it at all. The entire time, beyond when she was putting her armor back on or taking it off, at least some part of her had been touching Star. Holding her side, a hand on her arm, anything like that. A constant, gentle touch to remind her that she was fine. When they got back down to the guild and were looking at weapons, Ellesandra did take an extra bit of time to figure out which weapon would be ideal. Her eyes skated over the spears, and her right fingers trailed over one or two, but she didn't choose one of them. With her arm injured, and her left arm being out of practice with them, it wouldn't be ideal. Instead, she found herself looking at one of the rapier's offered, choosing the rapier that had ice elemental magic in it. She held it in her hand and ran her finger along the edge, then pulled back and tested a few strikes to ensure the balance worked well. After this, she turned to look at Amara, raising it. "Are you sure it's okay if I use this? I'll be sure to not let this one break, and return it when we're done."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The rapier tingled with ice magic. Its balance was exceptional, feeling like an extension of Ellesandra's arm. It was light, but that didn't come at a compromise to its sturdy construction. It would prove to be both lighter, and stronger than the previous rapier. Which was saying something, given Ellesandra's previous weapon hadn't just been some mundane, common blade. Amara gently rolled her eyes. "Nobody is going to miss it. There'll be a dozen more of those made before you ever have a need to return it. Weapons break. It happens. Why do you think the guild makes sure to have so many backups? If you feel the need to settle things, then pay back the guild by ensuring Amelia and I can do what we need to do. And if you spy any particularly nice books in our travels, letting us take them back here will mean a lot more to the Followers of Myst than a surely well-used blade ever will."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra sighed, shaking her head and then moving to test it in her current sheath, to see if it would work there or if she'd need to get a new sheath too. "Considering I broke my last one because I tried to stab a magical gemstone with enough power to bring a deity to their knees, perhaps telling me they won't miss it is a good idea." She said, mostly making fun of herself at what had happened. She felt bad at the loss of her weapon, but also not feeling comfortable taking Amara's charity. Well, the guilds charity, either way. Sure it would be useful for the guild too, in her travelling with Amara and Amelia. She nodded at the comment about letting them take a book, though she felt like that was more Star's decision than hers. Star might not own the plane or everything on it, but she still felt odd just taking things from her homeplane and delivering them to Myst. "Anything else we need to do for this, then?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The rapier of course had its own accompanying sheath. While rapiers did have fairly standard construction, the one Ellesandra now wielded was subtly wider at the base. It wouldn't neatly fit in the existing one, and thus the old one was likely fine to either discard or store with the other broken blade if Ellesandra was particularly sentimental about it. The others around Ellesandra still didn't know exactly what the knight was on about, having not been there, but there was an assumption that the whole story would be revealed in time. Star was looking noticeably better; the combination of regular touching and reassurance and some time had done enough to get her at least calm enough to stop shaking. The red marks on her face were still pretty obvious though. Amara shook her head. "All yours, Ellesandra. We'll be sure to help you kill many a baddie with it. But before we go losing another day to this detour, let's get back to the portal, yes?" If that was all, then that would be just what the group would do, with a stop for food as it had been a few hours at that point and a brief lunch to get them re-centered would be better than road rations. All said and done, it was a routine repeat of the last time they were at the portal. And when they went through the portal again, they arrived...Right back where they had been before going to Myst. "DAMN IT ALL!" shouted Amelia when she realized that they were, again, not where she aimed to be.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She would get the new sheath, taking the old one and finding a place to discard it and her hilt that she'd put in her pack before. During lunch, she sat next to Ellesandra and shared fruits with her, a silent thing while eating and doing any small chat but otherwise staying silent throughout the meal. She seemed to be pretty quiet overall, thinking about how to explain everything that happened. When they got back to the portal and went through, only to end up in the same spot, she paused and looked around. Then at Amelia. She considered commenting on it, but she decided not to. Amelia seemed like the person to take that personally. Instead, she would look towards Star. "Well, lets go with where you were seeing things then. Not an entirely useless diversion, considering I got a weapon again out of it."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt for Amelia. The magi was clearly accustomed to her magic going to plan. She looked at Ellesandra with a smile and gently nodded once, glad that things worked out. Truly, if they had not befriended these two, Ellesandra might be confined to just their dagger until they could find a suitable replacement weapon, and then buy it, and it likely would have been far worse than what the woman now wielded. But nobody needed to explain to Star that making friends along the way when adventuring was always a good idea, for she'd do it even if it just meant experiencing the beauty of friendship. The connections and ability to look out for one another certainly wasn't a bad thing, of course, but Star had always been an idealist with such things for reasons that took total of five seconds of consideration to understand. So began their journey, properly this time, into Gurhal. There wasn't much talk to be had along the way with everyone keeping an eye out. The landscape and its features were certainly so closely similar to other places that one could be forgiven for thinking they hadn't gone anywhere at all - grassy hills and trees were about the same wherever one went, though there would doubtlessly be differences if one looked close enough. One thing that might come to be noticed was the climate - the ambient heat was greater than their previous adventures, here. Not enough to be sweltering, of course. But it was more balmy. Pleasant, during what was indeed the autumn months. But one could imagine if they had arrived a few months earlier how oppressive this heat might be, then. There were some clouds on this day, but they were sparse. The air was on the dry side. An arid heat, rather than a humid one. A perfect day to enjoy the beach, if they were just civilians enjoying life. This nice day carried the group forward to the small settlement that Star had felt. Only about a half an hour of walking until they were at the border of the settlement. It was a small one. Some wooden houses, what could be identified as a small church, a building on approach that sported a wooden sign that had...A script that Ellesandra would be entirely unable to read, though it certainly had the look of a tavern, and a stone well could be seen in the middle of the settlement. Some people were visible. Some stood around, talking. One was leaving the settlement on horseback, and steered his steed a bit more to one side of the road to make room for the group approaching and gave a nod if eyes met. A group of four children could be seen chasing one another playfully in what looked to be a simple game of tag, with three avoiding one until they managed to touch another, who then became the one everyone was running from. The smell of freshly baked bread was lingering in the air, able to be traced to a bakery. But one thing that Ellesandra would certainly notice about all of these people was that they were not human, not elves, not dwarves...All of them sported fluffy ears and bushy tails of various colourings and patterns. Vertical slit pupils, along with sharp, pronounced fangs accompanying the regular set of teeth. Based on the tail, a safe guess was fox, though they were certainly a breed apart from the two fluffy-eared companions from Myst. More pronounced vulpine features, though this cosmetic difference did little to distract from just how normal it all was. Just people living their lives in peace. On the far side, to the left from their approach, of the settlement could be seen a field of wheat, and a pen of what looked like cattle, though they weren't cows. They had grey, patternless skin, plump and fat bodies, and stood a little lower to the ground. Or maybe they were just that fat. It was hard to get a look at them from this far away. The group of adventurers would certainly attract eyes if they moved into the settlement, though Star was, as usual, keeping behind Ellesandra to lead the way, as that was where she was safest.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra began looking around as soon as they'd begun walking. She was both keeping an eye out for anything of danger and any feeling of the shadows, as well as trying to remember where they were going and getting an idea of the landscape. If they needed to head back this way at all, she would want to have at least a little bit of an opportunity to remember what directions they had taken. When they got to the small town though, Ellesandra quickly eyed the fox like people, then looked at Amara and Amelia. It was a comparison look, seeing what similarities and differences there might be between the two types of animal-like species, or if they were the same. The fact that the man on horseback had nodded to them indicated they were probably a pretty friendly group, especially with seeing kids running around playing outside. Star would be able to notice a bit of a pang of...something in Ellesandra when she looked at the kids. A combination of longing and acceptance that she'd never have that. Ellesandra didn't show this at all though, and in fact didn't even watch the kids for any real amount of time other than sweeping her eyes past when looking for danger. She observed the different buildings and then turned to glance at Star, indicating her head towards the one that looked like a tavern. "I can't read that writing, is that a tavern we can stop in, get some information on our location and directions, and plan our next steps from?" That was ideal, since they didn't really know where in Gurhal they were other than that it was the sun plane. Star had said she wasn't very familiar with this plane, so getting help and directions would probably be ideal. "And we probably should have asked this before, but do the people from this plane speak Common, Star?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had noticed the longing in Ellesandra. It was a common desire. Star herself held it dear to her heart. To be a mother someday. To have such happy, smiling children. To break her fate and give her child a happy life. Not something that was looking particularly likely in her immediate future, given the people who were practically getting in line to mess with her life. Her thoughts were stopped in their tracks when Ellesandra asked their questions, however. She looked at the sign, then at her companions. "Oh. Uhm.." A blush rose upon her cheeks. She hadn't considered this. "...Some do, certainly. But, e-eheh...N-Not...Not everyone. It's not uncommon for people to only speak Gurhalian." She gave a soft smile and rubbed at the back of her head. Amara and Amelia looked at each other. Amelia then huffed. "Well. So much for going off on our own, if that's the case. Fat lot we'll get done if we have to communicate with vague gestures at everyone." Star kept her nervous smile about her. "Uh. But, yeah. That's a tavern. The sign says 'The Dapper Distova'. Which you'd uh, you'd get is a joke, if you lived here, because distova are...really ugly, gross farm animals."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra hummed in acknowledgement, glancing around and then over at the farm animals she'd been able to see at the comment of ugly, gross farm animals. Were those Distova? Not important, though, so she looked back over to Amelia. "Didn't by chance prepare any magical understanding spells did you? Comprehend languages and tongues, I think is what my magic tutor called them. But if not - then I think you're probably stuck with us." She intentionally changed her tone in that last sentence to come off as disgusted, like them sticking together was a horrible idea, but there was a tug of a smirk at her mouth. She was teasing Amelia. "Either way, Star," She said, turning her attention over to Star. Her hand lightly touched the small of Star's back and gently guided her forward to the front of the group, lingering for a second before then pulling away. "As you are the native and can speak the language, perhaps it would be best if you took charge here. I'll be right behind you in case anything happens." She said this reassuringly, considering what had happened with the group of shadows. Despite this looking like a completely polite town, Ellesandra wasn't about to let her guard down anytime soon.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia huffed. "Yeah, yeah, I don't have comprehend languages ready today, but that'll be the first thing I prepare tomorrow," she said, giving a cross of her arms as she shot a playful grin at Ellesandra. Star, however, seemed to be inspired by this line of speaking. She was ushered to the front of the group, but then immediately turned to face Ellesandra. "Ellesandra! Take my hand!" she said, offering both her hands despite saying to take just one. Over-eagerness, excitement, was certainly written on her face. A little sparkle in her eyes. She had an idea, clearly. "I wanna try something. Won't be exhausting myself with this, promise."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smirked at Amelia, but then looked at Star in surprise at her sudden excitement and request. She had both of her hands out and Ellesandra looked down to them, then back up to her. The confirmation that she wouldn't be exhausting herself was more of a salve to Ellesandra's concerns than Star might have expected, but Ellesandra didn't immediately reach out. Instead, her head tilted to the side and a playful smile, one that she'd given to Amelia before - and one that Star had seen in her most recent memory when she was playfully insulting those at the table with her, slid over her. "Star." She said, in a very mock-serious tone. "If you're scared and need to hold my hand to feel safe, you can just ask, okay?" And with those words, she reached out and placed her right, gauntleted hand in Star's held out hands.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star donned a playful grin at the mock-serious tone and words. "Mmmm, I like hugs more for that, but I won't complain," she fired back, with a flash of attraction in her eyes. High spirits, and while she wasn't going to push the issue, there was still that fire in her. She didn't shove her emotions down, like some people who will remain nameless. Her attraction for Ellesandra still burned, and whether Ellesandra particularly noticed it or not before, it would become clear once their hands joined that the flame of her romantic affections had been fanned significantly since it was felt last. Which was...Just the previous night. It was also, at this point, rather difficult to ignore the shared emotions when touching. At least this time, Ellesandra would have nothing but good feelings to see in Star. Happiness. A feeling of safety. The aforementioned romantic affection. Of course, there were smaller, insignificant emotions that were darker. Things that lingered in the back corner of Star's heart she had yet to get over, but such things would always be there in some form or another. Little anxieties, small worries. It was all drowned out by her just being in good spirits, which did wonders to drown out the very real echoes of pain and anxiety she felt over having thought Ellesandra had died. That was still there, but...That wound had healed. It just needed time, now, and maybe a bit more comfort before it left her for good. The anxieties, the pain, gave way to greater depths of affection. But none of that was the focus in the moment. That was just the side effect of touching. No, what Star was so giddy about, was actually testing their newfound resonance for her auramancy. The actual manipulation of aura to allow her to affect the other. A ripple of magic flowed from Star to Ellesandra. Magic flowed into Ellesandra, melding with them, and curiously being entirely unaffected by Ellesandra's natural absorption and resistance. Just as with Star's sympathetic healing, this method of magic, her auramancy, was unimpeded and flowed freely and naturally through the knight. The effect of the magic? A sudden spark of comprehension. The sign was suddenly readable, even if Ellesandra didn't functionally understand how to read it still. But they could look at the sign and read it, understand it, as if it was in common, even as the glyphs still remained entirely Gurhalian. As well, whenever it came time for others to speak Gurhalian, Ellesandra would be able to understand the speech as well. A minor magic, and truly, it didn't seem to have any effect on Star.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There had been affection in her teasing, even if it wasn't as much as Ellesandra actually had for Star. Those feelings were still 'locked up', in a cage with bars wide enough for Ellesandra herself to step through. The attempt to hide them, to lock them up, was still there. The actuality of it? Those feelings were growing large enough that they were demanding to be felt, to be noticed. Even Ellesandra couldn't push them down entirely. And when she touched Star and felt the affection in return, how much stronger they were now from last night, her own feelings sparked in response. They flamed up, as if demanding for Star to be able to feel them too, and Ellesandra swallowed in a what felt like a loud gulp. She pushed at them down, but it wasn't very effective. And then the magic rippled through. Ellesandra had tried not to focus on feeling any of Star's emotions, but with their connection that was just...not really possible anymore. So she felt the anxiety, the pain still further down at her own mistake that lead to her 'death', and then how much the affection just covered all of that. She'd gone from smirking and a little affection to Star to...silent, after the spell was cast. Unsure how to react to Star's emotions, the discomfort with having felt them - and not feeling like she could truly return the affection she felt. The feeling like Star deserved so much better than her, especially considering how she'd hurt Star already so much today. Those dark thoughts circled around, teeth clenched as they swelled up in her chest. The feeling of never being able to have a kid like before rising to the surface as well since it had already been actively there, but now the thoughts of Star deserving better, of Ellesandra being broken and emotionally unavailable, of not being able to be a good partner, of never actually being a 'partner' to someone versus just a sex buddy and the nerves that went with thinking she'd be bad at that, all of this was the response to feeling how strong Star's affection for her had gotten. And she knew that Star felt that in her. Knew that it could be taken as a rejection, and knew that that might hurt her too. Which lead to more guilt. It was a dangerous spiral, and Ellesandra took a deep breath to try to pull herself out of it, glancing up at the sign. She was quiet for a minute, before asking - "Can I speak this too, or just understand it?" She wanted to confirm if she heard someone speaking Gurhalian she didn't just walk up and respond in common like a typical rude tourist. She was also trying to focus Star on what they were doing, instead of everything she could surely see happening in Ellesandra right now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was an unspoken dissonance between Star and Ellesandra on the matter of children. While Ellesandra might very reasonably believe that Ellesandra and Star wouldn't be able to have children together, Star certainly knew that it was possible, somehow, given how she was conceived. Again, somehow. A question that had been burning in the back of her mind for a long while now that she was a grown adult, something she hoped to be able to ask her mother about, awkward as it might be. Or maybe Ellesandra didn't even think about that, maybe they never got that far into thinking about it, and just believed they weren't going to be able to get to make that decision in the first place. She couldn't know. She just knew that there was a longing about it all. Star tried to offer her mystic comforts on it all while she could, about that, about what Ellesandra perceived as their own missteps. She gave them a smile. A smile that said she wasn't upset with them, at least. A smile that said they could talk about it later. She obviously wasn't going to get into all of that in the middle of the dirt road with their companions waiting on them. "Speak common and other people will understand you. You won't know how to speak it per se but...It'll get the job done. It should last until we sleep tonight, so just something to do each morning while we're here. Unless you want me to start giving you Gurhalian lessons on the road," she said, throwing up another playfully sweet smile, trying to keep the atmosphere happy. There was a time to talk about those more emotional matters she could see going around in Ellesandra. This was not it.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The reassurance she felt from Star didn't really help much, but it was noted and felt. It was something acknowledged, even if it didn't make Ellesandra feel any better about herself than she already did. She nodded at what Star said, taking a few moments to look around and recenter herself away from those dark thoughts. She glanced back at Amelia and after a moment, said "Haha I can speak Gurhalian and you can't", actively trying to make sure she spoke in a Gurhalian rather than Common. She didn't know if that would work, or if the magic would automatically make it common or understandable of some form to Amelia, but she too tried to lighten the mood with humor either way. With that being said, she stepped past Star to begin towards the Tavern. Her hand lightly brushed Star's shoulder, a reassurance that she was fine. The kind of fine where there was a fire around you and you were accepting it, but either way. She'd step into the Tavern first, taking a moment to look around and ensure there was no obvious danger here, before walking towards whatever would look like a bar or a bartender.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The magic didn't really work like Ellesandra's joke hoped it did. Ellesandra spoke common and Amelia understood common, so there was no magic to be done. It was when speaking to someone who didn't understand common that it would kick in. Amelia just folded her arms again. "No you can't, grandma, we need you to hold off on going senile for a while, okay?" fired back Amelia, earning a shake of the head from Amara as she looked between them. Star was giggling sweetly. She was obviously happy that these two wound up playfully going at one another like this than actually having friction. The brush on Star's shoulder was met with another soft smile as the group entered. The tavern was well-lit by motes of orange light that clung to the corners of the room, flooding the interior with a sunlight-like brightness that complimented the natural light pouring in from the windows. No dark, broody corners here. There were a few patrons, namely a group of three fox-people sharing some laughs and stories, something about how someone named Nilo failed a teleport spell and got half-melded into a tree for an hour, and hasn't been able to shake the nickname 'woody' since then, as well as what looked to be a couple. A man and woman just relaxing together and drinking the hours away, enjoying the peaceful life. The bartender was a spunky looking girl, a bit on the younger side but mature enough to be working a bar. A long brown apron covered her front over top of a white blouse. Bright orange hair was tied up in a ponytail, and matching orange fur crawled up the back of her fuzzy ears, with some white fluff on the interior. "[Gurhalian] Sun blesses you," said the bartender, chipper and sweet as could be to the group. "Not from around these parts, are 'ya? But 'ya look thirsty all the same, and we've got plenty of cold ale!" Naturally, Amelia and Amara were just standing awkwardly as these words spoken in another language just went without understanding.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had just rolled her eyes to Amelia, and when inside was looking around. She listened to the group make fun of their friend nicknamed Woody, and the idea was a little amusing to her. Still, she made her way up to the bartender and watched as the woman spoke, obviously speaking something other than common based on how her lips were moving but Ellesandra heard it as common nonetheless. This type of magic was odd; she'd never had it cast on her before considering the limitations of magic on her. Her luck, it would have been something like she understood it but it translated it wrong, or she could only understand half of what was said or something. After realizing she was meant to respond, not just appreciate her ability to understand, she cleared her throat and responded. "No, we're new here. Was hoping you might be able to help us with some directions - appears we ended up here on the sun plane when we were shooting for the Star plane, or even the Moon plane eventually, but ended up here instead. You don't happen to have any indication of how we can skip over to the Star plane instead, do you?" Like always, Ellesandra was straight to the point. She didn't think it was a good idea to drink ale right now anyways, and they had just finished lunch in Myst, though they probably should offer something as compensation for information if the young woman in front of her was able to provide it.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The bartender blinked once, their bushy orange and white-tipped tail flicking behind them a few times. She put a hand on her hip, tilting her head to the side. A friendly smile still stuck on her face. "[Gurhalian] Well now, to miss your destination that hard is worth a medal on it's own," she said with a bright giggle. "I kid, I kid. Sorry to hear you're a bit out of the way. Lemme see here, Kaza had a map somewhere's..." she said, then lowered to look around behind the bar. She then rose up again and raised a finger, gesturing to give her a moment as she walked to a door behind the bar and disappeared behind it. She could still be heard: "Kaza! Where'd'ya put the dang map?!" she said, answered by an older man's voice coming from farther away: "Ey? Whassat, Ricca? Oh! The map, uh, check by the...Gah, blast it, the, you know, the.." "You mean the trunk?" "Aye, yeah, yeah, the trunk, I meant to stuff it in there." Some moments of shuffling. Then, footsteps came back. Ricca returned with a scroll case, popping the top off to pull out a map. She set the scroll case down and then unrolled the map along the bartop, turning it so that north was in the upwards direction for the group. Amelia and Amara naturally took great interest in looking at this, and Star had taken to translating the important parts for Amelia and Amara to hear in common while Ellesandra did the talking. The map of Gurhal that was displayed was on the largest possible scale. It showed the land masses of Gurhal, as well as major bodies of water. Intersecting the land masses were three lines, splitting the whole of it into three vaguely equal thirds, each marked with a glyph. Star, in the northern third. Moon, in the south-western third. Sun, in the south-eastern' third. The sun plane seemed to take a bit more space than the other two. About forty percent, with the other two planes roughly thirty percent of the total land share. The distance they'd have to travel based on this map was...Extreme. Made worse by how Ricca pointed to the south-eastern coastal landmass. "We're down here, village of Neet. This is the country of Serdio. King Laho presides over these lands. If'n you're trying to get to the other planes, you got quite a walk ahead of ya. Enough that I'd say adventuring folk like yourselves probably wanna find a way to teleport there. But I wouldn't know anythin' about that. You might head over to the church and see Father Copia, he might know where you could get access to something like that."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded, listening as the woman called for someone in the back to help find the map. She hadn't commented on missing the mark, and in fact was glad that Amelia couldn't hear because she was pretty sure that would have upset Amelia a little, even if she didn't show it. Instead she glanced down at the map that was placed, moving to the side to allow Amara, Star, and Amelia to lean over it to look. She only took a glance to get an idea of where the Star and Moon planes were, and then at where the woman had pointed to. Yep, that looked like it was going to be a helluva trek. Valentina had done a number on their journey, hadn't she? A glance was given to Star, just to see if she was looking particularly upset by this, but looked back over to the bartender after. "Thank you very much for pointing this out. We might speak with this...Father Copia to discuss options. Humor me for a second though, based on the scale of this map, if we were to try to to walk all the way to the Star area, we'd be talking...How long? Two, three months?" She hadn't actually examined the map to see what the scale was or how long it might actually take, but was throwing two or three months out as what was, in her mind, a worst case scenario. Hopefully. If it was any longer than that, then they really needed to try to find a way there beyond walking or maybe even just horseback.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"[Gurhalian] Maybe if you took off sprinting and didn't stop, yeah," said Ricca with an apologetic air about her words, recognizing how time was a factor for these folk. "It'd be six months as the crow flies. Not ta mention you'll wanna steer clear of the Sun Sands here," she said, pointing out a section of the map starting from where the sun and star planes connected on the eastern-most border, lazily stretching south-west in a curve, and connected to a mountainous region. If taking the most direct route from Neet to the star plane, these 'Sun Sands' were in the way. "Unless you're a whole lot better at coping with the heat than you look, that is. I hear even in the peak of winter where your nose is gonna fall off your face, it's still scorching enough to boil the water in your waterskin if you leave it in the sun." Certainly seemed that this destination was chosen to redirect the group to be as far away and to make it as difficult as possible to get where they were going. Star chimed in: "[Gurhalian] Thank you for all your help, Ricca," said Star with a smile, then switched languages to speak to Ellesandra, while also allowing their companions to understand. "[Common] The reason for going to the star plane was to go to Hotenz for work, as it would have been convenient to start there and set ourselves up for the road. We might instead find a little work to do here to offset some cost of travel and maybe some teleportation services. Ultimately, I need to go to the moon plane, back to my home of Veldime." She pointed then on the map to a section on the moon plane that was tucked against the western coast of the moon plane. The country outline was clearly labeled as 'Veldime', and Star pointed to a specific place within Veldime labeled as 'Snowhaven'. Her home. Pointing to that, Ricca looked a little...Uncomfortable for a moment. Ears flattened on top of her head, but she didn't say anything.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let out a soft breath at the running analogy. She glanced at the map again, then shook her head at coping with heat. She tapped the front of her breastplate as if indicating that it really didn't do well in strong heats; she'd melt within it based on the heat being described. She turned her attention to Star when she chimed in, nodding. That made sense, they didn't really need to go the Star plane anymore. They could go straight to Moon, considering their current situation and location. A glance was given over to Ricca, however, when she noticed the difference in posture. She looked back to Star, to see if Star noticed anything, but asked. "Do you see any issues with getting over to Snow Haven, Miss Ricca?" She was hoping they could find a different form of travel rather than walking; teleportation would be ideal and they'd have to speak to this Father about that later. But for now, getting an idea from a local if there was anything specifically dangerous with their target location was important, so Ellesandra had focused all of her attention back on Ricca.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ricca took a few more moments to shift uncomfortably as the question was posed to her. "[Gurhalian] O-Oh, uhm, n-not exactly...T-That is, I've heard you wanna stay out of these forests," she said, pointing to a vaguely circular forested area that bordered a long river. It was vaguely in the way of where they would be going, drawing a straight light from Neet to Snowhaven. It would be easy enough to avoid, just would add a few days of travel. "Heard that place is infested not just with nar lillies, but even a few ob lillies," she said, evoking a surprised look from Star. "[Gurhalian] Ob lilies? Really? I thought those were culled to extinction," she remarked. Ricca shook her head. "Aye, no, the Guardians tried, but they burst into spores when they die, so I hear. Had a Guardian walking through here about oh, three months ago, said they were checking the area for ob lily infestation. Thankfully there's nothing of the sort here. All we've got is a problem with some crimson lageks," she said, pausing to rub at the back of her head to look away. The sort of look that spoke of how bad of a problem it was, but the girl was too polite to ask to impose. "A-Anyway, uhm. Snowhaven just...Well, I wouldn't wanna be spreading any rumours that aren't true, but I just...I heard that place was...Razed, and all." Star met that news with a soft, sorrowful nod. "I know. I'm not expecting there to be much left. But I'm hoping for more information on what happened there all those years ago." It was as good a place to start as any. But it did also mean that it was unlikely to be their final stop. And with the scale of this world, they would need to figure out a way to get around it that didn't involve walking from point to point.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked down at the forests indicated. She had no idea what Ob lilies were, though it sounded like there were some definite strange dangers here. Star would need to be relied upon to point these out, and she'd make sure to ask Star this evening to give them a knowledge dump of the flora and fauna that might be of danger during their travels. She definitely agreed though, that walking to this place was not really a true option considering the time crunch they were under. If there was a way to get there faster, it would be much better considering Aurora was probably not being treated the best within her confinement. "Are there any other major dangers around, Miss Ricca? Looking at things like bandits, any types of large scale fighting going on or beast migrations? Things that we may need to keep in mind during our travels, no matter which form of travel we end up taking?" She glanced over to Amara and Amelia as well. This was...a lot more travel than they'd probably signed up for, and she had to ask herself if they were going to be willing to follow along with the plan. Or perhaps they'd have to break off as soon as Amelia got her language spells setup? She wasn't sure, but they weren't exactly going to be 'exploring' lands on their way. They had a mission, after all.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ricca was at a bit of a disadvantage with all these people overhearing her name and not getting any introductions in turn, but she could tell these people were on a mission so she wasn't going to hold them up with pleasantries. "[Gurhalian] Well, like I said there are crimson lageks running around here, one hurt Keiko pretty bad when she was off trying to gather some fruits in the forest. She's still with Father Copia, hopeful she'll pull through but the wounds were pretty bad." An admission that had Star looking at Ellesandra briefly. Of course, healing was her calling. It wasn't about money, though in their current situation she'd not refuse generosity. Someone was hurt. "Other than that there's nothing major...Bandits don't really come this way much, not too much valuable stuff to steal here. Though as you head inland I hear there has been a whole lot of trouble stirring. Bunch of folk dressed all in black and wearing masks attacking people. We keep everyone safe in their homes by sundown, ain't nobody wants to attract any trouble here." Amelia and Amara were getting a working translation quietly from Star as this went. Summaries of what was said. It certainly looked troubling to them, though they looked steady as ever about the prospect of moving ahead.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra hadn't even considered the dynamic of not sharing names. She was in a 'get information' direct attitude right now. At the information about this Keiko getting hurt, she glanced over to Star and nodded to her. It made sense for her to go help when they were done here. If nothing else, it would make Father Copia more likely to help find a way for them to travel. And, well, this person would be healed if she was badly injured and if Father Copia wasn't able to handle the healing himself. She looked back at Ricca. "We'll stop by the temple shortly to see if we can't provide any assistance in healing this Keiko, and to ask Father Copia about travel methods. Thank you very much for the information, Miss Ricca." Ellesandra reached down to the coin pouch that she still had - since they hadn't thought to give the money back to Star now that she could use her magic again - and pulled out a few silver as an appropriate tip for the conversation. Turning back to their group, she spoke up again. "So, anything else needed in regards to looking at this map or shall we go speak with Father Copia to get a better idea of the danger nearby and travel methods? Depending on what those might be, we can potentially come back here to spend a night before setting out."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

While Ricca had been helping only out of the kindness of her own heart, and thusly was confused by Ellesandra just dropping silver on the bartop, it remained true that this village was not extraordinarily wealthy. The couple of silver that Ellesandra casually provided was what the tavern would make on a big group, and this without the cost of replacing the ale would ensure the plucky bartender and her family would be able to feel that much more secure when the local lord came around to collect taxes. So, it was with a blush and a humble lowering of her head that Ricca accepted the kind gesture. Whether Ellesandra noticed the impact or not, Star certainly did. Nobody asked the knight to do that. But Star could see how touched Ricca was. No auramancy would be needed to see the approval writ on Amara's face. Amelia meanwhile was looking a little more...Pragmatic, then looked at Ellesandra. "Ask her how much for the map, and the carrying case. We'll pay double for it, since it might be harder for her to replace given how far away they are from a major city." Which, of course...Amelia could just wait until the group got to a city and bought a map there for a more standard price. But even if Amelia wasn't showing it, the circumstances and convenient reason to pay double spoke plenty about the woman's heart. "And if they have any other materials that provide useful insights - geography, reference materials, anything, well. The guild provides gold for just this purpose, no reason to not make use of it."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had pretended not to notice Ricca's obvious blush and acceptance of the coin. She didn't notice Amara's approval though, having been looking at Star, and then Amelia when she spoke up. Ellesandra looked confused for a moment as to why she was offering double before it clicked. A nod was given, and then she turned to look back at Ricca. "My companion here, Miss Whippersnapper, would like to inquire as to how much you might be willing to part with the map, and any other materials that might provide geography or cultural references. She would be willing to pay double what you might have paid for that map, considering the understandable difficulty of getting one here from any major city." A pause, and then she added just to poke at Amelia even more. "Forgive her for only speaking common, so unfortunately either I or Star -" She motioned to Star "will have to translate for her during this negotiation." Ellesandra had let a smirk tug at her mouth at being able to poke fun at Amelia again, but otherwise she looked entirely serious. Which, she was. If Amelia was offering to buy this map for double the price, she wasn't about to try to negotiate the price down for the guild; there was an obvious need for coin here and she wasn't about to tell the two Myst natives how to use theirs.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a very small but purposeful thud against the back of Ellesandra's left shoulder coming from the aforementioned whippersnapper. A playful punch, but nothing further. Though crossed arms and a face that was trying and mostly failing to look unamused was present if Ellesandra looked over their shoulder. The brief look Ellesandra had given at Star had shown a beautifully bright smile. One that only grew bigger as the moment continued. Generosity was something Star loved to see, and loved to practice. That she had such a unique gift could have allowed her to walk a lucrative path, pricing her capabilities high knowing there wouldn't be anyone else who could do what she can. Yet she always kept just enough to get by modestly. Things were different now, at least until their quest was complete. Gold could be the difference between life and death in the way of ensuring they were properly armed to face whatever was standing in their way. So it was a much needed soothing of her natural desire to give to those in need seeing all that happened here. While Ricca was hardly squalid, this certainly did seem like the sort of place that was tight knit, and the money would over the next few months get spread around well enough. Here was hoping the local lordship wasn't the sort to catch wind of it and find reasons to take it all away. Of course, maps were no easy thing to make. Cartography took years of exploration and vetting of scales and accuracy. This map before them seemed to be of decent quality. Well-maintained, certainly. It detailed geography and some major settlements, fewer smaller settlements, but mostly showed country borders. One map wouldn't be enough for Myst. The more maps they could compare, the better, in fact, to understand what was true without having to have someone personally vet the accuracy by visiting the locations in question. The fact that the map showed Snowhaven still existing on the map suggested that it was older, however. At least as old as when Star was sent away from her home, unless that section of the map was simply copied from other maps. Or perhaps it remained listed, regardless of its state. Whatever the case, Ricca perked up again and was left visibly uncomfortable at the idea of having to price her map. Not because it meant anything to her. It was just a map. But she was just a girl who grew up in a simple village. She didn't know how to price things, and that uncertainty was clear. And that was compounded by the promise of a major windfall. Poor people often grew nervous at the prospect of riches. "[Gurhalian] E-Excuse me a moment, please," she said, raising a hand to hastily move into the back room again. Quiet conversation carried on, privately. The two whose hearing might be keen enough to pick up on the conversation if they had a reason to - which they didn't, really - also didn't speak the language. Ricca returned after a minute or two, smoothing her hands over her apron to calm herself, then gave a smile at the group, plucking the map case from where she had deposited it earlier along the way. "U-Uhm, papa says that the map was given to him by a friend, but it'd cost us about seventy-five gold to replace it." An honest answer by any approximation. Truly accurate cartography was worth a whole lot more than just the materials it was made from. But Ricca didn't seem to have a dishonest bone in her body. Star would be able to tell if the woman was lying, anyway, but Star just kept on smiling. Star took the liberty of relaying the price to their companions. Amelia and Amara had no clear reservations on that price. So fifteen platinum coins were counted out and placed on the bar top. Ricca looked like she had never seen platinum in her life. She had a very uneasy look about her, as if worried this was all some elaborate scheme. She carefully plucked one of the coins from the pile to examine it against the light. While not uncommon for people to briefly examine coins to ensure their authenticity, this was clearly someone examining something they had never seen before, confirming the earlier look. The woman looked a little overwhelmed, but did snap out of it to, with slightly shaky hands, carefully roll the map back up and slide it back into its case like it was a fine piece of art that dare not be damaged. She closed the case and held it out to Amelia, who smiled sweetly at Ricca and took it, handing it to Amara, who slung the case by its leather strap over her shoulder. There was a touched, gracious expression on the fox-woman's face. Star leaned in over the bar, smiling with that knowing, reassuring smile of hers. Of course Star could see exactly what was going on in the bartender's heart. "I know it's a lot, all at once, Ricca. Four strangers wandering in out of nowhere, asking all these questions, throwing around this kind of money. I hope it does a lot of good for you, and the people of Neet. You seem like kind folk. You deserve good tidings."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had staunchly ignored the punch, playing it off as if it hadn't even been felt. Ricca heading off into the back to discuss with someone wasn't surprising, and in the meantime Ellesandra had turned to glance at the group, then around the Inn again. With them discussing money like this, she wanted to ensure no one nearby had been closely listening or eyeing them with the predatory look of a bandit or pickpocket. Once Ricca came back out and stated the price, she glanced over to Amelia and Amara as Star translated the price. Ellesandra hadn't honestly expected Amelia to pay double that price. That was...honestly, a lot of coin, even for Ellesandra these days. Oh, she'd seen plenty more coin passed around by Marigold before, but beyond their windfall from Morrun she hadn't seen that much going al together since leaving her home. They certainly were gracious with the guilds resources, considering they'd also all but gifted Ellesandra a very fine rapier, magical as well. Star's reassurance to Ricca wasn't surprising, considering how Star could surely see nerves and probably other things in the bartender. With that business done, Ellesandra lightly knocked her knuckles on the top of the bar counter then pulled away. "Alright then, thank you Miss Ricca. We'll be off to see the Father. If the transportation needs and business requires us stay for the night, are there rooms available here?" She wanted to ensure Ricca that if they needed to stay, Ricca would have more of their business. Not that it was a guarantee they would need to stay, but Ellesandra had a sneaking suspicion the father didn't just have a teleportation stone or or circle lying around that he'd let them use scot free without helping the town out. Perhaps taking care of this problem that had injured someone? She wasn't sure, but she wasn't expecting this next conversation to go entirely easily.


</p>

Ricca gave a hasty nod at Ellesandra's words. "[Gurhalian] R-Really, honestly, c-consider the rooms yours to use however long you need!" she said, her fingers still lightly trembling. The implication being that they wouldn't be charging the group for the rooms. "There's a-ah, six rooms in the back, just a bunch of single bed rooms." Of course, this being such a small place, the inn was simple, and the amenities were similarly sparse. There was a single shower to share among the rooms, something that rarely mattered as the only times the tavern's rooms got used was when the odd traveling merchant wandered through. Decided lower in amenities than Myst or even the inn from Cloverport, but it was...Cozy. The other people in the tavern had taken note of the adventurers, but the patrons were simple folk. There wasn't any sly looks going to the group. The others minded their own business, though they could obviously overhear it all with their keen furry ears. The feeling in the air was very much one of a mix of awe and intimidation. Actual knights in shining armor between Amara and Ellesandra, not a sight often seen in a place like this. The people here weren't troublemakers on their worst days, so they were on extra good behavior given the obvious weapons being carried by people who obviously knew how to use them. "We'll be sure to pay the standard rate for the rooms if we need them," said Star, wearing her usual soft smile as she subtly reinforced that they weren't going to be staying for free. Star could tell that Ricca needed a minute to process all of that, maybe take the coin back to that other unseen man - their father, it sounded like - and celebrate a little. So she casually nudged with her head to lead the group out of the tavern, if there was no other business, to move over to the church they had seen more central in the city.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had shaken her head when Ricca said that the rooms were theirs. She did nod at the information about there being six rooms. That would mean they'd need to use two, or three? She glanced at Amelia and Amara curiously, but would assume they would each want their own room. Her and Star would be sharing a room for obvious protection reasons. Not for any other reasons at all. Nope. She refused to admit that to herself. With Star's not so subtle hint for them to head out towards the church, Ellesandra turned and began heading towards the door. She'd open it and do a cursory sweep of her eyes around, again keeping a feeling out for any nearby shadows, but assuming the coast was clear would hold the door open for the rest of the group before falling in line with them towards the church. She didn't speak until they were a few steps away from the tavern, but when she did she directed her words to Amelia and Amara. "We should probably ask now so we're on the same page, Star and I will be sleeping in the same room. I can't guard her if we're separate. Will you two be sharing or should we get three rooms anytime we stop somewhere? Also, this is probably moot considering the coin you just spent on that map, but will you be struggling for funds if we stay at taverns along the way or will we be fine on that front?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The group piled out of the tavern to find that the dirt road was dirty, the air was airy, and the people were exactly as calm and idle as they had been when they entered. It did truly feel like a town where nothing much happened, and people could just live a slow life. The furry-eared children who were playing tag had settled, burning out most of their energy, and were sitting and patiently listening to a story being told by what looked to be a clergy member in front of the church. A man dressed in white, reading from a leather-bound tome. A bit too far away to hear what it was about. Amara and Amelia looked at each other when hearing Ellesandra's question. Amara answered: "If money gets tight, Amelia and I can bunk together, but generally we keep more than enough to cover separate rooms. And when the entire First Crusaders are together, well. We'd not fit in that tavern's rooms, so we have usual partners for doubling up. Amelia usually bunks with Ayden." Amelia rolled her eyes. "Much to my displeasure, the big lummox snores like a dragon, and doesn't even stop when I jam my elbow into his fat rib," said Amelia, surely demonstrating what a nice relationship she had with her brother. Amara chuckled. "The costs for lodging for you two can come from our guild funds as well. We've taken a fair amount with us, but given all that's happened, it might be prudent for Amelia and I to return to Myst tonight on our own before bed and inform of the situation and secure additional funds. It appears that your enemies fully intend on keeping us away from our goal, so while I initially planned on Amelia and I making frequent trips to and from Myst, if we just end up back in the field over yonder," said Amara with a backwards nudge of her head. "Then that might be off the table. If we end up traveling halfway across the sun plane only to go back to Myst and be booted back to the southern corner, well...Your mission cannot afford such delays. Best we reassess and plan ahead. Even if there's no other reason to stay here tonight, I would say it's probably best we do for this reason alone. As to your original question, Amelia and I have our own funds we can spend on whatever, but travel expenses are, within reason, something I can expense to the guild." An unlimited coffer of travel expenses was certainly a nice boon to have, though it did seem they would need to come up with a figure that they could ask for up-front to fund everything they'd need, and then ration that out. "It also means we'll need to be more conservative with our expenditures, Amelia. I've no qualms with doing a good deed for the people here - on the contrary, I'm glad you did that. But when it comes to the rest of this journey, I believe we'll need to be more pragmatic. Much as it's a tenet of being a Follower to embrace altruism and do good where we can, we can't help everybody in the course of accomplishing our mission," said Amara. Amelia huffed. "Obviously, captain. I'm not Rinnie. You don't have to explain this stuff to me," she said, then paused and said something to herself, a little quieter: "...Still woulda given top coin...Nice map..." Yes, because it was all about the map, and nothing else; Amelia's denial stood like a ten foot tall mirror before Ellesandra, even if that denial of self was for reasons that were worlds apart from one another.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked between Amelia and Amara a few times. The light scolding from the captain was...not what Ellesandra had expected. If Amara was going to say anything about the payment, she'd expected it to be harsher. Then again, Ellesandra was used to a very firm hand when it came to command. Sia had definitely seen to that. The thing was, there was a little bit of disapproval in Ellesandra that Star might be able to see, but she didn't show it or say anything about it. "Understood. Your idea is a good one. It's also possible that the portal would only redirect if I and/or Star were with you, so if there is no magical limitation on you testing that it may be worth doing so. You two just happen to going the same direction, until Valie-bitch begins visiting either of you in your dreams warning you off from Star, I don't think you're a particular target of hers." She paused, then added. "And perhaps we should congregate in one room tonight before bed so I can give you the download on what happened, too." She'd almost forgotten that. She'd been trying to avoid thinking about explaining her 'death' to Star, knowing Star would be upset at her for all but actually asking for it, but that had also meant she wasn't thinking about sharing the information with Amelia and Amara. And if they were going to be travelling together, they definitely deserved to be kept in the loop. She glanced up to the priest and the group of kids all sitting around for a story as they neared, but she was silent, either listening to the group respond to her or just focused on going in this Father. It was possible this man was him, but she didn't want to interrupt story time if she didn't have to.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star looked curiously at the disapproval she saw in Ellesandra. A curious blink, but nothing more to it. Understanding Ellesandra's perspectives on things was something of a hobby for Star at this point. Just thinking and examining. Considering and contemplating. She did a lot of that, and even if she was good with people, had shown on multiple occasions that she did prefer to take a bit of a back seat unless she was needed. Not that she wasn't social, quite the opposite, but Ellesandra's direct manner of addressing things - while maybe not always ideal - had done well so far. She wondered what it might be that Ellesandra disapproved of. Then also had to wonder who 'Valie-bitch' was. Something Amelia pointed out, in no particular rush to pass up a chance to throw some playful attitude at Ellesandra. "I know it's easy for you to forget with you being senile and all, grandma, but now that we're in a safe place it's probably a good time to mention that you've been talking to yourself about a whole crapload of things since you got back out of that portal that exactly none of us have been able to follow. Soooo don't mind us all looking at you like a crazy person until you actually sit down with us and explain it all later," she said, briefly donning a smirk. She could have just said 'hey, you're talking about stuff you haven't explained at all to the rest of us', but she where was the fun in that? There was some ability to put two and two together with context of course, but it was true that a proper sit down was due. "If you don't mind putting your attitude on pause for five seconds, Amelia," said Amara, still clearly light-hearted and not genuinely reprimanding the woman. "I think it's fair to say that as long as we're aiding you two, we're legitimate targets. Better to assume so than assume we're safe, I'm sure you'll agree." A matter she didn't expect to lead to much disagreement. As they approached, the story the priest was speaking came into audible range, and it was clearly a light-hearted tale meant to reinforce the caution one must have around hags. The latter half that could be heard naturally had the valiant hero defeating the hag with non-violent means, power of friendship and love and all, but it clearly came with more serious undertones that hags were evil and not to be trusted. The more adult version that educated on the proper response being a sword to the hag's neck could wait until these children were grown and not quite such adorable, innocent fluffballs. The priest looked up at the group approaching, mindful of the stowed weapons, and looked to the children. "[Gurhalian] All right, children, that's it for today's story. Now I hear that Jezza has a surprise for you all, one that.." He paused, dramatically tilting his head up to smell at the air. "I think I can smell might be just about done. But you'll all have to be good and help her clean up afterwards, okay? Remember, everything's easier when we work together." The children acknowledged the man's words, but were clearly mostly just excited about this surprise that was likely food related. If Ellesandra focused on the smell in the air, there was just the tiniest, faintest smell of something tasty and sweet. Best guess might be...Pie? Or perhaps some other sweet pastry, and was wafting down from the bakery. As the children turned around, excited and eager to get to have dessert, their paths met with the group. Amara and Amelia being up front, one of them nearly ran head-first into Amara. Naturally, the captain's reflexes kept them from doing so with gentle, armored hands on the little fox's shoulders. The children looked to be no older than eight or nine. The child in question, who went a little pale not just because she nearly ran into Amara, but also because Amara was...Intimidatingly tall. "Woah, easy," said Amara, her voice as soothing and sweet as a mother's. The little girl didn't speak common, something Amara remembered after a moment. Amara then descended to one knee, hands easing off the little girl's shoulder. Communicating through a language barrier was hard, but...Amara reached into one of the pouches on her belt and produced four, paper-wrapped caramel candies. She unwrapped one to let the girl see it. Amara's eyes looked up to the priest, who had been a little wary, but there was a trustworthy air about Amara; while it took a whole lot more than just being a paladin and having a reassuring smile to get someone like Ellesandra trusting them, it worked quite well on the general public. Star, smiling at the small display, was sure to chip in her part to bridge the language barrier: "[Gurhalian] It's okay, little one," said Star with a similarly tender, sweet voice. "It's a caramel. Don't bite it, just suck on it," she said, then looked at the priest. "Is it okay?" she asked, deferring to him for permission. The other three children had paused for a moment as they observed the near accident, and the four sets of small eyes flicked to the priest for him to make the final call. The priest considered the look of the group for a moment. Wary, of course. Not that he'd distrust them all himself, but he was thinking about the children. To that end, he stepped forward and plucked one of the wrapped candies to unwrap and examine. Sight and scent. They were obviously candy just be looking at them. But no amount of scrutiny was too much when it came to children. "[Gurhalian] Have another?" asked the priest, to Star, who relayed the question to Amara, who nodded and reached into her pack to pluck another out. The priest then put the one he had taken into his mouth. All things that the children didn't quite understand, as made clear by the uncertain looks. The age-old adage of not taking candy from strangers came to mind, but the small town folk were clearly the trusting sort. Bad things rarely happened in this place. Great evils had nothing to gain from this place. So a little nod was given. "Go on, Marra, you can have those to tide you over while Jezza finishes up the pie," he said, earning some excited cheers from the children who moved in to be handed a candy each. They then each bowed to Amara before scurrying away. The priest gently folded his arms before him in pious greeting, briefly crunching the candy and swallowing before addressing them. "[Gurhalian] Sun bless you," he began. "How may I help you fine folk on this day?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

That was exactly why Ellesandra was going to sit them down to chat tonight. But, she didn't have a chance to say that before Amara mentioned they were still targets while travelling with the two. A nod was given, even if that wasn't the point she'd really been making. No need to get into semantics right now, and they were right that they were in the dark a bit, so Ellesandra didn't feel irritated at the call out like she normally would have. In reality, she should have sat them down and talked with them about it before they agreed to come. It's not like they couldn't leave whenever if it got too much for them, but she doubted that would happen either way. As they approached the priest and he dismissed the children, Ellesandra was watching the priest more than she was the children. When one of them almost collided with Amara, she froze and glanced around, checking for a trap. A child as a distraction was an easy way to get normal guards or people off kilter or to let their guard down, after all. So when she found none, and simply observed the interaction between Amara, Star, and the child, she relaxed some. The suspicion and steps taken to validate the safety of the candy by the priest was also well respected too; he was a cautious man, and that was probably a good thing here. Strangers like them surely didn't venture into town too often. As he gave the same sun blessing greeting that the bartender had, Ellesandra considered returning it. She eventually decided not to though, glancing at Star briefly and then at the kids who had been running off, before focusing on the man again. "Good day. Ricca at the tavern suggested we come talk to you in regards to potential transportation across the sun plane, as well as mentioned there was an injured villager here who may need assistance. We have an excellent healer in our midst who might be able to help, if that's the case and needed." Ellesandra didn't indicate to Star as being the healer. Depending on the man's intentions, pointing out who was the main healer of their group could be potentially threatening to them. Sure Amara was surely capable of healing too, but Ellesandra didn't know the extent of her powers and didn't want to speak for her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a strange glance at Ellesandra. Not a judgmental one of course. Just one that was about as confused as when Ellesandra went looking in the shower when they arrived at Myst, and, she suspected, had half a mind to check for monsters under the bed, too. Ellesandra was paranoid. But Star had known them long enough at this point to know that, and that it probably served them well as a guard. But Star was such a trusting person that the notion that someone would use children as a distraction to trap them was so unfathomably alien to her that it earned the briefly confused look. She didn't comment, of course, just assuming Ellesandra was being careful, which she didn't mind. The priest gave a difficult look, but ultimately a thankful one. "[Gurhalian] Ah, she has told you about Keiko. Most fortunate that you have a capable healer, yes," he said, gesturing to the church doors. "Please. Come in, let me take you to Father Copia. As well I...Notice you might prefer to speak Common. Father Copia and I do know Common, if you'd prefer to converse in that language. Whatever is easiest for you."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had ignored Star's strange glance at her. She didn't know what it was about, and there was no point in asking right now. It would involve an unnecessary conversation about why Star thought something was strange to begin with, which would lead to talking about her seeing auras, which might make people uncomfortable. Instead she focused on the priest, and then nodded. "Yes, Keiko. And if you speak Common, that would be great. Unfortunately two of my companions here don't speak Gurhalian or currently have access to the magic which would allow them to understand. Easiest if we can all understand eachother without need of translation." She would wait for the priest to begin moving before starting forward though. She was very polite about it and made it look absolutely natural, giving him a soft smile and motioning for him to lead the way while they followed behind. If he did lead the way into the church, she would step in first and do her customary sweep of the place before continuing in to allow Star and the rest in behind her, only to quickly fall back to being beside Star.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The priest nodded. "[Common] Very well, then we shall speak in Common," he said, earning a look of relief from Amara and Amelia. "Glad the language lives up to its name to some degree still," said Amelia, mostly to herself. As they moved into the church, it would prove to be about as small and intimate as expected based on the exterior. A small chapel for services. There were polished wooden pews, an ornately worked stone pedestal that held a glass bowl of water near the entrance, and thin white carpet running up along the main passage between the pews to the altar. Behind the altar was a magical, illusory image of a waterfall descending into a pool of still water. The imagery clearly had major significance, which Ellesandra would be able to identify as the holy symbol of the goddess Eldath, a pacifist goddess who served Silvanus, and was known as the Mother of Waters or Goddess of Peace, serving the tenets of serenity, comfort, and healing. Star looked at the holy symbol with recognition and warmth. Naturally, it was a goddess whose message resonated with Star personally, even if Star herself wasn't all that religious. Eldath was often associated with druids, but had a general following among pacifists of all sorts. It certainly explained the trusting nature of the fox folk here if this was the dominant religion. The chapel had stained glass windows depicting images of Eldath in various poses, and two people could be seen quietly praying in the pews. They looked just the same as anyone else in the village, and did clearly seem to be looking for peaceful solitude here. "My name is Father Verma," he said gently, voice lowered while in the chapel. "I am a student of Father Copia. I will be taking over the service of this chapel when the time is right, but for now any matters concerning the village should be brought to him," he explained, mostly to ensure the others knew that he was doing this not because he wasn't able to help them, but he had to respect the order of things. He moved with the group quietly to a passage behind the altar, leading up a set of steps to a medium-sized room that had two beds, one empty and one with a wounded fox woman laying, unconscious, under a blanket with a wet rag on her forehead, fluffy white tail hanging slightly out of the side of the blanket. Father Copia himself was seated at the far side of the room at a desk, faced away. An older man, not so old that he struggled to move, but defined wrinkles yet unseen and grey hair and fur showed he was likely in the latter half of his life. "[Common] Excuse me, Father Copia, I have brought visitors from outside the village," he said, stepping aside and gesturing to the group. Father Copia looked over his shoulder and then slowly stood. He had a gentle set of eyes and black, formal robes. "Ah, Sun bless you all, and the peace of the Mother of Waters as well be upon you," said Father Copia. "They have come seeking aide in traversing the planes, and have mentioned they have a talented healer among them who may be able to help Keiko, Father," said Father Verma. Father Copia nodded. "Aye, very good, very good. Please, travelers. Tell me what you seek, so we may aide one another." While the men conversed, Star gave worried looks over at Keiko, the wounded fox woman. Her natural instinct was to just...Rush to help them. But Ellesandra had purposefully not pointed her out, and she knew that wasn't without cause. So she let them take the lead, ready to move to the woman when given some sort of signal that it was time to do so.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra followed along, her eyes scanning along the church as they went. She obviously noted the signs to Eldath, but didn't comment on it. The interest and the apparent recognition by Star was noted, but again she didn't say anything on it. She was on her guard as they moved through, watching for anyone to be in wait somewhere, and as they stepped into the room with the injured Gurhalian she did another quick glance around. Star wasn't keeping her interest in rushing to Keiko hidden well Ellesandra hadn't thought...or maybe she was just becoming more in tune with Star's habits, interests, and getting better at reading her. Either way, she reached out to lightly lay a hand on Star's arm, before turning to meet Father Copia. "Good day, Father Copia. I am Ellesandra, and my companions are Star, Captain Amara, and Amelia." She would motion around, introducing all of them as they had been introduced to her. She wasn't sure if Amara wished to keep or drop the Captain title, but she'd rather be over cautious and respectful than not so. "Normally I'd like to get right into it, but I don't want to give any implication that our offer to assist Keiko here is dependent on your willingness or ability to help us in our travel. If it is okay with you, may Star take a look at them to see what she can do to help via mundane magic, if anything?" That would be the first focal point of their conversation. An olive branch, obvious intent to help rather than bargain their ability to help, as well as to allow Star to go check on Keiko rather than being on edge and looking at her worryingly the whole. Ellesandra had glanced over at Keiko only enough to show she wasn't an obvious threat, and there was no feeling of shadow from her, but assuming there had been none she'd continue to get Star to her sooner rather than later. She had, however, specified via mundane magic. Hopefully Star picked up on that and didn't suddenly try her sympathetic healing on the woman if it wasn't necessary.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The term 'mundane magic' had confused looks spawning on the faces of everyone except Star. That was an oxymoron if one had ever been spoken, but the benefit of the doubt was given and truly, there was no point in trying to figure out what that meant. All that mattered was the offer to help. "Of course, of course," said Father Copia. "Please. Anything you can do. She was struck by a crimson lagek. Her wounds are grievous. I have been able to keep her stable with some potions I was able to brew, but her wounds have been serious enough to warrant keeping a close eye on her," explained the priest. Star smiled at Ellesandra. The touch on her arm had been enough to bridge their emotional connection to reaffirm that Star was deeply concerned for the wounded woman. The worry was significant, but contained. The fox woman was obviously stable. Once released, Star moved to the woman's bedside and drew the blanket back to get a look at them. The point of injury was obvious. Their lower abdomen, entry point from the right side, curving to the left. Blood on the bed below them suggested it was an impaling wound. The blood pattern on the bandages gave the wound's definition a straight shape, but far too tall to be that of a sword blade. Naturally, since it was said to come from what sounded to be some sort of creature, it was likely a natural weapon. Perhaps a talon? It looked vaguely close to that. Star moved to sit on the edge of the bed and moved a hand over the site of the wound, gently resting her palm over it. She closed her eyes, then, and sat in quiet focus. While doing this, the most peculiar thing happened. Atop Star's head spawned two furry fox ears, complete with white fur, along with a white fox tail poking out from under her skirt. The conversation with the priest would naturally begin again here, but understandably this change drew the eyes of everyone else in the room as surprise and astonishment washed over them all for what they were seeing. Did...Star just turn into a fox woman?


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had watched carefully as Star moved over to Keiko. She didn't care if the others were confused at the mundane magic comment. Star seemed to understand, and that's all that mattered. She'd waited until Star was settled and began to work before turning back to Father Copia. "While she's doing that, perhaps you can tell us about these Crimson lagek? Ricca also mentioned them but I'm afraid I don't know what-" She trailed off, eyes turning back to look at Star who now had fox ears and a tail. That...was new. She didn't even mask the surprise on her face. Was she just taking on a form similar to that of her patient, or was that a more natural form for her? It didn't make sense that it was just an illusion magic, considering she hadn't had them in Myst where magic was limited. It could be something with her aura, but then again Ellesandra didn't remember seeing the ears or tail even in Star's memory with her mother. No, this had to be some side effect of how she was healing Keiko. Ellesandra hoped that didn't mean Star was using her sympathetic healing, but she wasn't about to interrupt and potentially cause an issue. "Know what they are." She finished finally, turning her eyes back to Amelia and Amara to confirm they were just as confused as she was, before looking at the priest. "If we're to spend any real time in this area - and we plan to stay the night here, at the very least - we should be aware of the potential dangers or beasts around."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

That the conversation was continuing in the face of whatever was happening was a little jarring. Everyone just going to ignore that? Yeah? All right. Amelia and Amara were exactly as confused as Ellesandra, as were the two priests. Father Copia cleared his throat. "C-Crimson lagek are a somewhat common predator species in the sun plane. They have a naturally armored carapace, and most closely resemble grasshoppers. Though, they are about twenty feet long from tail to head on average, and stand and walk on six sharp legs. The main concern with them is that they are able to spit a jet of sticky threads from their maw, which very swiftly can immobilize people. It's not impossible to break out of, but for those of us who aren't meant for battle, it's all but a death sentence. They have long, scythe-like claws they use to strike their prey, usually after immobilizing them. Their carapace is a dark red colour, hence their name. They also may try to trample you, or bite. If you're planning to fight one, you must be cautious. They have acidic blood that will melt mundane armor, and have three hearts." Father Copia sighed. "If it sounds like a lot, I'm sure you can imagine why we've been much happier to lure them away with cuts of koltava meat from the cattle ranch we have here, rather than risk anyone fighting such a beast. It is a sub-optimal solution, of course. The repeated feeding has no doubt kept the beast coming back for more, which led to it being close enough to harm Keiko here. But the alternative was that we try to chase it off with torches, and in doing so risk the lives of the men here. It may be too mighty a beast to be threatened by such a thing, and we have been awaiting aide from the crown, but thus far we have not heard any response from King Laho or his lords or ladies, and each month when the tax collector comes we are told simply to wait, and continue to try and lure it away. I'm afraid more injuries like Keiko's are only a matter of time. But, if Miss Star here is able to heal her, then we may yet be done with this issue before then, once the kingdom sends its aide. So...What was it you needed, then? Travel, was it?" Just as Ellesandra had not held back Star's help as a bargaining chip, so too was the priest offering his aide openly. He had shared the truth of the dangerous monster that plagued them, but did not ask the group to take on such a task, and did move along to what they needed without expectation.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Why waste time being curious? She wasn't about to interrupt Star to ask, and they could ask Star later. It wasn't like they couldn't get work done, and them all hovering around Star while she was healing might just distract her. No, best to continue with the conversation. As the creature was explained, Ellesandra frowned and her concern deepened, looking over towards the woman on the bed, injured. "Sounds like a dire beast indeed." She commented dryly. There was no need, or point, in offering to help right now. That would require discussion, even if the thought had crossed her mind. She had been serious when she'd told Star, and shown her that memory of being late to training, that they needed to focus on their mission. But if their mission just so happened to put them in the path of this beast - well. Ellesandra wasn't about to look the other way in that situation. Refocusing on the task at hand, she continued. "Star and I are seeking a way to the Moon plane, specifically around where Snowhaven used to be. We understand that there have been some troubling reports from there and it no longer stands, but it is our destination nonetheless. Captain Amara and Amelia are here as..." She paused. Did they introduce themselves as ambassadors of Myst or anything? She looked towards them, leaving it open for them to introduce themselves however they wished. Whether that be their real purpose here, seeking magical artifacts and the like and documenting culture of Gurhal, or if they wanted to say they were simply along for the ride on Star's mission. She wasn't about to speak for them and their goals here, not knowing their protocols on such.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Comrades, of course," said Amara once she realized it was being passed to her to speak. "And of course, just 'Amara' is fine," she said more for Ellesandra than for the priests. Father Copia gently nodded. "Aye, I'd heard of grim tales from Snowhaven, but it is a world apart from us. Though the old suffering teaches us that we are one people, there truly is no reasonable aide we here in Neet could provide," said Father Copia with remorse clear in his voice. "I am afraid I cannot offer you any information on what it is like over there. But, what I can provide, while not a direct answer to your troubles, is something that will be of more use to you than it is to me. You see," he continued, briefly clearing his throat. "I was once a member of King Laho's army, before Eldath's light brought peace to my life, and before my tied old body protested most vehemently against my continued armed efforts. I have...And old friend, the air captain of the Seventh Fort, specifically. If not he himself, he will know how best to secure you transit upon an airship. I would be happy to write you a letter that vouches for your generosity. An airship will be able to carry you to Snowhaven, or at least the nearest major city; such a trip would be quite expensive, but I trust my old friend to find something that will work." Expensive might be relative. What was expensive to the people of this simple village might prove to be chump change for the Followers of Myst, though their available funds remained to be seen. But if they could secure the service of an airship, it would surely allow freedom of transit across all of Gurhal. Months would become days. And while it wasn't as instant as teleporting, it was certainly AN option. Just as long as nobody was afraid of heights.

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to Amara at her explanation. Just comrades then, and no captain. She'd note this going forward and for future introductions. When Father Copia continued to speak about his days in the military, Ellesandra did take a moment to look at him again. She wouldn't have previously guessed he was a military man, but it didn't really change anything now. "We would appreciate that, I think. There is no rush, as we're planning to do some things tonight and then stay at the Tavern to plan our next steps. Where may we find your old friend? Is he in town, or shall we plan our trip to a neighboring fort to request assistance?" Like always, Ellesandra was to the point. No need to beat around the bush and comment on his military history or that she'd never been on an airship before. They could discuss later what that might look like for the group, and if there were any issues with it. She did glance over at Star, eyeing the new ears particularly. There was a...temptation. To reach out and pet them, scratch behind their ears. She obviously resisted this temptation, not only because she didn't want to distract Star form healing Keiko but also because it would be entirely inappropriate to do in public, or without Star's permission, and was definitely not something she should do as Star's guard. Definite line she shouldn't cross there. Right?


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a general nod of agreement about them appreciating getting an airship, or just the chance at it. It was better than walking. And while traversing the entirety of the realm would still take them a week or so, or thereabout, they were looking at the better part of a year to cross it on foot. The plane was great and vast, and there would be no way to properly traverse such distances if foot and horse travel was all they had. "Ah, my friend, his name is Albert Lamington, he is stationed at the Seventh Fort, a day's travel afoot north of here. It is a military garrison so you will likely not be able to stay and rest there, either, but about an hour inland from there is the town of Lidiera, along the coast. It's a fishing village, but the flat ground there was used to prepare and launch airships when I was still part of the military. Were I a betting fox I would wager that would be the best chance for boarding an airship around here," explained Father Copia. As he finished explaining, however, a heavy breath left Star, and her magic subsided. She blinked a few times as she opened her eyes, and her ears and tail simply vanished with a soft puff of silent blue magic like they were never there to begin with. She looked at Keiko, who was slowly opening their eyes. She smiled, seemingly either unaware or uncaring about how she was just a fox-woman for a handful of minutes there. Keiko moved to sit up, but Star laid a hand on their should. "[Gurhalian] Shhh, hey, no no no...Easy. Easy. You don't wanna sit up just yet. You're better now, but, the healing is just freshly done. Give it at least a few hours before you move around, just to be sure it doesn't tear open again," she said, smiling sweetly at the woman. Keiko looked at Father Copia, who was overcome with relief at seeing the woman awake. "[Gurhalian] Do as she says, child. She has healed you out of the kindness of her heart, she has my trust, so too should she have yours," said Father Copia, evoking a soft nod from Keiko, who then looked up at Star with a great deal of gratitude in her eyes. "[Gurhalian] Thank you, miss. I-I...I don't know how I cou--" began Keiko, interrupted by Star: "Shh, no, I won't have you thinking you owe me. That you're alive and well is all that matters," said Star, slowly rising from the bed to return to Ellesandra's side, then gained a bit of a weird look about her as she saw the weird look that Amelia and Amara were giving her. She looked at Ellesandra, the confusion clear as day. Did she have something on her face?


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded. Albert Lamington. A days journey away, potentially staying in some place named Lidiera. That wouldn't be so bad. They could discuss that progress later when in their room. "We appreciate that, Father." She was soon distracted, however, as the puff of blue magic surrounded Star and Ellesandra turned to her quickly. Her hand was already reaching for her weapon, unsure what the puff was, but she didn't draw it. She just watched as the tail and ears just...disappeared. And she seemed to pull away, while Keiko woke. A glance was given between Keiko and the Father, then back to Star as she reassured the fox woman that she was fine and safe but needed to rest. With Star returning to her side, with everyone looking at her oddly, Ellesandra just raised her hand and patted the top of Star's head. "That's unfortunate. Those ears were cute." Though she'd said this as an attempt to add humor and tease Star a little, the statement was true either way. It might also confuse Star, but they could explain that she'd grown a tail and ears during her healing later. Instead she just gave Star a smirk before looking back to Father Copia. "Is there anything else you'd like to discuss? I'm sure you need time to check on Keiko, let any family members know she's okay and write that letter you mentioned. We can stop back by here tomorrow morning to check in on her and pick up that letter before setting off, if that sounds alright?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra's response did not at all clear up the confusion on Star's face. It just made it worse. She blinked, raising a hand to tug at her right earlobe. Tug, tug. Her ear is cute? Or were they talking about Keiko's ears? She was quiet as the business was concluded, but that confusion was not going to go away without an explanation. The priest gently shook his head. "[Common] No, I think that is all for now. What you say is about the short of it. I will ensure everything is ready for tomorrow morning, yes. I appreciate all that you have done, more than I can express in words. Her husband and son will be elated to know she has recovered. Father Verma, would you like to go bear the good news to her family?" he asked of his student. The other priest nodded. "[Common] It would be my pleasure, Father Copia." With that, Father Verma gestured for the group to adjourn down the steps and back out of the church. If there was no business for him specifically, he was swift to head off down the short path to the residence of the family to share the good news, leaving the group their own devices again.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra knew it had just confused Star, but she didn't say anything yet. She nodded to Father Copia. "Thank you." And with that, she would follow Father Verma out of the church. She did look around, ensuring again as they went out no one was waiting for ambush or anything like that. When Father Verma headed off to let the family know the good news, she turned to look at Star with incredulity on her face. "Were you not aware that when you were healing Keiko, you had fox ears and a tail on your own body? I've seen you heal before - you've healed me, and I was in the camp a good amount when you were healing those elven soldiers. I never saw you have a tail or ears, or take on any aspect of them in your healings. Or me, for that matter." She kept her voice down enough that she wouldn't draw attention, but there was a mixture of amusement, a bit of disappointment that the ears weren't permanent, and also concern for Star. She hadn't been sympathetically healing Keiko, had she?


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was quite used to pain, but Star also wore just about every emotion she ever felt openly on her face. She hadn't shown much the one time she had used her sympathetic healing on Ellesandra, because it was really just some minor cuts. Annoying, and maybe she winced once or twice from them, but it wasn't a life-threatening wound. Truly, if she had used her sympathetic healing, she herself would be clutching the site of the wound and be visibly in pain. Even if she was a stoic warrior, it was a wound that impaled them all the way through - even if Ellesandra didn't piece that together from the limited evidence. All signs pointed to her being a good girl and using her more typical magic rather than auramancy to heal. So when Ellesandra pointed out what had happened, she went bright red in the face. "I-I-I what?!" she exclaimed, reaching up to the top of her head to feel for the ears that weren't there. "I-I mean I...It was a really bad wound so I needed to join our auras for a while there, b-but...But are you sure?!" Yes, better make sure that Ellesandra wasn't just having a fever dream and imagining that she sprouted fox ears and a tail.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched Star's obvious surprise, then shook her head. "No, I'm not sure, I totally imagined you growing ears and a tail. Just like I imagined everyone in the room stopping to stare at you." She reached up and ruffled Star's head where the ears had been, intentionally messing up her hair with a smirk. "Learning new things about your powers every day." Ellesandra appeared to be in a...playful mood? Well, she was certainly more smiley and interactive than she'd been most of the trip, that is. She glanced over at Amelia and Amara. "Or is this old granny losin her mind, Miss Whippersnapper?" To Amelia and Amara, it would just look like she was in a good mood, that was. Star would be able to see that Ellesandra was masking. She was trying to deflect with humor, in embarrassing Star so that Star didn't look too closely at Ellesandra's aura. She couldn't block that, but she could at least try to distract and deflect while she felt the not-so-caged feelings stirring strongly. The desire to have reached out, scratched at those ears. The feeling now to cup Star's face and tell her she did a good job, healing Keiko. The desire to kiss her on the forehead and call her a dork for not knowing that she grew ears and a tail. All of these were being fought against, and she was trying her best to prevent Star from noticing.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It took Star all the way until the ripe old age of seven years old to be able to see straight through the deflection that Ellesandra was performing. To trust in what she saw in the aura, rather than what she saw someone doing or saying explicitly. There was no world where Ellesandra's deflection could hide what they felt. Hide their desires. It wasn't too dissimilar to how she saw through lies, though this was entirely rooted in fears rather than duplicity. Ellesandra had nothing but the most...Beautiful desires in their heart. So as Ellesandra went on joking about, they touched Star's head to ruffle her hair. Ellesandra felt a little rush of happiness, of good feelings, of mirthful, playful joy at that gesture. Of course Star was receptive to Ellesandra being happy. But that happiness wasn't going to mask the rest of her feelings, feelings that Ellesandra could no longer hide from just by not focusing on them. And those feelings burned against Ellesandra's hand when they touched Star. Like a bonfire's tongues of flame licking at the knight's skin, it was briefly intense. But it did not sear. It did not singe. It caressed. It kissed. It lovingly embraced their touch. It was the quiet voice in Ellesandra's ear, tenderly whispering to them as hands coiled around them and lips brushed against their earlobe. And the sweet words it whispered encouraged Ellesandra's feelings. Invited them. Told them in no uncertain terms that it was all not just welcome, but wanted. Badly wanted. Sorely wanted. Wanted with such strength of emotion that the ache it produced throbbed across Star's entire being. It was a feeling that had grown from sparks, from the small flame of a candle to a steady bonfire. There was still so much room for it to grow and blossom outward but...It was clear there was no going back now. The feelings once fledgling had become seated, spreading their roots deeper into Star's heart with every time their eyes locked, every time their fingers touched, every time she saw Ellesandra being the kind and compassionate and thoughtful woman they were. All of that...For just a moment. That it was just for a moment was the only saving social grace that might allow Ellesandra to keep a straight face through it. For tempering those feelings was...Understanding. Ellesandra's fears, their doubts, the plagues that mired their heart had not gone anywhere, and Star was emotionally mature enough to not brazenly act in haste in spite of these very real troubles. Star wanted to kiss Ellesandra on more than just their forehead or cheek. But it was from that same affection that she did not, for it was cruel to ignore the depths of Ellesandra's struggles, to minimize them or simply say with profound naivete that everything would be okay and just expect those words to cure everything. Such complexities were difficult to process in the matter of seconds that they were felt, but there would be time for them all to flow through Ellesandra and let the knight feel what there was to feel. And in the meantime, Star was left giggling at the hair ruffle. "H-Hey, you're gonna make it all messy and tangled," said Star mirthfully, moving her hands up to smooth out her hair again. Amelia of course chimed in to answer tease-for-tease: "I dunno, grandma, you're talking to yourself more and more these days, we can't rule out that possibility," she said, smirking and naturally latching onto the positive energy. "Maybe if I just, hmm..." said Star, pausing thoughtfully. "If I try to recall those feelings...It's not like shapeshifting or polymorphing is exactly groundbreaking for magic.." Star paused for a moment, focusing inward. Was she about to willfully assume that form again..?


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra should have known better than to touch Star while she was trying to hide emotions from her. The feeling of Star's returned affection caused her to pull her hand away faster than she otherwise would have, even if she still ruffled Star's hair a little. She clenched her fist briefly, matching the clenched jaw as she worked to push the feelings she'd just had flood into her, burning desire from Star aside. To ignore it, and pretend she didn't notice. To pretend that her own feelings didn't flame up in response, demand that they go find their private room right this moment. She watched Star for a moment longer than she normally would have, eyes flicking down to her lips while she was so focused on trying to bring the ears back. After a pregnant pause from her, Ellesandra said - "Don't do anything that will wear you out, Star. You already healed someone today, and cast the language magic on me. Save your energy." And then she looked up to Amelia and Amara. "And, I'm sorry about that. Lets get ourselves a few rooms, settle in and then you two can meet in mine and Star's room? I'd rather not talk about all of this out in the public area of the tavern where the natives might be able to overhear." She wasn't sure that there was anything particularly bad about them overhearing, but best to be safe rather than sorry. She didn't know what any local cultural politics affected things, or if there might be spies.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra's pregnant pause was a bit too long to stop Star from what she was doing. By the time they had said not to wear herself out, pop! Ears and tail were back, though this time she was aware of herself. She blinked, twisting her figure to look over her shoulder at her newfound tail, and practiced swishing it back and forth a little. Then, eyes turned up, and those fox ears flicked and flexed a bit. "...Huh." Was all she had to say. And then just as soon as they arrived, they burst and vanished again just as before with a little burst of tiny motes of blue light that flickered away after a moment. "Oh, uh. And that was pretty minor. I did a fair bit of healing on Keiko, but you'd do well to remember that I was able to heal multiple life-threatening injuries in quick succession back with that whole Cloverport incident. It's just healing you that takes all I've got," she said, smiling as she laid a hand on Ellesandra's arm. A calm reassurance flowed from her, though she kept it brief as...The flame of affection was still there, and she could tell it was triggering a response, so she wasn't going to agitate that. "But I appreciate you worrying, always. I'm okay. Got plenty left, if I need it. Promise." Another smile. Then, the two girls from Myst nodded to the plan. "Aye, sounds good, though really there's nothing to apologize for, it goes without saying in my mind that much has happened, and we've not had much time to privately debrief on it all," said Amara. They were speaking in a language that demonstrably most of the people here didn't speak, but nobody was going to argue that talking in private about these matters was wise. If not spies, then generally just the chance someone overheard the crazy things they were going to talk about and understood them was a scenario best avoided. If all was agreed, then the group was free to execute on the plan. Rooms were paid, with only a small amount of pushback given from Ricca who tried to insist that enough had been paid already, but clearly didn't need much convincing to give into the truth that a little injection of wealth could do a lot of good for the people of Neet. Most in the village would see only a handful of silver added to their savings each month after costs of living and taxes were taken into account, so the sudden, all-at-once injection of over a hundred gold was monumental, and if used for community benefit could be the seed that started this town on the path to prosperity. A better life for the children. Ricca had a good heart to not give into greed, but thinking about the young kits and building a better life for them, and perhaps even her own children if she might find love someday broke any resistance. Coin was accepted, room keys provided, and Amelia and Amara got themselves settled in before joining Star and Ellesandra in their room. The rooms were, as expected, rather modest. Four walls, a bed, slightly creaky floorboards, two oil lanterns fixed to opposite walls that could be lit for light, and a window with shutters to let the natural light in, or to close and latch if one wanted privacy. The only furniture besides the bed, which was admittedly pretty comfy if simple, was a desk with a chair, and a trunk at the foot of the bed to store things in while staying. Naturally, expecting there to be limited seating based on their own lack of sitting area, Amelia and Amara hauled the chairs from their rooms in along with them, so everyone had a place to sit, though Star and Ellesandra could easily just sit next to each other on the bed, facing the other two in their chairs.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had stared at the ears and tail again. Once again, something about them just made her want to scratch behind Star's ears. She didn't, though, the temptation well and truly controlled. The feelings she'd seen from Star at their touch were still fueling her own desire, but the idea of telling them all everything was doing a good job of dampening it. When they got to the tavern and got their rooms, Ellesandra had begun to take her armor off to get relatively comfortable for the explanation coming up, and had asked Star before Amara and Amelia came in whether or not she was comfortable with Ellesandra sharing details of Star's magic and their journey and such. She was pretty confident Star would be okay with this, it wasn't her story and information to share so she didn't want to do so without asking. With said confirmation, Ellesandra had chosen to pace at one end of the room instead of sitting on the bed next to Star. Star would be able to see a nervous energy about her, as she still hadn't decided how much of her OWN story she was going to share. She didn't feel comfortable sharing much with Star, let alone with Amelia and Amara. Once they were all in the room and sitting down, she reached up and tugged her hair out of her ponytail, mostly for something to do with her hands and play with the long strands while she spoke. "Okay, so before I start, please let me chat before interrupting about things." Ellesandra looked very pointedly at Amelia at this comment. "And a brief heads up on mine and Star's magic. I'm particularly resistant to any forms of magic that I've found, other than Star's Auramancy since it seems to interact with my aura rather than my physical body. Divine, arcane, nature based, - all of that tends to not work well on me. I can absorb the mana of a spell and translate it into my own magic, which is a more physical energy magic. Amelia, that's why my Haste spell takes so much out of me; it's burning my physical energy and power rather than any arcane mana. Conversion isn't one to one, and I can redirect magic with the conversion as well" She paused for a second, looking at Star, then continued. "And Star's magic is aura based. She can manipulate it differently, and thus in some ways bypass my innate resistance. She can also see auras, which helps her to be empowering to people and support them better both emotionally and magically. This makes her, and auramancers like her, natural leaders and people who tend to bring together enemies to join forces and such. A danger to those this wouldn't benefit, of course." That was a very, very quick summary, but Star could elaborate more on her powers later if she wanted to. That was enough detail for the point of what she was going to be sharing. "I know you probably have questions on that, but you can ask after. To start off, I ran into Star when just travelling on the road and she was being attacked by pirates. After taking care of them, we agreed to travel together to the closest town at the very least. Which was overrun by those very same pirates. Star explained her mission to return to her home plane, to find her mother who sent her away during an attack to protect her, and she was meeting up with an elven mage there who would be able to help direct her on how to do so. We met him, but found his wife was being held captured by the pirates. So, we staged a diversion and rescue for her, and escorted the two back to their elven settlement." She paused, running her fingers through her hair and lightly tugging on it. This was a completely unconscious movement, but one that helped keep her focused. The small pricks of discomfort at her hair being tugged kept her focused, somehow. It always worked for her when she had to share uncomfortable stuff verbally. "I was visited in my dreams during that time by a shadow calling themselves 'Black Diamond'. They were trying to scare me off from Star, warn me away from guarding her or letting her hire me. Implying that if I just left her alone, she would give up on her search for her mother, and therefore they would not be forced to kill her. Well, if you know anything about Star she's not one to give up even if I weren't there, so I figured that meant she needed protection even more." A deep breath. "So, we joined with elven soldiers and fought off the pirates in Cloverport, including a shadow-imbued captain that was like the three who appeared earlier today. Black diamond's commanders, so to speak. I stabbed him through the head and he just kept on fighting, almost killed me. Had to stab him through the gem in his heart to actually stop him - thanks to Star using magic to hold him in place for me. We got information about going to Myst then and where to find you all, but we took a few days rest to recover from that fight. During which, someone named Sapphire also appeared in my dreams, the supposed 'good' balance to Black Diamond. She's an angel and didn't appear as a shadow, so I knew a bit more about her. She prevented Black Diamond from just taking control of my dreams and giving me nightmares, like they'd been doing, and gave me the choice to have normal dreams or visit one of them to chat. I visited Sapphire one night and she confirmed that Star's mother is in fact alive, but is being help captive by Black Diamond." Ellesandra glanced at Star at this. There was still some regret at the pain this conversation had caused, even if she was still confident it had been the right thing to do. "Well, that was the day I met Freya and she gave me the card. Then we spent the day planning out our trip and headed to meet you the day after. We also met Black Emerald that day as you know, he's the shit who sent the magic armor after us. And while fighting it, I'm sure you noticed that I tried to draw it's magic into myself to slow it down or weaken it. I thought I could redirect the magic into my own and because it's entirely a magical being, it'd make it easier to fight. Turns out doing so I pulled a curse that Black Diamond themselves has, into myself. So I saw a lot of people suffering and some really horrible things." She didn't feel the need to comment on how she'd broken down after seeing those. Or go into detail into what exactly she'd seen. "I didn't know I'd pulled the curse into myself, so we went into Myst and everything was fine. Apparently, the curse was dampened by Myst's magical prevention measures, so I didn't have any negative effects there. But when we came out, the reason Black Diamond wanted to talk to me was because she wanted to remove the curse from me. Said no one deserved to live with it, and she wouldn't wish it on anyone." Ellesandra cleared her throat, deciding to restart this part in more detail rather than the very high level summary she was giving before. Her goal was to give the basics, and let Amelia and Amara ask the questions that mattered to them since she knew they probably would anyways, but Star deserved to know more about this part. "Well, I stepped through the portal, and ended up in what looked like a classroom but with red swirling dust in the ceiling and out the windows. Black diamond is some powerful being close to deity level, and I admit I'm not a big fan of beings like that anymore. So when she told me to sit down I chose to be a little bit reckless, assuming she'd have just killed me if she wanted me dead, and chose to sit somewhere that would annoy her. She may have sent me falling for a few minutes and then impaled on a bunch of spikes for that." A glance was given to Star. There was true regret that, at how Star had apparently been able to feel that and how it had effected her. "I immediately appeared in the room again with no real injuries to my body, so I'm not sure if she actually killed me and brought me back, or if it was something in just my mind like a psychic thing, but I definitely still felt it like I'd been killed. Either way, I gave her space after that and she explained she's cursed, and I unintentionally drew some of the curse into myself. She wanted it back. We chatted about if I would be able to break her curse but I think the answer to that is a pretty solid no, and I'm not confident she'd let me if I could. The curse prevents her from dying so - she might be using that in her plan to war with the gods and destroy them, and all." Oh. She hadn't mentioned that before, had she? Well, she had now. "Anyways, she drew the curse from me and sent me back. And revealed her name is Valentina. I also got to see how she became cursed while she was drawing it from me but - well, I don't think that was an intended side effect and I'll refrain from sharing her personal details that have no matter to this conversation unless I have to." Ellesandra finished, taking a deep breath and turning to face them all. "Questions?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly had no qualms with sharing her personal details. Hard as they might be, and Ellesandra would certainly see the little wounds, the pinpricks of pain, at certain topics. Her mother being held captive, mainly. But it was an example of how Star dealt with things in that moment; she had been wounded in the moment, she had cried when she learned of it all...But now? She was okay. It wasn't hurting her anymore, not conceptually at least. It obviously still hurt because her mother was still captive, an active sort of pain, but if anything that just emboldened her to action rather than break her down to cry. Amelia had given a little smirk at the pointed look about not interrupting, but otherwise had a serious expression as she listened, one leg folded over the other to ensure her skirt didn't reveal anything immodest from her posture on the chair. Amara sat bolt straight on her chair, arms folded and just listening with an expression that showed empathy any time the story drifted to the rougher subjects. Not quite as obvious and compassionate as Star, of course. But as tough as Amara was as a fighter, she clearly had a softer heart. She was no Sia, that was certain, even if she could drill students just as well. Flashes of recognition showed on Amelia's face at certain points. The explanation of magic, the reason Ellesandra broke down...Everyone in attendance was listening close. Star in particular was mindful of Ellesandra's emotional state through it, knowing their pacing and hair were points of self-soothing for them that she'd seen before. Everyone...Needed a minute with all that. "I don't want you to feel bad about what you did, Ellesandra," said Star. "To be honest I...Didn't even know I could feel that sort of thing. It's all very new to me, too." She then looked at the others. "Er...To explain, the reason I got so upset out of nowhere in the field. I felt Ellesandra's death that she described. That's a large part of how auramancy works. Magical empathy is one of the core pillars of it. But I'm sure you also know that auras have a general understanding in arcana; your devotion aura, for example, Amara. It's just a product of your natural aura, something that is a part of you, an extension of your soul, burning with the divine energy that flows through you. And Amelia, I'm sure you're familiar with how many enchantments classify as 'auras' when they linger on someone and affect others near them. That's the same idea. Injecting arcane energy into an aura can make it produce the effects you're familiar with. That's another pillar of auramancy - the ability to manipulate another person's aura to produce effects. It takes time and you have to...Connect with someone, in a manner of speaking. Things like friendship and general closeness with another person make it easier over time to perform auramancies on others. Each person has a certain level of natural attunement with any other given person. Some people have a major resistance to my auramancy, others have a natural acceptance of it. And those natural qualities would be different if the auramancer was my mother, for example. So even if I had a naturally strong connection with either of you, my mother wouldn't necessarily have the same. That is all to say that just because I'm an auramancer doesn't mean it's always straight forward with others to use my magic. But, being close to someone, physically touching with things like putting my hand on them, and purposefully strengthening connections in mutual meditation, can strengthen that connection, either temporarily or permanently. The apex of that, where my aura can connect with someone else without inhibition, is a state called 'resonance'. Normally, resonance can take months, years even to build with someone. It's not required to make auramancy work effectively, but it does make it a lot stronger. My mom explained to me that she only wanted to be resonant with my, er, other mother, Robin. And she was, but Robin died before I was born. I could always see how that took a part of my mother, Aurora, with her. Not something I understood when I was younger but...Because auramancy is such a deeply personal form of magic, it's equally vulnerable to things like...People I care about getting hurt, or dying. There's a natural attenuation for auramancy to lead to strongly defensive and curative magic. Healing and abjuration come very naturally to me. But just the same, it seems that even if separated by planes or vast distances, that connection stays constant. We mentioned it briefly in the past but, Ellesandra and I are resonant. We were from the get-go, which, well...I've met a lot of people in my travels, and I've never been resonant with them from the start, nor did I ever build resonance with anyone else. All a bit of a long-winded explanation to help you understand why I broke down," she said, blushing a little, but keeping her emotions level throughout. Amara responded: "So, what happens when Ellesandra gets hurt? You mentioned it's a protective magic, and it's fortunate that it is able to bypass this...Resistance Ellesandra has. I've seen you heal her before, but you mentioned just outside that it's still harder for you to heal her," said Amara, met with a nod from Star. "There are methods I can use to heal with auramancy, but the only one I've mastered is called 'sympathetic healing'. It's a method of healing someone else, and it's made easier or harder by the strength of that connection I have with them. It's fairly effortless to do on Ellesandra for me. But the caveat is that while it does heal the other person, it does this by transferring the wounds onto me. Now, my magic is empowered by how well my aura can 'flow' through a given aura, and there's not any aura it can flow through better than itself, so healing myself takes substantially less mana. So in the process of transferring this wound, I'm able to heal it before it actually manifests on me. Even grievous wounds, life-threatening ones. I don't actually open wounds on myself from this, but...I do feel the pain from the wound for a while, as if I did suffer it. It fades over time, and I can speed that up with meditation. So even something like being stabbed through the gut, I could take from someone and be fine after a day or two at the most if I focus on it, longer if I let it happen passively. Of course, there's something to be said that being in excruciating pain makes it hard to meditate, but truthfully that's something my mother trained me to be able to do. It's a skill that's useful to auramancy, to be able to meditate and do what we call achieving 'purity of self' no matter what pain we feel. If that purity of self is ever broken, I can't use my auramancy, and I generally feel pretty awful. I can't get sick normally, but any time my purity of self breaks, it's like having a really awful flu." Star took a moment to breath here. "And, it's also important to know that, as much as it's not a tactic I encourage, if things ever do go wrong and someone close to me is in danger, that...Need...The strong desire to protect them, can push my auramancy into a sort of...Empowered state. Any time I'm in crisis, it's like a fount of mana explodes inside me, and while I never really am thinking too clearly in those moments, since I'm just acting on emotion at that point, I'm able to far exceed my normal limits. Not without probably passing out after the fact from exhaustion or something close to that...At the very least gives me a nasty nosebleed. But given who we're up against I...Figure it's probably going to happen at least a few times that we get into a crisis situation. If you see my eyes sort of...Brighten and go a solid colour, go ablaze with mana, just understand that's probably what's happening." Another breath. "Sorry. I know this is all complicated. Really I'd...Love someday to be able to explain it all more so it could be recorded in Myst, help out with the collection of knowledge. But the only way I can ever really understand anything enough to be confident in sealing it in formal knowledge is if it's something I fully understand. And there's still so much I don't know, so much more my mom had left to teach me." Amara held up a hand and shook her head. "No need to apologize. Really, what you've explained is more than enough. Now isn't the time to focus on whether or not the knowledge can be saved. Someday, it would be nice. But we'll just add that to the pile of other, more important reasons to save your mother, aye?" said Amara with a soft smile, earning a nod from Star, and a smile in turn. "Right," said Star in turn. "Shapeshifting apparently is one of those things you're still learning about, yeah?" asked Amelia, wearing a small smile. Not a joke, but something to lighten the mood a little. Star giggled softly, nodding again, then looked back to Ellesandra, along with the other two women. "Question for you, Ellesandra," began Amelia. "What's your high-level plan, then? We've seen that this...Valentina person can just decide to plunk us wherever they please if we try to teleport into Gurhal at least. They were able to throw a suit of armor at us that, if I didn't have Vaerix as my trump card, would have been a fight I would have sooner encouraged that we have an emergency retreat rather than fight. They are apparently approaching deity level strength. They have at least two more high-level officers," she said, not knowing that Ellesandra knew it was exactly three, and that all three had been present in the field, but one was invisible. "I can only assume that they are going to harass us, and while I'm not going to back down in the face of someone who clearly is out to do some awful things, I have to also be pragmatic about this. Even if the captain were to put out a call to the whole First Crusaders, and we certainly do make quite the mean fighting team all together, we still don't know the full capabilities of these assholes. Oh, and this curse apparently makes her immortal, so, joy, killing this Valentina woman is actually pointless even if we could. I'm invested in seeing this through at this point, because hell if I'm going to let you two run off and die and leave that on my conscience," a sentence that, when the Amelia attitude was removed, actually meant 'I have come to care about you two', even if she wasn't going to say it quite such a sappy way. "But we need to have a bigger plan in place. More than just how to navigate this behemoth plane without walking for months until you succumb to your advanced age," she said, cementing that apparently Ellesandra being old was the running joke, even though in reality Ellesandra was actually only a single year older than Amelia, and Amara was the oldest among them. "I wanna know what we're gonna do to actually beat these pricks. Because the way I see it, they won't have any trouble making this all difficult for us, and the closer we get to freeing their prisoner, the harder they're gonna fight back. And nothing will give me quite as much satisfaction as wiping that stupid, smug grin off that green haired freak's face."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra would feel bad about how it had caused pain for Star, no matter if Star wanted that or not. The regret was still there, even if it was easily pushed away and ignored while they continued on to discuss the rest of it. She'd stopped pacing as Star explained her magic, standing awkwardly for a moment but then moving to sit on the bed next to Star once it became obvious she wouldn't have to go into any more long explanations about things. Instead, she listened quietly as Star explained the connection they had, the resonance and how it was formed, as well as how her magic worked. She was glad Star did that, because honestly she wasn't sure exactly how to go about explaining it herself. She winced at the explanation of how being resonant with someone and then losing them took a part of them away, at least in Aurora. Was that what had been happening to Star when she thought that Ellesandra had 'died'? She crossed her arms, considering and wishing she'd thought to ask for hot cocoa if the tavern had it. Her nerves could really use it right now. Ellesandra wasn't normally a talker, or sharer, so sharing all of this was definitely out of her comfort zone. Not to mention that she had literally felt the pain of death less than 8 hours ago and was also wrestling with her emotions for Star, she wanted the crutch of a comfort item more than she normally did. She didn't say anything about it, shifting from crossed-arms to hands placed in her lap and squeezing together. At Amelia asking her a question, she turned her attention back to the woman and nodded. "Well, first of all, i can sense them. I don't know how I can sense them, but I could do so even before I fully signed on to travel with Star. Ever since that first dream Black Diamond visited me in. The captain, I could sense the shadow coming from him, and it was centered in the gem that was his heart. I can sense the same in all three of her lieutenants, and she'd shared with me in a dream that's all she had. Not that it isn't possible for her to have lied, but I think we'll only have to deal with three of them for now. Also, all three were there when we stepped out of the portal. Remember I said there's another behind us? Star can sense invisible people's aura, so she's covered in sensing this one, but I could tell because I could sense the shadow." Ellesandra glanced at Star, realizing only now that had been a detail she hadn't shared before. It hadn't been intentionally withheld, though. Just not something she'd deemed important at the time. "But well, we know they can't truly be wounded unless you stab them in the gem in their heart. I've been able to trace it in all three of them to ensure it is in their heart and not a different place for each one, when we were ambushed today. Well, at least the two I could see. So we won't waste attacks on stabbing them through the head like I did the first one, not knowing it wouldn't do anything." She paused, considering more. What would they do when fighting them? They were all obviously powerful, and Amelia was right that Valentina was immortal while cursed. "I somehow doubt we'll have to fight Valentina directly, so her being immortal isn't a factor hopefully. And if we do, well. Just let me touch her necklace and prevent her from killing me while I do. I can draw the curse into myself so we can kill her. Not ideal, but possible if it's absolutely necessary." Ellesandra was very pointedly NOT looking at Star when she said this. She knew damn well Star wouldn't allow that, but she felt like it was a necessary plan to share just in case. "The rest of them, I'm truly unsure. We can practice fighting together so we have different battle plans, but we don't truly know the powers of each of them. I suspect the armored knight we fought wasn't even directly the Black Emeralds - green haired freak" She clarified for Amelia. "creation. Unless they're all just aspects of Valentina herself, it would have needed to be her magic that passed the curse on to me. So, we're unsure what any of them can actually do in a fight, themselves."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"You can?" asked Star when Ellesandra mentioned they could sense the shadows. New information, for certain. She blinked, considering this. "I wonder why that is," she said more to herself. Was it just a product of how Ellesandra's magic worked? Seemed an awfully specific side effect. Amelia briefly recalled the instruction that there was another behind, and while she hadn't been sure that had been another of these 'lieutenants', that did clarify it, so she nodded. "Stab in the heart. Got it. I'm sure if we ask nicely they'll stand still while we do so," said Amara with a chuckle, hoping a little lighter tone could help keep things smooth. As if it was so simple. Then when Ellesandra spoke about taking the curse, Star's head violently whipped towards them. Ellesandra didn't need to look at Star to feel the disapproval from her. It legitimately was strong enough that Ellesandra could quite seriously feel it from their presence. Their level of resonance made stronger emotions flow more freely between them, and the close proximity and strength of emotion made it tangible for the knight. It wasn't nearly as strong for them as Star felt it, but to feel it at all made Star's stance clear. No. She understood that in an emergency, desperate measures were sometimes needed. But that wasn't okay in her books. She didn't say anything, but, well, the slightly awkward looks from Amara and Amelia as they saw the head turn fast enough to lash someone with those pretty white locks told the story. Yeah. They noticed. "Well," began Amelia again. "Sounds like we can expect to fight more of those. If not those armor suits, then more of her creations. Goodie gumdrops." She sighed through her nose. What a thing to get involved in. "So what do you suggest as the path forward? Obviously, next steps are to follow this lead to see about securing an airship. Then going to Snowhaven. And if by the grace of luck we manage that without complication, then what? I know it'll depend on what we find I suppose. But I'd feel a lot better if we started thinking two or three or four steps ahead rather than just one. Sure as the hells sounds like our enemy is doing that."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had no idea why she could feel the shadow she just assumed it was something in regards to how Valentina was in her dreams. At the comment about them standing still, Ellesandra smiled to Amelia. "Just cast hold person better." The tease back was obvious, humor in regards to how hard stabbing them in the heart would actually be. Or just somehow destroying the heart - didn't have to be stabbing. With Star's OBVIOUS disapproval, Ellesandra kept her gaze firmly away from Star's own. She knew that wasn't an option Star would accept, which - "Actually, Star. If we do have to face Valentina, you are absolutely not allowed on the field during that. Not because I'm just being protective, but Valie-bitch actively said an auramancer looking at her while she had the curse would go insane. And I know it's not just looking that would do something to you, you can still sense it." There was an unspoken implication that if, for some reason, Ellesandra had to pull the curse into herself then she would be able to be near Star, as well. "That's very important, Star. The curse involves feeling the suffering of every living person. You can not be near it." She'd heard what Amelia had said, the suggestion to figure out next steps after getting to Snowhaven, but Ellesandra wanted to wait until Star met her eyes and affirmed her understanding. She wasn't joking about this, and she turned a fully serious face onto Star with the look of ' you don't really have a choice in this.'


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was taken aback by the serious shift, and knowing the details of the curse. Amelia and Amara, too, knit their brows. They needed a moment to make sure they heard that correctly. Star, as well, had to consider that. Yes, if she was exposed to that, she could see how it would break her. That Valentina wasn't also just some comatose vegetable because of it didn't track for her. How could anyone bear that? She could think on that later, for the moment, she had to face Ellesandra. She saw the serious look. Her not being there was reasonable, given the evidence. That much didn't meet any resistance, so was met with a soft nod. "I understand. I don't know that I could run from someone like that but...If I have any choice in the matter, I'm not going to be reckless in the face of a curse that powerful." An answer that hopefully set Ellesandra at ease. Star didn't have a death wish, and she held firm on HER side of the promise of 'no death'. "...But that doesn't mean you have any business interacting with that curse, either. There'll be another way."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded. She wasn't sure how either, shaking her head. "Trust me, the small taste of it I got after drawing it into myself was enough to make me not want to, Star." Just because she didn't want to, didn't mean she wouldn't be willing to if she had to. "As a note, the curse is what broke my sword. I tried stabbing her gem and using the curse to power the sword enough to break through the curse. Didn't really, well. Work." Ellesandra looked sheepish. "I'm not sure if Valentina shattered my rapier to stop me or if the curse shattered it, but either way. For Valentina's part, she protected me form the shards of my own sword though, for some reason." Ellesandra hadn't considered why, she had no real idea. Valentina didn't seem to want her dead, but she also did if Ellesandra continued with Star. More like didn't actively want to kill her but would if she needed to? She shrugged. A hand reached out and lightly patted Star's thigh. Reassurance at Star not getting near the curse had helped ease the sudden worry that had come up, and she didn't let her touch linger for long before she'd turned back to Amelia. "Anyways, I'm not sure. We get to Snowhaven, and search for clues as to where Star's mother was taken. We know she was taken by one of Valentina's groups, so we're likely to have to fight one of the lieutenants to free her. And Valentina will likely know, since she can sense everyone's suffering and spy on them through that." Oh, shit. That was another thing she didn't mention. "So, we look for clues there, and we can probably ask about the Cult of Faust location on our way. They might be related, since Sapphire confirmed they were working together with Valentina. That or asking about general banditry and the like. If we can't find anything either through information or at Snowhaven, then perhaps we turn to finding someone with magic who might be able to perform a scry for us. Assuming neither of you can?" She asked, glancing between Star and Amelia.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Oh, is that all?" said Amelia, looking exhausted at this point. She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Anything else in your 'by the way' pile of realm-shattering revelations you'd like to share while you're at it? What does that even mean? Spy on us through suffering? So what, every time I get a papercut she's able to spy on me? Every time I'm having a shitty morning? Urrgghgh," said Amelia, huffing after her groan in case her frustration wasn't apparent enough. "Gods above this just keeps getting better the more I learn of it," she muttered to herself, then looked at Ellesandra. "Of course I can scry. Who do you think you're talking to?" she said, giving a pouty look. "Something that I'm realistically only gonna have one shot at per day, and I don't exactly carry a super expensive focus for that sort of magic in my back pocket, but if you think it'll be useful, I can ask my captain next time I see her if the Followers might loan out one of their suitably tailored crystal balls for me to carry with me," she said, then looked dryly at Amara, who just gave them a look that was all too used to their sarcasm in return. "And what the hell is up with this Cult of Faust anyway? Who is Faust, and why do they have a cult? And why is that cult helping this cursed bitch?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt like Amelia was truly speaking for the whole group with all of this. "I'm not quite sure how specific it gets, but I know she knows everything about my past. Which has not been told to anyone but Star, and she doesn't even know all of it. Valentina knows because when I suffered, apparently she did too." She shrugged. "So if you really wanna make her suffer, just stab yourself in foot every morning and call her a bitch, I guess." Ellesandra was obviously not being serious. She shook her head. "I'm not sure how much 'spying' she gets from it, considering she's also suffering for a thousand other people at the same time I'm sure, but she'll probably know stuff about all of us that we haven't shared with anyone." Well, except Star because Star was an open book, but still. "And I'll let Star explain the cult of faust, she probably knows more about them than I do?" Ellesandra asked more than said, looking at Star. "They are the cult that was in your story, no?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia looked briefly amused by the petty comment. A successful distraction from the rest of it. Star had sympathy - because of course she did - for the frustrations on display. It certainly had exploded well beyond what she thought it would. She just...Wanted to find her mom. That was it. Why did it have to be this complicated? "Safe to say that, depending on the sensitivity of it, nothing we do will be secret. Best to operate on that assumption and not rely on being clandestine," said Amara. Star gently nodded to Ellesandra passing the explanation to her. "Not exactly, but, sorta, I guess. It was never called the Cult of Faust in the stories. But in Gurhal, everyone learns of an ancient war that happened here. You can ask pretty much anyone about it and they'll remember at least part of the story, I'm sure. Some might also make reference to a concept they call 'the old suffering', which is a reference back to this war. To make a very long story short, well...There was an exceptionally evil man who rose to power in Gurhal some thousand years ago. Some evidence from ancient ruins show that Gurhal used to be a very highly advanced place prior to this war, most of which survived in Hotenz city, where there was the historic last stand of the people of Gurhal. The war was incited by and led on the side of destruction by the man, Faust. He often is referred to as the Grand Magician in this context, for he was an archmagi." This fact evoked a flick of the ears from Amelia. That word, archmagi, seemed to pique her interest specifically, but she continued to listen quietly. "The people who followed him collectively were known as the Dark Curtain. And while I'm sure it was a cult, it didn't go by that plain title. He tried and nearly succeeded in destroying all of Gurhal, promising an...Ascension of the species to godhood, to surpass even the feats of Netheril. As the story goes, the gods sent their strongest warrior, Silent Purity, to slay Faust when Gurhal was in its darkest hour. Silent Purity was what was called a Seraph. Which is just the feminine term for what most scholars call Solars, which is considered the masculine term. I know that might deviate from typical nomenclature, so just know they mean the same thing in terms of how powerful they were. There's a lot of speculative facts that I won't get into, things people disagree on with this old history. But, 'the old suffering' refers to a sort of...Collective agreement from all people in Gurhal. A promise that we must all act to prevent us from feeling that suffering again, from falling to the depths of darkness the plane once experienced. And while I've been away from Gurhal for a long time now, I can only imagine that this Cult of Faust has read into the very obviously horrible things that once happened, took the understanding of the old suffering, and perverted it to turn Faust into a martyr or something, probably trying to bring about another dark age. Though just knowing what I know about Gurhal, they will have to be extremely sneaky sorts. No sensible, reasonable person will ever associate Faust with anything good, and they'd more than likely be hunted by anyone with a decent moral compass if they truly are trying to emulate the destruction of the past."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to Amara. "So when you two make out when we aren't looking, make sure to remember that Valentina can see that." Ellesandra intentionally inserted the most off the wall thing she could think of to try to alleviate the potential depression this topic could bring up. her goal was to make Amelia - and maybe Amara? - splutter in outrage or something, just smiling a shit eating grin at the two of them. She had also perfectly timed it to try to line up with when she'd passed the baton to Star to speak, since she thought they'd be a little less likely to interrupt Star's explanation than they would if Ellesandra had been the one talking. With the conclusion of Star's rehash of Faust, she shook her head. "More powerful arch beings. Lets just hope our luck doesn't keep up and this Faust isn't resurrected or something and we have to fight him off too. I'm strong against magic users but archmages might be out of my league even still." That really did seem to be the way the damn adventure seemed to be going lately. If something bad could happen to get in their way, it did. She looked back to Amelia and Amara, serious compared to her previous statement. "It's not too late for you two to back out, if you want to." The offer felt needed, since this had grown to much larger proportions than either of them had known originally.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amara just quietly closed her eyes and shook her head at the make out comment. Amelia very obviously rolled her eyes. Was there something between the two of them? They weren't giving signals that there was, but they could be hiding it. Star probably knew, but she also wouldn't be divulging that even if asked. When the offer to back out came up, Amelia straightened her posture and folded her arms again, having been slightly leaning forward on her crossed legs for a moment. "What, just head on back to Myst to relax and read, say good luck, try not to die, which you probably will?" Amelia scoffed. "I already said you're not leaving your death on my conscience, so you're stuck with me now. Should have thought about that before bringing us along and explaining all this. You had your chance to be rid of me," she said, full of huffy attitude. Amara moved a hand to plant softly on top of Amelia's head, flattening their ears gently and rubbing back and forth. "What Amelia is trying to say is that the evidence of how dire this all is is cause for greater support, not less. Truly, if we find ourselves outclassed, it may even be worth seeking support in Myst. If we have a way to move around the realm more swiftly, if this airship plan pans out, there are powerful fighters and mages in Myst who are prepared to lay their lives on the line for what is right. Professor Yami in particular, I recall him speaking about something he did years ago, saving this young feline woman from a kidnapping and stood against exceptionally fierce resistance in doing so; it stuck with me because he spoke of how he and the allies he brought with him were like a force of nature, an exceptionally strong paladin, an assassin, a mighty fighter, he, the wizard. And yet, the enemy summoned a legion from the hells to stand against them and he ended up snapping his staff over his knee to perform a retributive blast. That selflessness made it quite the story to me, as it was a coin toss as to whether he would have been destroyed alongside the enemy. What was the name of that woman...So...Soria, no...Sophia! Yes, that was the name," said Amara, and what was a small anecdote to her evoked a bright signal of recognition in Star. "Sophia? Is that what happened to her?" she asked, looking briefly upset by this. "Goodness...I knew I should have accompanied her..." Amara was surprised to hear that Star somehow knew this, but it did serve to corroborate the story as more than just the professor boasting. Unexpected. "...Hm. Small worlds, I suppose. But, well...Given all that you have said, Ellesandra, and Star...It's my belief we should seek allies wherever we go. We never know whose talents might be needed, and with enemies like the one's who stand against us...It ought not be ruled out that our actions might incite wider conflict."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't try to read into if there was something between the two of them. She truly had been joking. When she'd first met them she'd thought there was, but at this point she wasn't so sure - nor did it really matter. When Amelia commented they'd had their chance to get rid of her, Ellesandra tasked and snapped her fingers, then slapped her thigh. "Dang." She said, mocking obvious disappointment at not being able to get rid of the sassy mage. Then she looked over to Amara as she answered a little more seriously. There was...discomfort at the idea of getting a lot of other people involved. Oh, it was 100% the right call, getting allies to help fight alongside them would likely be vital, but the discomfort came from feeling like she would be leading people to their death. Not that she'd be leading anyone, but they'd be following Star and her's lead in regards to fighting this group, and that was...concerning to her. There were multiple reasons she'd never tried to be a leader or commander at all in the military, and this type of feeling was definitely one of them. "Are you suggesting we request such assistance now? Or waiting until after we get more information and potentially gauge the enemy's power level more?" She shifted a little, glancing to Star to try to see how she felt about that. Star hadn't seemed happy with the idea of Ellesandra risking herself for her, let alone a group of strangers. She'd mostly ignored the comments about Sophia, having quickly dismissed the idea that they were talking about her Sophia. If Star knew this Sophia, she probably would have said something after seeing her memory if it was the same one, right? Or at least, she thought Star would. The idea made her frown, wondering if Sophia was okay. How long ago was this, anyways? If it was more than 3 years, she knew her Sophia wasn't the one. It hadn't been THAT long since she'd been exiled.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amara shook her head to Ellesandra's question. "The latter, certainly. There's no point bringing this to the people I have in mind when it's unknown how things will play out. Plus, the more of us there are, the more we have to focus on logistics of things. Even something as basic as relaying information can be difficult and require significant efforts that will slow us down. We need to balance our mobility with our strength. A basic tenet of any military operation applies well here, as, well, if I'm being honest, this is sounding more and more like one," she explained, highlighting that she certainly had the chops to be a military commander. Leading people to their deaths was a weight that was not easy to bear, and Star and Ellesandra certainly were calling the shots, but that didn't mean Amara's talents at rallying troops and battlefield tactics and logistics were useless. Truly, if it did expand to include a great deal of others, someone with Amara's experience would be invaluable. "My best assessment of the situation is that we will be best focused on gathering information and establishing ties with important people here in Gurhal. I think it safe to say we have earned the goodwill of Miss. Ricca, but she also has no business getting involved in this. This king...Laho, wasn't it? He might be worth speaking to. Maybe not now, but perhaps at some point. Based on all of what Star explained, this cult of Faust sounds like it needs little convincing to earn the enmity of the people of Gurhal, so I'd keep that in mind as we proceed. There'll be a delicate balance we'll have to find, because if we keep this to just the four of us, our enemy might feel less pressure, and not respond with as much force. If we rally kingdoms of entire countries behind this cause, it will escalate to a bloody war. It'll be important, I think, for the two of you to decide on operational objectives. If minimizing loss of life is paramount, it'll expose us four to greater risks due to the disparity in resources. If we seek victory by force, at any cost, then we need to be prepared for what 'any cost' may mean. Even if we achieve victory, it might be a pyrrhic one." Amara kept a very stern face about her here. She was being fully serious, where she often was softer spoken. She wasn't about to coddle either of them on this matter. "Don't feel you need to cement your thoughts on this however. We know too little, and therefore it's best we hold our conclusions until we discover more about our enemy. For all we know, this cult of Faust is fledgling and comprised of unskilled fanatics. Something best surgically excised than met on a battlefield. Until we have enough information to make such decisions, let's keep our options open." Star looked uneasy while Amara spoke. Truly...she just wanted to find her mother. Why did all this have to get in the way? Why was this all happening? Was her mother truly so important to justify being kept locked away like this? She was ignorant to too much, and it made her heart ache. It all seemed so simple, for so long. She didn't have regrets of course but...It all felt so much simpler when she was aimless and making no progress. She looked at Ellesandra, meeting their gaze. She wasn't happy. She was scared. Ellesandra would be able to feel it. The fear would not, could not shatter her resolve. She was going to see this through. She wouldn't give up. Just like Ellesandra had rightly said - Star was going to see this to the end, allies standing beside her or not. But that didn't stop fear from gripping her heart and making her want to curl up in Ellesandra's arms. The ache in her heart longed for Ellesandra's comforts; the fear bridged the path for a rise in vulnerable feelings, and those vulnerable feelings cried out for privacy with Ellesandra, while amplifying the romantic affection with a hefty dose of not wanting Ellesandra but in this moment, needing them. She kept calm on the surface, but these bubbling emotions were radiating from her, and with Ellesandra sitting right next to her, the knight could feel a muted echo of them in their own heart, and if they touched then those same feelings were just waiting to flood in full force.

Amara was smart, no wonder she was a captain. There was a bit of respect growing there, even if Ellesandra felt the way she'd corrected Amelia earlier was wrong. She nodded at what Amara said. "So lets see what's going on and if we need to involve more people. I for one would rather stay out of any war." And talking to King Laho was a good idea. Perhaps when they inquired about the airship, they could also inquire about services to the kingdom that might be beneficial to do if it was on their way in the journey. A way to increase some reputation and respect within the land, just in case they needed to come back and ask the King for assistance. He'd surely be more likely to help if they had a couple of people within the kingdom supporting them as good people, after all. Discomfort with all of this settled again in Ellesandra's stomach. That required so much interaction with people, and while Ellesandra was definitely getting more used to that again, she wasn't where she'd been four years ago. Previously, she'd been able to walk into a bar, find a cute girl, sit and chat her up - along with any of her friends. Make friends with the strangest of people. Oh, it'd all been surface level with absolutely no details, but she'd been good at being 'one of the crew'. Now? She'd gone so long with only talking when necessary, being her stoic guard self, that it felt weird even just being sassy and sarcastic back at Amelia. And they might need to interact with a lot of other people, if they needed to collect people to fight a war. She looked at Star, prepared to mention that Star should be the one doing any talking in those situations. Not only was she better with people but her auramancy would help her read the situation better. But as she turned to look at Star, she felt that fear coming from her. It was a distant, but she knew it was only distant because they weren't touching. A look of concern passed Ellesandra's face and she watched Star for a moment. And then she raised an arm and wrapped it around Star's shoulders, tugging her in for a side hug. She didn't let go after the initial squeeze, keeping her hand resting on Star's opposite shoulder, trying her best to send Star feelings of reassurance rather than the discomfort Ellesandra had with the situation. "So, next steps being travel to this fort and talk to the Father's friend about an airship. On the way, if we happen to see this beast that hurt Keiko I wouldn't mind taking it out for them, if you are all up for that. Not something I'd want to go far out of our way for, but I don't trust that the tax collector is even passing the message on if it's gone on this long. When in the fort we can keep an ear out for similar things we can do to try to raise our standing here, in case we need to come back and ask for help later, but focus our main goal on getting the airship and heading to Snowhaven. Try to oust this Faust group, or get information on where they are or where Aurora -" She paused. Had anyone told Amelia and Amara what Star's mother's name was? She didn't remember, so she clarified anyways. "Stars mother, is and see what plans we need to hatch at that time. No just running in to stage a rescue that's doomed to failure." And she squeezed Star's shoulder. "No death if we can prevent it." The words were more meant for Star than anyone. A reassurance that Ellesandra was in this mission with her. She would try not to die, even if she was okay with martyring herself if she thought it would get Star her mother back.

Star enjoyed seeing the respect building in Ellesandra. Star was happiest when everyone was getting along. Happiest when people liked each other, even if there might be differences. Of course, it was also useful for there to be mutual respect among allies. The level of respect or disagreement Ellesandra had naturally remained unknown to Amara and Amelia, but if there was one thing that could help Star feel more at ease about the dangers ahead - aside from the obvious physical comforts - it was a sense of camaraderie. Difficult times lay ahead, but if they were met with unity and conviction, then any success that was possible was all but guaranteed. And if they should succumb, then it was inevitable. Such things could not be easily portrayed in emotions, but...When Ellesandra looped an arm around Star, there was some comfort already flowing through her. Unfortunately, auramancy didn't really allow for selective transmission of emotion. It did, however, respond to emotional focus. So as Ellesandra might focus on their desire to comfort and reassure Star, those things became more pronounced in their heart, and thus more prominent as Star felt it. That discomfort was still there, however. Star still felt it. But, who could blame Ellesandra? Most people were not like Amara, who when told 'hey get ready to convince and then command an entire nation in a war' would be able to nod and steel themselves to do it. Most people would face such a daunting prospect by going a little pale in the face, maybe running for their lives. So Star didn't really think about it. She was uncomfortable for her own reasons, even if talking to people wasn't really one of them. "Aye," said Amara. "Not my favourite thing to get involved in. I'm much happier when my job is helping people build a brighter future, instead of standing against the people who are determined to make it darker," said Amara. The two seemed to pick up on who Aurora was at some point, whether told directly or just from other anecdotes. Star was comforted by the hold, and smiled at her companion. She knew the 'no death' was aimed at her; it was progress, though she still would much prefer it spoken with greater conviction. She'd take it, all the same. Amelia looked amused for some reason, probably some sassy thought floating around in her head, but she kept it to herself. "Sounds like we have a solid path forward. In the mean time, Amelia and I should secure an audience in Myst to discuss the mission and guild financials. We'll still be keeping things tight, but it's still prudent to be honest about the current perception of the threat, if only to allow for contingencies to be put in place. If that's all, we should get to that. We should return by nightfall, but if we need to be in contact, the sending coin will work across planes. Just keep in mind it only has three charges per day, so make each word count if we need to use it." Three charges was better than most items of that nature, which were good for a single use per day, but the limitations still made long conversations impossible. And if there was nothing else for the group to discuss, Amara and Amelia - with her amused grin of unknown source - set off to return to Myst.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to Amara at the confirmation they'd be heading back to Myst, at least for the time being. Holding Star like this felt...odd. She'd held Star before, cuddled her to make her feel better, hugged her. But until after she had done it, she hadn't realized how...casual and couple-y this was. How it looked. It may not have been exactly what Amelia was thinking with her internal sassy monologue, but Ellesandra assumed that's where Amelia's mind had went. She felt a little defensive, and almost said 'It's not a date' again to her, though it wasn't like they were doing anything datey anyways. As much as Ellesandra's active conscious tried to deny her interest in Star, and how her protectiveness was entirely just because of her duty and not because she truly cared for her, it was getting harder and harder to keep that lie up to herself. It didn't help, still feeling Star's affection towards her whenever they touched. Especially earlier, at the head pat. How she had wanted so badly to kiss Star. What with Amelia and Amara leaving for a while, perhaps Ellesandra should distance herself, to resist temptation? As Amelia and Amara left she considered this, hand slipping down from Star's shoulder, but not fully pulling away from her either. The battle waged inside Ellesandra and she turned her head, looking away from Star and clearing her throat. "So. Um." Was that the first time Star had ever heard her say um? Why was she so damn nervous, suddenly? She'd been alone with Star plenty of times before. And she was never nervous around women she was interested in, not since she was a wee teen with her first crushes and girlfriends. "Anything we need to do while they're gone, to prepare? Not sure if you wanted to spend any time with the locals getting news or information or anything like that." Yep. Very pointed topic to focus on, rather than letting the silence, awkwardness, or feelings grow.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It had been so natural for Star to just...Lean into Ellesandra as she had. Of course, Star was just a cuddly person. She liked to hug, to cuddle up, and even if there had not been any romantic interest between her and Ellesandra, she still would enjoy that closeness. Such was the product of her auramancy. Truly, any auramancer would more than likely be okay with casual closeness, likely even enjoy and maybe even pursue it with others. A hug didn't equate to romantic interest. Nor did a cute side-hold. But with Ellesandra, that interest was there. So even if the act in isolation meant nothing, it still had Star's heart stirring with a little bit of butterflies fluttering around in her chest. The topic at hand had dampened a lot of those emotions, but...The topic was disappearing now. And now Star and Ellesandra were...Alone. Once more, together in private, and her thoughts and gaze drifted to her companion. Her sparkling, vibrantly blue eyes looked at the woman still holding her. The nervousness she felt from Ellesandra didn't help the situation. A subtle tension began to rise in the air between them. Her lips, plush and delicate, ever so slightly trembled, then parted as if she was about to speak, but couldn't find the words. The two were still touching, of course. If not from Ellesandra hugging her, then from her leaning into them. And she WAS leaning into them. A bit more than before, even. And from that touch, Ellesandra could feel that this moment was...Dangerous. That thing they shouldn't do, according to the knight at least, was far more attractive in Star's mind than walking around talking to the locals. Star was looking at Ellesandra with tenderness and desire. She wanted...something. And it took a very deliberate yank from her mind to wrest herself away from this path, reminding herself that...Ellesandra could not be pushed into this. So Star looked forward again, easing some of her weight off them as she forcibly folded her hands in her lap over her skirt and looked at the floor in front of her. The desire had not gone away. It was still there. Still burning through her veins. But for Ellesandra's sake, she resisted that which her heart longed for. "U-Uhm," she began, still looking at the floor, face flushed. "I...I don't particularly want to do that, n-no. I can't...Think of anything that we need to do, s-specifically." Mostly because the only thing she COULD think about was laying naked with Ellesandra, hands roaming each other's bodies and kissing for hours. The flames were growing brighter on their own, but damned if they weren't also battering Star's resolve, demanding she pump the bellows and let the fire consume her entirely.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt like the tension that had just, suddenly sprang up between them could be cut with a dull butter knife. As Star pulled away, Ellesandra fully let go and scooted to the edge of the bed, creating a little bit of distance between them. She still wasn't looking at Star, at those wide blue eyes that worked so well at pulling her in. They had JUST been talking about how horrible of a task they were on and then as soon as they were alone, it felt like the only thing to do was to turn and kiss Star. Like it was inevitable, or something. Like everything Ellesandra addressed, she was going to address this head on. No need to beat around the bush, right? Ellesandra stood, going back to pacing. She was even more nervous, trying to fight off these desires and emotions, than she'd been when recapping everything that had happened to the three of them and explaining why Star had felt her die. She reached up tugging at her hair, pacing the length of the small room once, twice, thrice before she stopped and looked at Star. "Look, I -" She started, and then stopped, turning to pace again. "I would be a mistake, okay Star? I'm not blind, I see what's happening but - I'm not right for you. It's best we not do anything because of that, it'd only hurt you in the long run." She said, all of these dark thoughts that had been crowding around her feelings, reminding them to stay down. They hadn't, of course, but it didn't mean that those dark thoughts weren't still there. "I'm not a relationship person and you're not a fling person. Us trying to do anything together, meeting in the middle or - or trying a relationship would just end in disaster." Nowhere in this was she saying that she didn't want to be with Star. It would be a lie, and even if Star couldn't see her aura to tell she was lying, it would be obvious she was. She paused again, turning back to Star, and her gaze went right to those lips. The plush lips that Ellesandra wanted to feel against her own, against her neck, down... Her own blue eyes pulled away again, forcing her gaze away before she let that thought continue. "Do you understand? We - we can't go further than what we've got now. It wouldn't be right." A lame excuse, one given from years of having little self worth. From blaming herself for all the bad that had happened in her past. From not thinking she was worth anything but a good fuck here and there.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had been feeling emotional for a while, and indeed the threat of what loomed had dampened her emotions a touch. But that was all so nebulous, so far away, that it had no real grip over her. It hadn't become...'real' yet that things might turn to war or might end up escalating out of control. It was speculation. Things that could be controlled with careful planning and unity. Or so she told herself. But something that was VERY real was the way her heart burned for Ellesandra. She listened to what the knight had to say, of course. She wasn't going to interrupt them. She wasn't the sort of person to deny someone the opportunity to open their heart and feelings. Quite the opposite, she was the sort to encourage it at every step. But what Ellesandra had to say? It was just fluff. A bunch of nonsense, as far as she was concerned. Ellesandra had depths of emotion that made any attempt to say they weren't a 'relationship person' just bounce right off Star like it hadn't even been said. She'd seen them be in love, or something close. She knew what was in their heart. That didn't mean that all these words weren't valid - they still came from very real places in Ellesandra's heart. Very real grief and anguish. So she felt emboldened to speak her side of it. She stood, then boldly stepped up to Ellesandra, arms sliding up to wrap around Ellesandra's neck as she stepped flush against the knight. She wasn't pushing in for a kiss, not pushing in to make some bold, romantic motion that would somehow heal all of Ellesandra's fears and anxieties. But she was going to have her words, and her emotions, heard. Her heart was thumping heavily in her chest. Her cheeks were tinted just slightly pink. Her touch was warm and plush against Ellesandra's neck. One hand crossed over their shoulders, the other slid up to gently play with Ellesandra's hair. There was a small flash of...Not anger, but some defiant feeling that didn't like what she heard. The same feeling that made someone make a stern face. But Star didn't. She wasn't smiling, but she wasn't looking at Ellesandra with anger or admonishment. When she spoke, it was tender: "You...Could never be a mistake, Ellesandra. I'm not...Pushing you into anything. When I showed you what was in my heart in Myst, I told you, and I'll tell you again...I'm not pushing to change things. The only reason I need time to hold back from empowering our resonance further is because I know that even my own restraint has limits. And at some point, if we continued that...I know I wouldn't be able to stop myself from doing something with you I couldn't take back. It already burns within me to ask you to give me my first kiss...To give me a kiss I will never forget," she said, her voice a deeply affectionate whisper. "I know the fear you feel, I know the pain that tortures you...I know it scares you, and I know it's too confusing to be more than friends right now." She paused. She had been looking deep into Ellesandra's eyes the whole time, and kept those bright blue irises trained on the woman before her. She was being serious, in the most gentle way she could. "But don't tell me it would be a mistake. Don't tell me it wouldn't be right. And don't tell me you would hurt me...Because you've made it clear time, and time, and time again, very sternly...That you will do everything in your power to keep me from getting hurt. Even if that means suffering yourself." She wanted to seal these words with a kiss. But...She reminded herself again that now was not the right time. So...With a brief touch of her forehead to Ellesandra's, she slowly slid back from the knight. Already, from the brief moment apart, she felt cold. She missed Ellesandra's heat. She then swallowed a lump in her throat and gave a shaky exhale as she recouped her nerves from such a bold motion.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had not expected Star to come up to her. She'd frozen, still as a statue when Star stepped up, then slid arms around her neck. Her breath came out in a rush, one she didn't even realize as it felt like her soul left her body with that breath. She stared up into Star's eyes, the very slight height difference nothing when this close, really. Her eyes stayed locked on Star's, unable to look away as Star spoke. Oh, nothing she said was truly internalized. Ellesandra heard her, listened to the positive things she said, though they were heard and then not truly accepted. It wasn't intentional, it was just that her own self worth was so low that the words seemed more like the talk of a crazy person than Star telling Ellesandra how she truly felt. But the closeness, the feeling of Star's hands on her, so so close. It was intoxicating, and Star would not need the physical contact to see the desire and arousal written all over Ellesandra's face. Her eyes had dilated, dropping down from Star's own eyes to her lips again. Her neck and cheeks had become flushed, her breath coming a little ragged. It took every ounce of her willpower not to kiss Star then. Every single ounce of it not to reach up, stop her from pulling away, and pull her into a passionate, bruising kiss. She knew, consciously, that this wasn't a good idea. Even if they did pursue something, Star deserved her first kiss to be tender and loving, gentle and exploratory - not the type of bruising, passionate kiss that Ellesandra wanted to push into Star with now. The type of kiss that all but guaranteed more. And that was exactly why Ellesandra wasn't the right fit for Star. She didn't know HOW to do the gentle, tender kisses. Didn't know how to hold Star with the tenderness Star was showing her right now, the forehead to her own, and then pulling away. The only thing she knew would be how to make Star squirm beneath her. Or on top of her. Or against the wall - any way that Star or her wanted at the time. But the gentle, loving touches? Ellesandra was completely out of her depth with. And so, she'd held herself back. When Star pulled away, she took in a deep, shuddering breath. She'd been holding her breath that whole time, not even realizing it. Looking away from Star, towards the bed, the wall of the room, anywhere but her, she muttered. "Sorry." Her voice came out lower than normal. Husky. With the desire that was completely unhidden at this point. "I'm...perhaps I ought to take a shower before we settle in for dinner?" Or maybe take turns at showers. She didn't know how Star felt, but she knew she needed an ice cold shower right now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wanted so much more than she knew she could have in the moment. She felt the desire met ounce for ounce, cinder for cinder, and fantasy for fantasy. Would Ellesandra listen if she asked, perhaps begged, to be kissed? To be made love to? She wanted those things. But she was not ruled by her emotions. At least, within reason. Everyone had breaking points, and Star knew that her own was cresting the periphery of her heart. "Don't apologize," she said back, pausing to bite her lower lip. "Just...Makes me feel defensive of you when someone says cruel things about you. Even if the person who seems to be doing that the most is, well...You." She gave a soft, understanding smile. "I need a cold shower, too, uh...When you're done, of course," she said, blushing harder and with a slight shrink of her posture, knowing that was just a coy way to admit how turned on she was. And that her pointed clarification hinted that she was fantasizing about showering with Ellesandra.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra's heart...ached. Ached at being denied what she wanted so badly. She'd held herself back from desire before, had to fight off the desire to kiss someone or how horny she'd been in many situations before. There was only one time before that she felt like she'd had to hold back her heart, like she was doing now. That had been Marigold. The difference was, she realized as Star bit her lip and all but admitted to being turned on as well, that Star was interested in her in return. She wasn't...unobtainable, in that she was straight and a princess and far above Ellesandra's true station as an orphan. She was unobtainable, but only because Ellesandra thought she was. Thought that she would do nothing but hurt her. And even though she still thought this, she found herself stepping up to Star. Her hand came out and cupped Star's cheek, fingers curling around the back of her neck and thumb gently caressing her. Her other hand was clenched, Ellesandra giving in to the need to touch Star, but not fully. She closed her eyes, just feeling the heat of Star's blushed, smooth skin on her calloused hand. "I can't give you what you need, Star." She whispered, the pain evident in those words. The pain spreading from her heart. The poison of Marigold's death, and how Ellesandra truly, without a single moment of doubt, believed it was her fault. The pain of thinking she would never deserve someone like Star, and that Star deserved so much better than her. Ellesandra pulled her hand away quickly as that settled in, as if touching Star somehow burned her, and then made her way to find the shared shower quickly. She didn't think to bring clothes with her, didn't think to bring anything - she just retreated, escaping before Star could comment on the pain she surely saw, or the tears that had appeared last second in her eyes. The pain had sprung lose, and she no longer had the mountain to hide it behind. So she'd hide, physically, in the shower.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was taken by mild surprise when Ellesandra cupped her cheek. She sucked in a breath, her eyes went a little wide...But the acceptance was both visible, and felt between them. It would be impossible to deny the simple truths that Star enjoyed that feeling, enjoyed Ellesandra touching her like this in general, and that she wanted more. Mental gymnastics could go to work justifying that even if Star liked it now, it would still be pain in the long run, whatever Ellesandra's mind might need to do to bridge the dissonance that screamed at both of them that it was right to embrace this moment. But no amount of denial could stand against the purity of Star's acceptance. And when Ellesandra spoke, declaring they couldn't give her what she needed, the flash of defiance came back. Her soft expression hardened a little. But she didn't respond with aggression. She could not beat Ellesadra's pains into submission. They required a nurturing touch, and so, she stepped into Ellesandra again and threw her arms under their shoulders to wrap around them. She put her head to the side of theirs, resting the side of her head on theirs, so they didn't have to look each other in the eyes again and fight quite so hard to not kiss each other. But the tighter hold did mean that Ellesandra would feel the thudding of her chest against theirs as her heart raced. "You can," she said, firm and resolute. "I don't know what the future holds, Ellesandra...But so long as you will walk beside me, I will fight against that fear that grips you and tells you that you're not good enough. Because I know it is so, so very wrong. I could not love someone whose heart was filled with malice. But every time I look into your eyes I become more and more sure that what I feel in my heart could truly blossom into love. And I have no reason nor desire to fight that."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra should have expected that Star wouldn't just let her go. But she didn't, and the hug she was given rooted her to the spot. She held very still, not returning it but just standing there as...as Star confessed she was falling love with Ellesandra. "No" the word came out abruptly. Denial at Stars feelings, even though through their touch she could feel them. Even though she knew what Star said to be true, and how her own feelings responded in the same exact way. This time though, panic rose and completely overshadowed them. "You can't. You - I - I'll just hurt you. I - no, no you can't be." The panic was so much that she actively tried to pull away from Star. Pull out of the hug, take steps back, create distance. Her eyes were wild, as if those words had set her into a fight or flight mode. With most people she'd fight, but with Star the only option she had was to flee. Even in this panicked state, she couldn't bring herself to snap at Star and try to push her away. "You're mistaken, Star. A first crush. That's all it is. Infatuation with someone who likes you too. You can't be falling for me." Unspoken, the words that had echoed in her mind ever since Marigold had firmly rejected her love - even if she hadn't known it at the time. Ellesandra was unlovable, at least romantically. She wasn't the love type. She had nothing going for her as a longterm partner. An orphan, a disgrace, an exile, a murderer - no one could love someone like her. Not really. The pain gripped tighter at her heart as tears began to fall. "It's not...possible"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Perhaps one of the most beloved aspects of auramancy by Star was that when someone said something out of a knee-jerk response, out of a burst of feelings, and didn't truly mean it...She couldn't be hurt by it. She could see through the lie. Ellesandra's lips said no, but their heart said yes. Their heart also was screaming at the top of its lungs, but one thing at a time. Star didn't resist Ellesandra's push out of the hug. She wasn't going to wrestle them onto the bed or something. If they needed space, they needed space. She wasn't hurt by that, but...She was hurt by simply seeing how torn up Ellesandra was about this. How vehement their denial had to be to guard their heart from pain. It brought tears to Star's eyes. Not enough to make her cry outright, but they still pooled in the corners of her eyes and made those bright blue irises misty. "If there's one thing you are going to challenge me on...Emotions should not be your first choice," she said, trying to find a way to express to the other woman the absurdity of her saying 'you're wrong' without being mean about it. "I've met a lot of people in my life, Ellesandra. I've met kind-hearted people. I've met beautiful people who had a physical allure that they flaunted to maximum effect. I've had people give me bedroom eyes and back me up against a wall with a hand on the wall by my head and seduction in their voice as they made a move on me. I've seen people who are admirable on the battlefield, people who are generous and benevolent, evoking goodwill in every life they touch. And my heart stirred for none of them." Her brows were gently knit as she spoke, as always, right from her heart. "...It started as infatuation, yes. When I first saw you, I saw the guilt, I saw the pain you felt. You still selflessly came to my aide. I thought you were a beautiful woman, of course. But it wasn't until I spent more time with you, saw you for who you were beneath all that pain you feel, not until you opened up about yourself, your past...It wasn't until I saw how uncompromising you are in caring for others, how you won't allow others you care for to suffer. It wasn't until I saw how effortlessly thoughtful you are, how in every small thing you do I can plainly see, as beautiful and vibrant as a sunlit meadow, that you're thoughts are with others. With me." She paused, sniffling just once. She wasn't crying still, but this was, obviously, emotional for her. "It wasn't until the one night we slept near one another in your tent, and I had dreams of laughing with you and dancing in the sun, that I could tell that it was more than just admiration, more than just attraction, more than just thinking you're pretty and nice and...Whatever else. It wasn't until my hand started to feel cold when it was separated from yours that I knew my heart was stirring for you. But even then, I was patient. I dare not act recklessly on feelings so important, for it would be unfair to both of us if I had. So I sat with them. I let them live in my heart, and I let it flow naturally either to fizzling out if it was untrue, or sparking to something more if it was genuine. And then, when I saw a flicker of the same emotion in you, and you rejected that, too, I...I lost control of myself because of...So many reasons that I can't even begin to explain it all to you now. And instead of thinking I'm just some...Freak who is gonna blow up if you make me mad, you cared for me. You looked after me. You gave me limitless compassion and put your own fears and doubts and troubles aside for what I needed most. And every moment I spent near you, then, my heart beat stronger, and harder. And every single waking second since that first flicker of infatuation, what I've felt for you has only grown stronger." She paused, her hands balled into fists at her side, trembling. "I've n-never...Never felt this way before. That's true. But just because an emotion is new does not mean I don't know what it is. It does not mean I haven't let it sit and live inside me so I could understand it, accept it as part of who I am, and embrace all that that brings with it. On the contrary I...Have never been more sure of anything in my life, Ellesandra. I dare not call it what it isn't. And I might not have a name for what it is now, exactly. But I know without a single shred of doubt in my mind that I'm slowly but steadily falling in love with you."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was firm in denial. It wasn't logical, the way she was feeling right now. That could be obvious from the fact she'd told an Auramancer that she didn't know how she'd felt. That she'd told Star she was wrong about her own feelings. It still didn't change the panic or the thought, though. Ellesandra was not in a logical state of mind at all. She sat on the edge of the bed, hard, and stared down at the floor. She heard the words Star said, though many of them just went in one ear and out the other. Her chest heaved, breathing heavily in her panic, and the rest of what had been that mountain - the guilt - tumbled into her. All of the things Star said about her, all of the 'good' she saw in Ellesandra, Ellesandra did because she felt like she owed it to Marigold. She helped people because she owed it to Marigold to make other people's lives better, since she hadn't been able to save Marigold. She valued anyone and everyone over her own life, own self, because to her - she was the darkest stain on the world already. She had caused Marigolds death, had let her walk into the bandit camp for her. Hadn't stopped her. And later, failed to rescue her. Star had helped Ellesandra with a lot of that mountain. The grief of her death, the pain of losing someone she loved, but they had hardly touched the pile of guilt that glued all of the mountain together. How it had made the grief and the rejection of love so much worse, feeding the darkness inside of that mountain. And now, the guilt was hitting her full force. Every thing Star said that she did, that made Star fall in love with her, she didn't think she did because she was a good person. She began to sob, fingers digging into her thighs hard enough to bruise - even though it wasn't a conscious thing to try to hurt herself. It was the type of ugly, loud sobbing that someone who couldn't control their emotions had, couldn't control how overwhelming and strong they were. Her head was bent over her legs and the panic turned into a full fledged pain. She didn't respond to anything Star said, didn't have the faculties to right now. The reveal that Star had shared, at least in some way, the dream of dancing in the field and sun with her that night wasn't even recognized. The reinforcement that Star was truly falling in love with her fell on deaf ears, because everything Star said was a person Ellesandra didn't feel like she actually was. It was the person Ellesandra played at being to assuage her guilt and try to atone for her sins.


</p>

Star was an honest person to a fault. She could lie, of course. But that was reserved for her enemies. People she did not trust. There was no hiding anything from Ellesandra. But it seemed that wasn't always going to result in the best outcome. She couldn't really say she expected Ellesandra to cry like this over her admission. But she hadn't been lying about her feelings, so there was an immediate need to go to Ellesandra and comfort them. She moved to them, kneeling in front of them as they began to break down. She saw it in them before it manifested, naturally. The rising guilt. The feeling of being an imposter. As it grew stronger in the woman, she moved to try and stop it from festering in them. She took Ellesandra's hands, not caring if they squeezed her own too hard. She'd rather her own hands get a little crunched than Ellesandra bruise themselves. She looked up at them from her posture on her knees, eyes now flowing with tears of her own. "N-No, no no, don't cry, Ellesandra, please.." she pleaded, her own panic now rising in response. Not just because this was unexpected and difficult, but also because she was now touching them, and from that came feeling their panic more directly, even if it was still plain which panic was her own and which was Ellesandra's. She attempted to put both of Ellesandra's hands together so she could hold both with one of her hands, so the other could move up and cup Ellesandra's cheek and rub at their tears with her thumb. "Shhh...Ellesandra, no...Where is all this coming from..?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra did not have 'Star telling her not to cry' on her bingo card for their arrival in Gurhal. If anything, Star was usually the one encouraging her to let out her emotions, to cry, to feel them, to try to comfort her through them. The fact that suddenly, Star was telling her not to cry was an inconsistency that, in the back of her mind far beyond current conscious thought, made some internal part of her pull back and go 'huh?'. That was so far clouded over by the guilt that surged into her though, that she so much didn't think anything Star said was the real her, that she'd somehow fooled Star so well that Star had fallen in love - or was falling - with the her she was being to try to atone. That the guilt was fully manifesting now, mostly in regards to the guilt for Marigold's death, but the guilt for 'fooling' Star mixed into that. When Star took her hands, she did squeeze. Ellesandra wasn't the type of strong that could crush Star's hands accidentally though, especially not in her right hand. Star would feel an obvious difference in the strength of the squeeze between Ellesandra's right and left. That didn't mean it wasn't still uncomfortable though, and might hurt a little. Ellesandra didn't even notice, and talking to her while she was ugly crying was just - how did Star expect her to respond at all to this? She wanted to pull Star in and just cry into her shoulder, like she had the night she'd broken down and processed, at least a little of the grief of Marigold's death and the romantic rejection. But now, she didn't feel like that was an option. She felt like she'd betrayed Star, with this 'act'. No matter that it wasn't an act, that while she probably gave up some of her own desires more than she would in the past in order to please someone, all of the main actions Star had mentioned she would have done even before Marigold's death. Stepping in to protect Star, sharing food that Star liked with her, protecting Lissana. The main difference was she probably would have accepted at least some of the money as payment, but beyond that - most of her actions were still her own. She just didn't feel like they were. So, she sobbed. She didn't try to answer. And after a few moments, feeling Stars hands on her face and wiping away the tears, she reached out and grabbed Star's clothing and tugged her forward. Directly into the hug that she wanted, even if she didn't feel like she deserved it, and tucked a snotty, tear-filled face into Star's neck. She was reaching out for the comfort she needed, which was progress, even if she wasn't telling Star why. Star would need to give her more time to push through this before that could even start as a conversation.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Panic. Panic was what made her tell Ellesandra not to cry. She wasn't exactly an expert in confessing feelings to someone else, but 'they break into and ugly cry' was not what she expected. But once that settled, once the pain of seeing someone she was falling in love with cry had passed, once she felt Ellesandra's heart and what came from it, understanding followed. Ellesandra wasn't crying because of some ??????? reason that was somehow Star's fault. This was something Ellesandra needed to let out. When she was hugged, she had a brief moment of surprise while everything was clicking into place. But after that moment, she gently eased herself up from a kneeling posture, still awkwardly trying to keep close to Ellesandra, then pushed forward to gently push them both onto the bed properly, with Star laying on top of Ellesandra initially, then rolling so they were laying on their sides, laying the wrong way across the bed. There, she pulled Ellesandra against herself, legs tangled up, and tucked their head into her chest. One hand smoothing over their back, the other sliding through their hair. She didn't say it, because Ellesandra didn't seem like she was in much of a talking mood, but the posture spoke for her. A sentiment of 'never mind, cry your heart out, I'm here for you'. Confusion now gone, she just was there to quietly cry alongside Ellesandra and whisper sweet, comforting nothings to them.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra molded into the position Star encouraged. She didn't resist at all as she was pushed back on the bed, even the wrong way, or when Star moved to cuddle side by side rather than on top of her. Ellesandra's hands clutched at Star's back, a tighter hold and cry than the last time she'd done this. Star would be able to feel the small amounts of comforts that she was giving Ellesandra. Holding her, being there or Ellesandra to hug, the petting of her hair - it was all the right thing to do, and even if Ellesandra wasn't actively noticing or feeling the comfort, too overwhelmed with her crying, it helped. She didn't cry so hard for long. It was only a few minutes before the sobs slowed to the point that they were more controllable, manageable in a way that wasn't totally ugly crying. She didn't pull away from Star though, hiding her face as tears still rolled down from her face into Star's outfit or neck, the sniff of someone who now had a blocked nose from crying. "I'm sorry." The words came out, the apology, but it wasn't just for crying on her suddenly. That was a big part of it, a bit of shame at having broken down like this again and so suddenly this time, but she was also sorry for having mislead Star. "I'm not...I'm not any of those things, Star." She whispered, her voice ragged from the crying so it came out in a rough whisper at best. "I didn't mean to - to fool you."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could feel the small comforts she provided. She could feel what did feel good and what didn't do much, and it just reinforced the things that worked. She held Ellesandra close, she kept them near her. She would be there for them without hesitation. But when Ellesandra spoke, saying they weren't those things, that they fooled her, Star had to resist the urge to sigh. Stubborn, stubborn emotions...She responded by moving her head just back far enough so she could move one hand between them, curl her index finger, and use it to gingerly pull Ellesandra's head up so they could look each other in the eyes. Star's eyes were misty, but she had the faintest smile on her lips. "...And just what makes you think you're capable of fooling me about that?" she said, her smiling growing a little more. "You have to know by now that I can tell when someone is lying...Even to themselves. Maybe...Especially when it's to themselves. What ever could make you feel like you've somehow deceived me about who you are, deep inside?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra couldn't meet Star's eyes when she tried to pull away to look into Ellesandra's. She just looked away, her jaw clenched to try to hold back the few tears she could. And as soon as Star allowed it, she ducked her head down against her chest again, away from the focused eyes peering literally into her emotions. Star might be making sense to most people, knowing that Star was literally able to see that, but Ellesandra wasn't in her normal mindset right now. She shook her head, disagreeing with Star. "No I - all those things I -..." She gulped. "It's my fault, she died and I...I have to make other's lives better. To make up for, for..." The words 'failing her' were in her mind, but she couldn't say them. She choked on another sob, her hands clenching and bundling up the back of Star's clothes. It took a moment, but when she pushed all of that down again, that renewed pain and grief at her loss and the guilt that was still overwhelming right now, she continued. "That isn't...really who I am. Was. I...I'm not good like that, Star." It was survivor's guilt at the worst. Feeling like she had to live for both her and Marigold, that she had to make the decisions Marigold would have made. That she could help people, to make their lives just a little bit better to atone for taking Marigold's away from her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star let Ellesandra run away and hide against her chest again when they needed to. Okay, fine, you can stay down there. But that just meant more playing with their hair. Star wasn't going to let them get away from her affection that easily, darn it. She then listened, and Ellesandra would be able to certainly feel how exactly none of those words were making Star feel convinced. Perhaps the woman might have expected Star to suddenly feel guilty, or wronged, or deceived. But no. Star just felt...Overwhelming sympathies for Ellesandra. "...It would mean a lot to me if you could recount that for me, sometime. What exactly happened." Those words did come with a bit of doubt in Star's heart. Doubt at the words, that this was somehow Ellesandra's fault. She believed, without knowing the details, that it was likely there might have been things Ellesandra might have been able to do differently with the benefit of hindsight, but who couldn't? But she recalled that Ellesandra told her there had been an ultimatum given. "But all that aside...I still don't believe you. I don't believe for one second that if she was still alive, that you'd somehow be some...Selfish, arrogant person. That you wouldn't have done what was right all those times. All of what happened to you has affected you, doubtlessly...But even if I know you're not someone who really likes being in debt to people, that much was obvious with how much of a fuss you put up against being given a new sword, some belief that you have to make up for a past wrong isn't what makes you a good person. Carrying such grief in the first place is a testament to the depths of your compassion...But even without that, I have felt you down to your deepest self. When we were in that field of flowers in those pretty white dresses together, with all the difficult realities of the world stripped away...I didn't find some hateful or selfish person. I found a beautiful woman who...Under all of these torturous feelings...Is more than worthy of love. No mistakes...No deception. You can tell me, and you might even believe it yourself when you do, that you aren't a good person...But it sounds as strange to me to hear that as I'm sure it would to you if I said the same. I'm not saying you aren't hurt...I'm AM saying that your pain does not define you or dictate the path you walk."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. Star was saying all the right things, she just couldn't...accept it. She couldn't actually internalize it. She squeezed Star harder for a moment, then glanced up to her eyes only briefly. Long enough to realize the closeness and, completely inappropriately, the desire to kiss her lips came back. This was less the lust and desire she'd felt earlier, and more just...wanting that intimacy. That was...random and definitely not appropriate with how teary and snot-stained her face was. She quickly ducked her head back down, pressing her forehead into the crook of Star's neck and taking in a deep breath. "I wish....i wish I could believe that, Star." She did. She wished she could truly believe that it wasn't her fault, but... She shook her head. She didn't think sharing those particular memories with Star was a good idea. They held way too much pain, and she knew how Star still felt the pain in them. How Star would feel the whips as they hit Ellesandra. She wasn't about to share that memory and subject Star to it. But she also couldn't speak of it. Even thinking about verbalizing what happened made her sick to her stomach. "You'll just have to trust me." She whispered softly.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star noticed the desire for the kiss. That made her cheeks heat up a tiny bit, because even if Ellesandra was snot-nosed and puffy eyed, they were still beautiful in her eyes. Still just as worthy and desirable to kiss. It passed as soon as it came - if they weren't going to kiss earlier, when the tension had her heart feel like it was pounding blood that was half composed of pure adrenaline through her body, they weren't going to now. She was stilly playing with their hair, finding it delightfully enjoyable to do so, though the moment still kept her mood lowered. "I do trust you, Ellesandra. With my life," she said quietly. "But that doesn't mean I'm not going to call you out on being wrong. And that I don't have my suspicions that you might be being just a tiny, teensy bit unduly hard on yourself. It's not like I don't understand how you could come to feel that way of course...I still cling to feelings and bear responsibility for what happened in Snowhaven. As if I could have done anything as a young girl to change the outcome. Not that it's the same situation of course but...I know how prickly and dangerous survivor's guilt can be. Feeling like it would have just been better if I had died that day. I know how that feeling can gnaw at you and skew your perception. Like I said I do trust you...I don't know the circumstances of what happened. But I do know YOU. And those two intuitions aren't telling the same story."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra leaned her head into the hair petting. It was truly one act that she really enjoyed, and there was no hiding it. Even though 'enjoying' wasn't really the right word for it right this moment, it still helped. It comforted, and that was what it was intended for right now. The words about her being unduly hard on herself, about how survivors guilt could change your perception, all of that just made her shake her head again though. There was...a little bit of frustration at Star's refusal to believe her. Her refusal to see how bad Ellesandra was, at core. Her refusal to validate all the years of self doubt and feeling like she didn't deserve to walk this world anymore. "No, Star. It was my f.." The tears came again at this. She cut herself off and buried her face deeper into Star's neck. The memory of the whip biting into her back, of the King standing above the crowd that had gathered and declared that if Ellesandra didn't fix condemning her in front of the crowd. In front of everyone she knew, who had depended on her. She choked her sob back down, shaking her head against Star. "My fault." She finished quietly. Her body was trembling, but she wasn't crying. Her hands shook, shoulders tense from the effort of not letting herself break down again.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wasn't going to believe Ellesandra unless she saw for herself proof that very staunchly contradicted what she had seen for herself. It would take a lot. She wasn't an unreasonable person. But she also knew what made people tick, what peoples' hearts did and how they responded to things. It would be quite an earth-shattering resolution indeed if she was shown proof that Ellesandra was, in fact, an awful person at their core. But she simply could not fathom how such a thing could exist. Mostly because, at least as she saw it, it just wasn't possible. "I'm not going to fight you, Ellesandra," she said gently. "But I'm also not going to just take your word for this. It's obviously a very important part of...A lot of things, to you. So I owe it to both of us to see it for myself before I agree or disagree with you. I know that probably sounds a little harsh, and I need you to trust me when I say it's not meant to be. But I truly believe you'd do the same for me. And you might be a little harsh about it," she said with a smile. "At least, you might have been when we first met. But I feel like these days, you might hold yourself back from that sternness that was drilled into you around me. Don't think I haven't noticed how you've softened up towards me," she said, squeezing Ellesandra a little tighter. "It makes me happy."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head at Star seeing it. There was a quick shot of panic again, and concern for Star at the idea. "No, it's - I don't want you to go through that. You really don't deserve that, Star." She protested immediately. It had been bad enough going through it herself. She wasn't about to let Star go through it and be scarred by it as well. Star did not deserve to experience Ellesandra's punishment. And when she added the bit about how Ellesandra had softened up a bit around Star, she grumbled a little. "Have not." A childish refusal, one that was meant more for keeping face than it was serious or honest. She knew she'd softened up to Star, had begun letting her in. That was obvious. It did not mean she was about to admit it, though.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled again after the childish refusal. She gently shook her head, then slowly moved to pull both hands onto Ellesandra's cheeks and bring them up to look at her, cupping both cheeks. "I've long since been able to separate myself from the emotions of memories. It's not that it won't affect me. But I'll be okay. You mean so much more to me than any temporary pain might, even as bad as I expect it'll be. You'd do the same for me. I know you would," she said, gently rubbing at one of Ellesandra's cheeks. She gently laid her forehead against theirs again. "...Please don't panic but...I can't help but need to tell you that I just...Really want to kiss you."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked up into Star's eyes when Star took both cheeks. She didn't really have much choice this time, but even then she just enjoyed her face being held. She bit her lip, shaking her head even while being held at the temporary pain. "Star..." She disagreed, not wanting to subject her to that. Not wanting to make her feel both the emotional, and physical pain that Ellesandra had gone through when that happened. Ellesandra was here to protect Star, not force her to live through that. All of that went out the window when Star pressed their foreheads together and verbalized what they'd both wanted to do most of the night. To kiss. Even with Ellesandra's face being all tear-stained and there still being snot she was trying not to draw too much notice to. Even with all of this, she was sorely tempted to lean in and kiss Star. She seriously considered it, but with all of the emotions roiling in her, the pain that was still there - even if more numb now - and the guilt, and the fear that she'd hurt Star. It was all there, even if it was all numb right now from all the crying. And it held her back from making the move. She stared down at her lips for a moment, but then turned her head up. Her lips pressed into Star's forehead instead. A soft, gentle kiss to the center of her forehead, one which she tried to share her affection, while maintaining a completely failed boundary of 'friendship'. "I want to too." She admitted, but shook her head. It wasn't the right time. Not when she was like....this.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star met the kiss on the forehead with a flourish of affection blossoming in her heart that could be felt through the connection between them. Hearing the words that Ellesandra wanted it too, she looked at them with a bashful smile. Her cheeks burned some more, but she was just...Happy. Very happy. And in return, she did the gesture right back. Head raised up, lips pressed to their forehead, and she tenderly kissed the soft flesh under her lips. Her lips were warm. Soft. Just the tiniest wetness, and a subtle heat to her kiss. "This is what I mean by just...Letting the feeling live," she said softly, then moved her hands from Ellesandra's cheeks to around their neck again, some more playing with their hair. "If it's okay with you I just would like to...Cuddle with you for the rest of today. I admit I...Was tempted to stay in Myst longer just so we could be together like we were longer. Obviously the quest takes priority but...I feel the need to have a little greed about the time we get together." Another soft blush and tender smile as she looked to the side. "...Have you...Still been having nightmares? When we've been sleeping together? E-Er...Uh. You know what I mean..."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had bene trying to compromise between the kissing that they wanted to do, and what she thought was safe to do. She was very wrong. When Star returned the kiss to her forehead, her heart did a somersault. She felt her affection flame up, but then with all the feelings that were active right now it just made her more conflicted than even before. She closed her eyes, trying to focus on Star's touch to her hair and neck rather than the turmoil within her or how Star was admitting she just wanted to be close. "We've only got one bed tonight, of course we're cuddling." She said this very offhandedly, as if she were trying to use the one bed as an excuse rather than it being something she truly wanted. She did want it - especially after this - but that didn't mean she was ready to fully admit how much she wanted it. Admitting she'd wanted to kiss Star was a bit further than she'd expected to go, but she still wasn't comfortable pushing that comfort boundary. As for nightmares, she shook her head. "While in Myst, Valentina couldn't reach out to me in my dreams so she wasn't able to induce nightmares. And then, other than that...no, I haven't. I think my dreams have tried, but..." She paused, not sure how to explain it. It was like Star being there, next to her, influenced her dreams not to turn into the dark way they normally did. She ended on - "They've been pulled away from the normal nightmares. Which I'm thankful for."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star quietly smiled to herself after pulling away from the kiss. It was somewhat strange...They both wanted to kiss, they were cuddling intimately, far more so than the friendly cuddles she'd shared with others in the past since her body naturally desired that intimacy with Ellesandra, they were kissing each other on the forehead now...But they were just friends. Their mutual attraction was just whittling away at that designation. They had clear boundaries that they weren't crossing, despite both obviously wanting to. But it was turning into a game of skirting around those boundaries, doing anything that didn't directly breach them, while still trying in vain to satisfy these desires for one another. And in Ellesandra's case, apparently, denying that she wanted it. Star could tell what the truth was but...There was no good to come from calling them out on how they were lying to themselves. She just found it cute, the same way she did with Amelia. Must be why they butt heads so naturally, she thought. Hearing that Ellesandra wasn't having nightmares, she smiled and squeezed a little more tightly. "Good. It makes me feel good to know you get to sleep peacefully. I'm not actively doing anything about that just to be clear just...Even in my sleep I know I'll feel protective of you, so...Just one way I'm happy to be able to comfort you. I'm glad it helps." A sentiment that didn't need to be explicitly said - Ellesandra would feel the happiness at hearing how Ellesandra was sleeping better the moment they said it. But that was an interesting nuance to auramancy. Were emotions best left unsaid, but felt, as they were most purely understood when doing so? Or was it still best to say some things out loud? Star couldn't answer such a question definitively. What she could do, however, was keep stroking her fingers through Ellesandra's hair. "Did you...Want to take that shower now? Clean up, get comfy..?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Yeah well, Ellesandra was really good at lying to herself. She was still telling herself it was her fault, and that she was not worthy of being in an actual relationship with Star. So, she'd hold back form her real desires, even if they were returned in full. The happiness she felt from Star was something Ellesandra tried to ignore. Not only because she felt uncomfortable still just feeling what Star felt - as consensual as it was that Star was happy to share those feelings or not - but also because the happiness felt...intimate. And Ellesandra was trying to pretend there was no intimacy. They were totally just friends. [They were roommates! vine vibes] At the suggestion to go shower, she nodded - but didn't move. The comfort she was getting from Star petting her hair was too much for her to want to move. She wanted to just curl up into Star and go to sleep, despite being hungry and definitely needing a shower now that she'd sobbed all over Star. None of those added up to the unspoken desire she had to just keep being petted, to feel Star's fingers running through her hair so gently. "I'll go soon" She muttered, not even sure if it was true or not. She knew she should go soon. But this position - she didn't want to leave.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled softly. "Soon, then," she echoed. There was another little burst of happiness, and a little stirring of fire in her chest. One didn't lie to themselves about their desires around Star and expect to get away with it. Or if they did expect that, rude awakenings or doubling down on denial and some Olympic level mental gymnastics were in order. Still. Star was glad to keep Ellesandra close. To just relax with them and feel the intimate closeness. She could just lay like this all day until it was time to sleep, though at some point she imagined their two allies would come back and possibly stumble upon them like this. Not that she cared, but she could just imagine Amelia writing down the definition for 'projection' and wax-stamping it to Ellesandra's forehead after the knight had accused Amelia and Amara of making out when others weren't looking. An amusing mental image that had a rise of amusement in her heart proportional to it. Auramancy did result in a lot of incidents like that. Just some seemingly random emotion flaring up for no discernable reason, with no way to know what caused it without asking. But moving on from that, Star got another idea. "Say, Ellesandra...Do you know how to braid hair?" She assumed they did, but better to lay the foundation of truth first before moving on to what she really wanted to ask.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra wasn't lying with the intention of fooling Star, at least not about this. She was lying with the intention of fooling herself. Telling herself that spending five more minutes cuddling against Star was totally something friends could do, that it didn't change their relationship dynamics at all. When Star asked about braiding hair, she pulled away just enough to look at Star with a confused expression. "I...do, why? Braiding eachother's hair doesn't exactly sound like something we should do prior to showering." Her mind immediately went to the action of asking such a question, what would immediately come after. Of course that was an assumption, Ellesandra didn't actually know what Star was going to be doing with this information. There was immediate trepidation to this idea in general, considering only one person had ever braided Ellesandra's hair - well, other than she herself doing it.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was really only one reason someone might ask if another can braid hair, and that was, well, to braid some hair. But Star gently shook her head. "Not before showering silly," she said with a giggle. "But if you remember that vision I showed you of me as a child, well. I used to wear my hair like that. Twin braids. Mom used to do it for me. Since I got separated I...Haven't really wanted anyone else to do that for me. Never wore my hair that way. But...I still have the two ribbons that my mom used to braid my hair that morning. And, uhm...W-Well...If you're comfortable with it, I'd like it if you could do that same twin braid for me." She likely could do it herself, but this wasn't just some hair thing. Star was, always had been, and likely always would be, a deeply sentimental person. Given the history, her asking Ellesandra to do this was far more than just her making a fashion statement.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra thought back to the memory Star shared of her mother and her and talking about the squirrel. The twin braids had been cute on Star, though Ellesandra wouldn't tell her that. She tried to remember what she could about the braids, if they were just basic braids or had anything special about them. Just basic braids and some ribbons in them. Her eyebrows scrunched up in concentration as she thought back, bringing the image to mind before nodding finally. "Yes, i can do that." Because that's what friends did, right? They braided eachother's hair and did girl night things together. This was just a girl night. A cry over trauma, hug and comfort one another, kiss forehead, and braid hair. TOTALLY what happened with girl nights. She'd done most of this with Marigold before. She hadn't kissed Marigold's forehead, or vice versa - and she also hadn't broken down into ugly cries in front of her, and she also...she shook her head, breaking the logic that was destroying her lie to herself. With a deep breath, she began to pull away and extract herself from Star's arms. "I should go shower quickly then, and I'll see about getting us food while you shower. Then after we eat I can braid your hair. You want them in the twin braids, or braided otherwise now?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could see the conflicts swirling around in Ellesandra, but she said nothing to them. Truly there was some degree of this that would qualify as being just friends. She would happily braid Amelia or Amara's hair, just something to do, gush about how nice their hair was in over-the-top ways to lift up their spirits. But Star was also not in denial like Ellesandra, and knew that all of what they were doing was very much beyond friendship. Which she liked. Very much so. But also knew that pointing that out was just going to lead to more denial and tears. She smiled. "There's no rush, you know," she said, offering another smile as Ellesandra extracted themselves. But at the question, she put on a thoughtful expression. She wanted to share this with Ellesandra because it was a sign of deep, intimate trust to her. But there was also an opportunity here.. "I'd like it if you did something with my hair that is..." She pursed her lips. Saying 'something you find pretty' or something like that would infer she wanted to look her prettiest for Ellesandra specifically. Which she did. But that might make them back out. "Something that is uniquely your own work. And if you want me to style your hair somehow in turn, I can."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra knew there was no rush, but it wa san excuse to pull away that she could latch onto. At the suggestion of doing something unique to Star's hair, she considered this. She focused on Star's hair for a moment, tilting her head and looking around to get an idea of Star's head shape. "I'll consider my options. And no, thank you." Yes, yes yes yes yes yes were the words that were being said in her heart. She loved Star playing with her hair, and braiding it would be very much the same. But despite wanting it - and knowing that Star could tell she was lying when she said no - she still said no. "I only braid it if I know I'm going into a messy long battle, since it can get in the way of fighting even if in it's ponytail." As if that was an excuse. It wasn't, considering they did know they'd be having to fight in the next few weeks, but Ellesandra was good at ignoring facts that pointed out flaws in her defensive logic. She moved over to her bag to gather some clothes and then straightened. Another glance was given around the room, just a cursory surveillance to ensure that nothing had somehow passed her notice before that might be of danger to Star, before she nodded to her. "I'll make the shower quick. Try to stay in the room, I don't like that the shower isn't directly connected in case something happens but we know there's danger in Gurhal, so caution is best." In fact, if it weren't for the fact she had a snotty nose and still felt the need to get away from Star to create some physical distance from her emotions and the object of them, then she probably would wait for Amara and Amelia to return anyways.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had an expression with a raised brow, and general air that communicated wordlessly how full of shit she knew Ellesandra was in the moment. But, she said nothing. "As you wish," was all she had to say, clear disappointment and mild annoyance carried on her tone. She adjusted herself in the bed as Ellesandra left it. She just ignored whatever lame excuse Ellesandra gave, waving it off with a very clear signal that she didn't care what their reason was, since she knew it was a load of crap anyway. Star obviously didn't like being lied to. Fair to say most people didn't. But she also knew this wasn't Ellesandra lying to her because she had ill intentions towards her. Just Ellesandra refusing anything and everything that could dare make them a little happy. "You really can just take your time you know. The shower might not be connected but it's just down the hall. I'll be here, and I can signal you through your aura if something bad happens. Like if I were to suddenly be assaulted by water that was either too hot or too cold or something, you know." A pointed look was given. Star wasn't in a bad mood. She was smiling. But she was steadily growing less and less tolerant of Ellesandra being so cruel to themselves as she felt them become closer.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the disappointment and annoyance. Not only through tone, but just the knowledge of how Star was feeling in general at all times now. They weren't touching, but they didn't need to be for Ellesandra to be in tune to Star's emotions, even without the help of auramancy. Her lips pursed and she watched Star for a moment, unsure what to say to make it better. The confirmation that Star could alert her via aura was good to know, but the comment about the too hot or too cold had Ellesandra blushing and looking away. "i...wasn't intending to do that." And this time, it was the truth. She truly just wanted to shower and clean up a little bit. Oh she also wanted to do this to create distance and deny herself what she wanted, but the shower wasn't being used as a punishment for herself this time. Refusing her desires for Star was her punishment. "I'll still be quick." That was the paranoia talking, even if she knew that Star could alert her. That was still a few doors down and Ellesandra couldn't just teleport into the room or anything. She opened the door and took a moment to look around the hallway outside before closing it behind her and heading down to where the bathroom door was. She went in - and just as she'd told Star, this was a normal shower. Maybe it was a little bit on the colder side - Ellesandra did still have some remnants of desire to cool off - but it was nowhere near the ice shower that she'd originally intended to take, and certainly well within levels of normal shower behavior for the average person who needed to not be aroused by their travelling companion. It was also quick, taking some time to scrub her face and do her hair being the longest bit of it. In only minutes, assuming nothing had happened between which would have interrupted the shower, she was heading back into the bedroom with a towel wrapped around her hair to help dry it and dressed in a clean outfit of clothes.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile at Ellesandra when they confirmed they weren't going to do it. She'd prefer they say 'I'm done doing that' and promise her it would stop, but...She'd take that much for now. A small nod followed, and when the knight departed, Star had a small flicker of guilt in her. Had that been too far? She was of two minds. She always wanted to be gentle and kind, but there was also something to be said about how Ellesandra might take that tenderness as a signal that her convictions weren't as strong on the matter. She hated, HATED the notion that Ellesandra intentionally subjected themselves to pain, on any level. It made her briefly see red just thinking about it. But while Ellesandra showered, she took some time to just...Breathe, and focus inwards. Temper her patience, and remind herself that this was a marathon, not a sprint. People didn't nix their bad habits overnight. So when Ellesandra came back in, Star was still just laying in the same posture, laying the proper lengthwise way along the bed, thoughtfully looking at the ceiling above. She gave a smile to the knight when they walked in, but didn't speak. There was still that lingering guilt the knight could feel, just barely. The more distance between them, the stronger the feeling had to be to bridge the gap, and this guilt wasn't too strong so it wouldn't be felt until Ellesandra was close to Star on the bed again. If they kept away and...sat on the floor or at the desk, then it would go without notice.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra came back in and moved straight to her bag first, packing up all the clothing and such, and moving the card from the pocket of her previous clothes to the pocket of her current one. She didn't look at it, not sure she wanted to see how the card might have changed in this timeframe, and not knowing exactly what to expect when one side or the other fully won out anyways. So she'd kept it face down as she moved it, simply tucking it away and then taking the bag of coin that had been the shared fund between them. Taking a few coins out that would surely pay for food, she tossed the bag over to Star. "You can add that back to the main coin fund. As unlikely as I think it'll be for us to be pickpocketed here, it's still safer in your magical storage space than it is on my person." She hadn't gotten close enough to Star to feel the guilt, at least not at first. But then she'd moved to place her armor and everything on the side of the bed, up close to Star, and that was when she felt the small tinge of guilt. Ellesandra paused, glancing over, but then didn't comment on it. It wasn't her emotion to bring up, even though she didn't think Star had anything to be guilty about. Ellesandra was the guilty party here, the one who had done things wrong in her past, the one who was guilty of fooling Star into falling for someone that Ellesandra wasn't, truly. If Star wanted to talk about whatever it was, she'd bring it up. "Bathroom is all yours. I'll follow you out to ensure no one else snuck in to ambush you, then head down for food. I'm not sure what all they have here, but is there anything in particular you would like? Any specialties or local foods to Gurhal only that you've missed?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star fumbled as the coin bag was tossed to her, trying to catch it in mid-air only to bounce it around a few times before her jumbled attempts to catch it resulted it in landing on her forehead. It wasn't heavy of course, she wasn't going to be hurt by it. Mild discomfort at best. But it was perhaps the first time that it became clear that Star had...Less than stellar dexterity. She was able to do precise motions when able to take her time, but in the matters of how she might be able to handle quick reactions in combat that would require bladework, she would be hopeless. She was practiced with magic, not martial things. Best to not toss something at her if it was particularly important. With a little blush, she took the bag off her face, and away it went to the magical storage space as she rubbed the spot it plonked down on her. She then wordlessly got out of bed as she considered what food there might be. Once standing, she tapped at her lips twice with one finger. "I'm not entirely familiar with what they'd have accessible in the sun plane, but I saw they have a koltava ranch here. So they should have koltova milk, which is pretty tasty. Tastes better than cow milk anyway, so long as you don't think about the beast it comes from. They probably won't have twilberry. And I've always wanted to try a dura gohra steak, but I'd doubt they'd have that here either, as that would be too dangerous a creature for them to hunt here. Uhh. Probably best you just ask what the chef recommendations are."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra noted the different things that Star mentioned. She'd make sure to ask about them, or keep them in mind at the very least for future places that might serve food. Some of them sounded more expensive, like potentially this dura gohra steak if the creature was dangerous, but a single night of splurging on a nice meal wouldn't harm them overall as long as that wasn't an every night thing. "Sounds good." She said, staring at Star's finger tapping her lips for just a little longer than any friend normally would. The thought of touching her lips with her own crossed her mind, but she pushed it to the side and tore her eyes away, opening the door. "Alright then." The words came out raspy again, that cold shower obviously not having helped much with preventing the attraction and those thoughts from being there. Even worse was the knowledge that Star could tell she had been aroused, which really did not help with the whole hiding her attraction and pretending it didn't exist thing. With a deep breath she would lead Star down to the bathroom, taking a quick moment to peek inside and ensure no one else had come in to hide and ambush Star while she was doing so, and then checking the hallway for anyone watching them oddly or anything like that, before finally letting Star into it and stepping away.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The arousal, the desire, was something that went both ways. Even just the simple reality of Star walking up close behind Ellesandra for them to exit the room, that proximity had them standing close enough together to make it clear that Star was hot under her collar just the same. She kept a calm face of course. But there was that subtle...throb of arousal just below the surface. The sort of emotion that made it all too easy to think about Ellesandra climbing on top of her, to think about hands roaming one another, to just tug Ellesandra along with her to the shower so they could let it all out instead of just spraying themselves with cold water and saying 'down girl' to themselves. That they had separate objectives was helpful in separating them, but it certainly did not bode well for future restraint if any time they were safe and alone somewhere, these desires were going to flare up. Much as Star was still inexperienced and shy on intimate matters, she couldn't really hide from Ellesandra anymore even if she wanted to - which she didn't - that very adult desires were burning between her legs. It came and went as Star moved to the shower, giving one last smile to Ellesandra before closing the door behind her. There would be no strange looks given by the fox-eared patrons. Just a calm, lazy day among trusting, gentle folk in a peaceful village. Ricca was sure to give Ellesandra a list of what she could make, since she was also the chef. Sort of a one-woman show in this tavern, it seemed. Koltova milk was certainly a feature, as was koltova steak. There were baked goods across the street for dessert, so Ricca never really saw purpose in making them, but did offer to run over and grab something there if there was interest. Ultimately, the things Star mentioned were all apparently more moon plane cuisine, except the dura gohra steak, which was a sun plane delicacy for its richness, but Ricca seemed even more desperate to try it than Star did. Which naturally meant that was also a no. Other than that, the expected ways to enjoy potatoes and various vegetables were present.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra pretended she didn't notice the desire blazing in Star too. Pretended when she did notice it, that it was just lust. Just a desire to be fucked, or to fuck Ellesandra - she wasn't sure if Star had a preference for one or the other or both. Pretending it was that did nothing to help prevent her own desire, but it did a lot to help prevent the guilt and self-doubt issues that would come if she was focusing on how much Star had romantic feelings for her. With the shower being secure, she headed down into the main room to talk to Ricca, after which she would order whatever the specialty or main meal was for both of them, along with two sides of this Koltova milk. She refused Ricca running over to get any desserts, but while Ricca was cooking or going about her business Ellesandra did take a jaunt over to the bakery herself. There was a moment that she just took in the smell, positive memories being associated with the smell of a bakery, but then she'd order something blueberry or fruity. Be that a scone, a pie, a type of bread, cookies - whatever looked tasty and was readily available. If blueberry wasn't available she'd go for other fruits. So by the time Star was out of her shower, Ellesandra would have a mini feast ready for her in their bedroom - depending on how long it took Ricca to prepare food and how long it took Star to shower the arousal off of herself.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's cold shower was...Fairly ineffective, but not overly long. Ellesandra would find Star in the room, having been there for a little bit waiting, when they walked in. The bakery had an older fox-woman running the place, and the four children who had been seen at the church a while back were seated at one of two tables in the place. They obviously recognized Ellesandra, but there was caution in the small kits, so they didn't speak to the knight, despite the clear curiosity. Ricca had prepared some koltova steak with mixed veggies and mashed potatoes. A simple, balanced meal. The koltova steak was beautifully marbled and had more of a fattiness to it than most cuts of cow steak. Different, but tasty. Ricca also was no gourmet chef, but the meals were made with competence and love. In some ways, it certainly outshined any of the routine and efficient meals of Myst. The meat cooked in butter and seasoned with seasonings that were native to the sun plane, it would be a flavour profile with which Ellesandra would be entirely unfamiliar, but it had a warmth and earthiness to it that made it robustly satisfying. The sort of meal that would appeal quite well to meat-lovers, which...Given the population of this town, should be little surprise. The rest of the food was decidedly average. And of course, the moment Star saw Ellesandra walking in with a blueberry pie, there was a mix of hungry excitement, and being touched at the woman's thoughtfulness yet again, which just...Flared right back into her romantic attraction and desires to do all kinds of intimate things with Ellesandra. So it might, or might not, prove to be a tense meal as both of them tried very hard to ignore how Star wanted to use her lips for something entirely different.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had smiled at the kids to try to ease some of their nerves. Just a friendly smile, but not approaching them or anything like that. When she came back in with the blueberry pie and the two plates of food, she was a little surprised to see Star there already. "Oh - that was quick." She commented, though the excitement she'd felt from Star was nice. And then she walked closer, finding a place to set the food and stuff down, and she felt how Star's desire had just...flamed up higher. This damn aura and resonance and literally feeling how much Star wanted her was doing things to her own desire, and she grumbled under her breath about it for a moment before setting about giving the food to Star. She had decided to sit in one of the chairs that Amelia and Amara had been sitting in before, simply because it was easier to eat that way than on the bed without getting crumbs or food everywhere. "So." She said, trying her damndest to ignore the rising sexual tension in the room. Again. "Ricca mentioned she was also super interested in that steak you mentioned. Perhaps in one of the next towns we'll be able to find it somewhere? Or even if we encounter the beast itself, I'm sure between the four of us we can figure out a way to get some meat from it and cook it tolerably." Definitely a forced topic. A forced conversation piece that could try to distract Ellesandra from the desire she felt burning in Star - and her own desire that was responding in kind.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star took Ellesandra's lead and took one of the other nearby chairs, and definitely wasn't doing this to stay close to Ellesandra or anything. Which is to say, of course, that is exactly what she wanted. Not getting food on the bed was also important, but to some degree...Star liked this torture. It would be better if they could actually act on it of course. But she'd never felt feelings like this before. Desire, arousal, sure. Physical lust was familiar. But this spark of emotion, this flame in them both, it drew her towards it like she was but a helpless moth. She wanted it. Needed it. She couldn't do anything about it, of course. But quite opposite to Ellesandra wanting to push down their emotions, Star wanted to live them. To let them flow through her and let her have the experience of just...Feeling them. Of course, the side effect remained that part of feeling it was also wanting to sit on Ellesandra's face, but she'd gone this long without giving in, she wasn't about to just snap unprompted. She smiled at her company at the subject. "It prefers arid lands. Deserts and dry canyons and valleys. The sun plane does have lots of those, but not in this immediate region. I've never seen one, but I hear they have tough hides. More than just make them harder to put down, I can't imagine getting a clean cut of meat from one will be easily done. But...Maybe we could figure it out, sure." Forced conversation as could be, but Star was still pleased to be chatting.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to what Star said, trying to focus on the topic at hand rather than the tension that was there. That, unlike the hide of this beast, felt like it could easily be cut it was so thick in the air. She chewed a piece of her steak thoughtfully, imagining this beast with tough hide, and shook her head. "I'm sure I'd be able to handle it. I can empower a blade with my magic to cut through harder things than hide. I was once tested to stab through a solid stone brick with it, just to see if I could and if it could be used to kill someone on the other side. I can, though if they are wearing armor on the other side of the stone it might not go all the way through it. Most of the magic had gotten used up in the strike on the stone, and it also depends on the length of the blade I'm using." Mission distract herself was failing though, as she watched Star bring a piece of food up to her lips, ad watched them close around the utensil. She clenched her jaw and forced her eyes away, but even without the auramancy her staring had been obvious. Her heart pounded heavily in her chest, and butterflies were setting up camp in her stomach. Like this was a date, or something. It totally wasn't a date. Not at all. "Any other foods or drinks that remind you of home?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The juicy piece of steak that Ellesandra watched moved up on the end of the fork to her lips. Those sweet, supple lips parted just slightly, and her tongue extended out to touch the meat as the fork guided it between her lips to close around and slowly pull out. Was Star intentionally making it sensual? No. But Ellesandra watching it with such burning arousal certainly made all those focal points more prominent. Her lips were delicate, but had a sweet feminine charm to them. A gently pronounced cupid's bow paired with the natural prominence of her lips made it all too easy to focus on them and...Fantasize about. Star had seen them staring at her, but...She wasn't going to acknowledge it. Mostly because, well, she liked it. Being stared at, wanted by Ellesandra...It wasn't helping. But her resistance held, though at this point she just...Idly crossed her legs. No reason for it. "I've seen you use that magic, sure. Though, are rapiers supposed to be used much for cutting? I don't really know much about weapons..." A thought that came and went fairly swiftly. "Uhm, well, there's mostly just stuff my mom made me rather than specific things from home. A lot of what I enjoy is fruits and veggies, and there's a large amount of commonality between the planes on that front. Obviously there's unique stuff all over the place, and subtle variations to things, so...Well, you got a blueberry pie, you'll see, I think, that that's probably what I've been looking forward to the most. The blueberries here are just...Better. And there are ducks here, too, so...I'm sure we could find you someone in a bigger settlement that could make something similar to that honey-glazed duck you told me about."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Damn. Star was torturing her, even if it was unintentional or unknowing. She cleared her throat, looking down at her plate with a determination to not look up from it again. Not see how good looking Star was and how kissable those lips were. How she'd like to taste the blueberry pie off of Star's ton- Stop it! "You're right, rapiers aren't good for cutting, but I can use that magic on any weapon I have. It's obviously not great for blunt weapons, but piercing or cutting isn't really their purpose to begin with." And then, at the idea of different things tasting better - or at least different here - Ellesandra tried to focus on how this steak was different from a cow's steak. NOT on wondering how someone born here might taste different to be eaten out. That is certainly not where her mind had gone to, wondering about Star. She was blushing at this point, these thoughts going through her head. It was odd, being a blusher in this situation. Typically if she wanted someone, she went for it. But there were many reasons why going for this wasn't a good idea, which meant she just had to...sit with that desire and not do anything about it. This was not what she usually did, and thus the blushing and being unsure how to handle herself. She tried to focus on honey glazed ducks, food she liked. "I'll keep an eye out for them. It's entirely possible that it won't live up to that in my memory from nostalgia alone, but no reason not to try right?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The unfortunate reality was that this was a fight these two weren't likely to win. Star was aroused. Ellesandra was aroused. Each of them being aroused could be felt by the other. Each one feeling the other's arousal made the other person's arousal worse. Their emotions fed into each other. Which was something that happened with most emotions, really. Happiness made for more happy. Sad made for matched sad, even if it was only sympathetic. To various degrees, people generally matched the emotions of people around them unless there was something stopping it. Star remembered that Ellesandra had a dagger, and that made much more sense, evoking a nod. And for some reason, a flash of Ellesandra having her hands bound in a cute ribbon above her head while on top of her flashed into her mind. Her face went bright red, and a flash of arousal rose in her for the knight to feel. Where did THAT come from? Star gave a shaky exhale, reaffirming her control over herself. More sitting there, not doing anything about all of this. "And of course. I mean, I'm sure you'll find lots of things to like, familiar and not. I'd like it if we could find more things like that. You're obviously locked onto my favourite food," she said, pointing her fork at the blueberry pie. "...So it's only natural I'd want you to have nice things, too. And if you try to say it's not important or it doesn't matter, I will do have to do something drastic," she said, playfully of course. Some secret weapon, perhaps, that she had devised.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the flash of arousal and had to wonder what it was she'd said that had caused that. Or what it was that Star had thought. Or was the food an aphrodisiac of sorts? that might be, considering how strong her arousal was right now - even if the arousal, in reality, had nothing to do with the food. She took a deep breath, closing her eyes and placing a bite of vegetables into her mouth to focus chewing on, focusing on anything but her desire to throw the food to the side and grab Star. "Something drastic?" She asked, both curious and concerned at what Star might have been planning if she said it wasn't important that she had nice things. Which was 100% something she would say, she knew it. She opened her eyes and looked back up at Star, raising an eyebrow. If Star wanted to play drastic, Ellesandra would play drastic. And make it a game of seeing how much she could make Star blush. "The nicest thing that I currently desire is sitting right in front of me." Ellesandra had a cocky smirk spreading on her face now. Okay, so she wasn't going to be able to ignore the tension. Instead, she was going to pretend it was lust only, and play into it. See how far she could push until Star decided to shut her own arousal down.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star nodded softly at Ellesandra's words, wearing a smile that was playfully warning them. Something super ultra omega drastic. Her ultimate weapon, perhaps. Something that would destroy Ellesandra, send them to their knees and beg for mercy. Or so went Star's internal monologue. Something that was thrown for a loop when Ellesandra shot out a dangerous line about wanting her. Star initially went wide in the eyes and bright red in the cheeks, but...She also could tell that Ellesandra didn't have the necessary conviction behind those words. She'd been around plenty of teasing, and being able to see the intent behind words meant that...Unless Ellesandra was going to actually act on those emotions, Star could tell it was a bluff. Didn't mean that it didn't make her heart jump out of her chest, because she really wanted them to act on it. But if they were going to play into it, Star wasn't going to take it lying down (or would she?). So what came firing back at Ellesandra might be unexpected. Sure, she was blushing, and looking away from the knight. But Star just went right back to her most trusted method: Complete, open honesty. "So take it."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

At first, Ellesandra had enjoyed the blush and Star looking away. She'd smiled wider, prepared to tease more, to add more to the threat, but then...Star just caused her plan to backfire to hell and back. Her mouth dropped open in a bit of surprise, staring at her. Her mind sped up, heart beating against her chest as if it were a caged animal, her whole body responding to the idea of taking Star right here, right now. Her body wanted it, and Star would be able to tell. The arousal had spiked hard and there was a predatory desire to do exactly what Star had just offered. To pull her out of her chair and press her to a wall. Not to make love to Star, but to fuck her silly, to teach her what pleasure meant. But Ellesandra took a breath, doing everything she could to reign in that desire. Star didn't deserve that, not as her first time. Star deserved the loving, gentle lovemaking that came with the emotional and romantic intimacy she was looking for. Ellesandra didn't know how to offer that, how to do that. That realization hit like a ton of bricks, bringing her arousal back down. Not all the way gone - oh there was still definitely that tension there - but enough that Ellesandra's conscious mind could take over again. She closed her mouth and looked down at Star's plate. Without a word, she took her fork and speared the remaining bit of Steak on Star's plate, picking it up and pulling it over to her own. As if that had been what she'd meant by what she desired. Not Star, but the food on her plate. Oh it was a lie that even Ellesandra herself didn't believe, let alone Star being able to see through it, but it was a response that wasn't her blubbering out of it, or taking Star up on the offer. A middle ground.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the immediate 'oops' of being so bold. The feelings she was seeing in Ellesandra weren't what she wanted, of course; she did want intimacy, tenderness, lovemaking. She didn't want to just mash bits together until they made weird noises and made a mess of the bed. It had to be meaningful. It was what she knew was holding them both back from actually making good on any of these threats. Even if Ellesandra did try to roughly start tearing into her, she would have pushed them away. And that would just do way more damage than good for their relationship. So with a deep breath, Star reigned herself in again, entirely unsure how to speak or address the tension now. Her plate was empty with that last bit of meat gone, but she didn't even seem to notice. She'd been hungry. But hunger was the last thing on her mind now. She was gonna...Have some weird dreams tonight. And for the time being, she was just silent, trying to work through her emotions, and try very hard to not give into the desire to bare herself for Ellesandra and just let them do whatever they wanted to her, if only for some semblance of relief from this ache between her legs. Even through all this...It was still that novel emotion, and still something she wanted to experience. Still something she enjoyed, on some level, no matter how torturous it was to her in the moment. Ultimately, she did speak up, though her choice of subject was...Questionable. "Uhm, Ellesandra? Do you mind if I ask a uh...Weird...Maybe difficult question?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't even want Star's steak, but she played at eating it because - well - it was better than not. Her eyes were solely locked on her plate, having not touched the blueberry pie at all since she'd essentially bought that for Star. She was lost in the mental kicking of herself for having started the flirting just now when Star's question broke her from her thoughts. She glanced up briefly, only to look back down at her plate and clear her throat. "That hasn't really stopped you before, Star." This wasn't criticism, or intended hurtfully. It was an observation that Star had been fully comfortable asking her weird, personal and emotional questions in the past. Encouraged Ellesandra to share the deepest parts of her emotions and trauma. What was it now that she considered so weird and difficult that she felt the need to get permission to do so? "Go ahead." She finally added, hoping that whatever question this was would help to take her mind off of the current tension, either way. She didn't have much more to eat herself, but with having added the rest of Star's steak to her plate, she began working at it again.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star rubbed at the back of her head, blushing more furiously, with the accompanying rise in discomfort and arousal coming up in her heart that might give Ellesandra a hint at what she was going to ask about. "What's it like?" she asked. Which might initially come with a tiny bout of confusion, because...What was 'it'? But then given the nature of what was going on, 'it' might have a clearer definition. Star gulped, clarifying further. "You know...Sex. I...I know there's no substitute for experience on it but, uhm...I just...I don't want to be...Bad at it." Part of her wanted to clarify she wasn't thinking about Ellesandra specifically with this but, well...She was. So. That'd be a lie. There wasn't anyone else she wanted to have sex with. So maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't. But if they were going to, she didn't want to make a fool of herself.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had been confused at first, like Star thought she would be. What was what like? Being as traumatized as she had been? Going through life being unlovable? Knowing that you were the cause of death for someone you'd loved? Those were the things that came to her mind at the question, though immediately dismissed when Star clarified that she meant sex. A mixtures of amusement and....it wasn't pity, or a negative emotion really, but more just a...regret that Star was in a situation where she hadn't found someone she'd wanted to have that with before. And now that she did, Ellesandra wasn't the right person for it. Wasn't able to really give her what she wanted. She didn't answer right away, chewing slowly while collecting her thoughts and trying to determine how to answer. She finally leaned back in her chair and looked over to Star, a more serious look on her face. "It's hard to give you a solid answer to that, Star, because it's different for everyone. Everyone likes different things. Sex with one person might feel different and include entirely different acts than sex with another. It's about exploration and finding what you both like, coming together to find a middle ground where you both enjoy things, or are willing to take turns doing what the other person enjoys." She paused, considering more and reaching up to scratch at the back of her head. Not nervous, but more...focused and thoughtful. Oddly, the question was a successful way to get her mind off of the desire to pin Star down and show her. "For me, the best part is giving pleasure, for example. For another, it might be receiving. Not that I dislike receiving, but when I feel a partner come undone beneath me it fills me with more satisfaction than anything else I've experienced, ever. That doesn't necessarily mean I have to be in charge, though. I can take orders well, as long as those orders are allowing me to please my partner." She shrugged. "When it comes to receiving pleasure...I'm not sure how to describe it. It builds up, usually anyways, and you can just feel the pleasure getting more and more intense. An orgasm sends you over and if it's a particularly good one you might see stars, but those are rare and usually require either a talented partner or one you're very interested in and aroused by." She paused, not sure if that explanation had gone further than Star meant, and looked to check in to see if the woman had become a red tomato ready to pop. "I'm not sure what exactly you're wanting out of that question. If that doesn't answer it, could you narrow it down?"


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star definitely had turned into a bright red tomato. Ellesandra would be able to feel it the whole time. The longer they went on, the more Star's embarrassment and arousal rose. She asked the question, but boy was she ill-prepared for the answer. She didn't have any regrets, that much was clear through the emotional connection. It was that feeling that one felt when they did something they knew they wanted to do, but weren't quite ready for how intense it might be. While it was helpful for Ellesandra to quiet their arousal, it did the opposite for Star. Her folded legs were squeezed together tightly. And for someone as experienced as Ellesandra? Well. The auramancy wasn't needed to see how pent up Star was, and how she was undoubtedly a mess now, both literally and figuratively. But whatever it was Star wanted to know, it seemed like she got it, because she was gently shaking her head. "N-No no, no, uhm. That's good. Answered the question, yep." Then, heavy breath out, because gods above she was horny.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra started at Star when she stuttered out an answer. Her eyes dropped to her legs, the red on her face, and how she was obviously uncomfortable. It wasn't that she was uncomfortable and hated the topic though. No. Ellesandra was willing to bet that all it would take was her slipping her hand into Star's pants and lightly teasing her to push her over the edge with the level of arousal she felt from Star right now. The temptation to do that was so, so strong. She clenched her hand into a fist to resist reaching out, licking her lips and closing her eyes. "Well." She said, her voice back into that rough, husky tone. "I think I'm going to go check the place out. Outside. walk around a little and ensure we weren't followed. I'll leave you to, um. Stay in here, alone. And take care of things. For - thirty minutes?" Ellesandra wanted to take care of Star so, so much. But she still wasn't ready for the type of intimacy Star wanted, needed. She wasn't ready to be emotionally vulnerable and available for Star. And with the lack of that, well. Star was a big girl, she surely knew how to masturbate right? Ellesandra refused to believe Star had gone this long in life without taking care of herself here and there. So, she reached for Star's plate and began to collect dishes, taking a long swig of the milk to finish it off so it wasn't being wasted. "Sound like a plan?" She asked to confirm, only because she didn't want Star to feel awkward or as if she had to do that, if she actually wasn't interested in it.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star looked at Ellesandra with a bit of confusion. She tilted her head. Ellesandra didn't usually separate from her. The confusion was in more than just looks. It was felt. "Uh," she began, not sure what to make of all this. "Seems a little unnecessary but...So does a lot of the stuff you do, but I've gotten used to that. So, if you wanna make sure there is nobody waiting around outside, I guess, uh, go ahead?" she said, still confused as she handed the plate over to Ellesandra to bring back. There was no way...Right? Surely she was just being coy...


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

No fucking way. Ellesandra stared at Star in disbelief when she was confused at what Ellesandra was offering her, suggesting. She cleared her throat. "Star. To be clear, I'm offering an excuse for you to masturbate and work off some of that arousal." She was blunt and to the point, like she normally was. She'd been trying to just imply it so that she didn't over-embarrass Star, but with Star having not seemed to get it, Ellesandra felt the need to be more direct. "For me just as much as for you. It is killing me to sit here feeling you as aroused as you are and not doing anything, but we both know that what I want to do and what you want me to do are not the same thing." Ellesandra was meaning the difference between fucking and love making, but the truth was Ellesandra did want the latter. She just wasn't ready or willing to admit she did, and that she deserved that. That she was worthy of having that with Star. So, to her, fucking was what it would be. Because it was all someone as broken as her could handle. She didn't say any of this, feeling it was pretty clear by the difference of what they both wanted right now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star blinked. "Oh. I don't want to do that, though. I never have," she said, meeting Ellesandra's to-the-point explanation with some of her own. Sure, this was about as aroused as she'd ever been, so it would provide the relief she wanted. But somehow, she still didn't seem to actually want to do that, like just about anyone in her position would want to do. Would be thankful for the chance to do. "I-I uhm, that is...If you want some privacy for that, I can busy myself for uh...Thirty minutes, you said?" she said, looking off to the side, still red as could be.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra blinked. Then blinked again. "You've never..." She cut herself off, not wanting to sound judgmental. She wasn't being judgmental at all, more just completely shocked. Star had both never been with anyone before, and never taken care of herself before. And she didn't want to? Was that just because she didn't know what she was missing, or was there something else with auramancy involved there? A thing where she couldn't actually get off without being connected to someone or something? She blinked a few more times, speechless, before shaking her head and breaking herself out of it. "No, I'm fine." She said, finishing collecting all of the plates, and mumbling beneath her breath. "You'd probably be able to feel me doing it anyways." How exactly did aura's work when it came to that? That would be a question for later, or - well, maybe never. If they ever were intimate, a question for after that. She straightened and moved to the door. "I'll be right back. If you change your mind, I - well, I'm sure I'll be able to tell too." And she left the red-faced Star behind, trying to give her space to recover from the blushing, and give herself some space to clear her head. And not want so badly to show Star what she was missing. Her stomach roiled, not from the food but that she wasn't acting on her desire, her need. But her heart...it ached. Because it needed Star too, and it was being denied her. Denied by herself, but for reasons she thought were good.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could bear the aches of a thousand lifetimes of desire and arousal. But feeling the ache in Ellesandra's heart for being denied what was needed, that affected her. Ellesandra wouldn't notice, because Star kept the same expression and the distance between them grew large enough before Ellesandra would feel the resulting echo of pain and desire to connect with the knight. Everything being able to be returned, Ellesandra would find if they went back to the room that Star had moved back to the bed, under the covers. Her hands were on top of the covers, lest there be any concern that she was just lying the whole time and secretly was doing what she said she'd never done under the blanket. And the moment she saw Ellesandra, she raised the blanket to invite them in with a smile. The arousal hadn't gone anywhere but...There was something more important. She wanted to invite Ellesandra back in for more cuddling. Of course...That closeness had a new danger associated with it given their current emotional states but...They'd managed to keep that under wraps so far, right?


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had headed back to the room after only a quick glance around to check to see if Amelia or Amara were back. She didn't know how long it was supposed to take them, and it wasn't the type of situation to need a sending coin for, but if they were back safely that would be a bit of relief. She hadn't realized that she was worried for them and making sure nothing happened to them, either, until they'd left and she was now realizing they hadn't returned yet. When she entered the room again, she came up short when she saw Star under the covers. She didn't even see the hands on top of the covers, only seeing where Star was and immediately turning her eyes. "Oh I'm sor-" She was about to apologize for interrupting when the movement of Star's hands raising the covers to invite her in grabbed her attention from the corner of her eye. She paused, unsure what that was. Was that a sexual invitation, or something else? She glanced over, seeing that Star had clothes on and it was more just her inviting Ellesandra under the covers. Right now, she wasn't sure that was a good idea, no matter how much her heart skipped a beat and wanted her to do it. She glanced around. If there had been another bed in the room, she would have taken it instead, to try to keep distance. In this situation, there wasn't. The need to accept Star's comfort warred with the need to keep distance between them, an obvious look of indecision on her face, before she finally relented. She took in a deep breath to steel herself before she made herself ready for bed - namely removing shoes - and then slid into the covers as offered. She kept some distance from Star, at least as much as you could in a single bed and with an auramancer who was particularly cuddly. She wouldn't move away from Star if Star cuddled into her, but she was...awkward. Stiff. Unsure how to handle this now that the arousal and desire had been so obvious between them.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star saw the indecision, and some amount of uncertainty flared in her heart. Had it been wrong to offer? Their eventual acceptance was pleasing, but she didn't want to make Ellesandra feel uncomfortable. But the whole point of this was to make things more comfortable. To soothe Ellesandra's worried heart. So she stuck to her guns, lowering the blanket over Ellesandra when they joined her in bed, and cuddled up to them. No, distance wasn't an option. Star was far, faaaaaar too cuddly. There wasn't a reality where they slept back to back with as much distance as possible from one another. She slid against Ellesandra, her head tucking under theirs, or theirs tucking under hers, whichever felt right in the moment, then arms and legs tangled up and the intimate cuddling could continue, but with both women being fed and clean to there'd be no reason to break away from it this time. And, well, of course...Legs being tangled had the risk of some serious heat being felt on Ellesandra's thigh. But as long as they could ignore that - and the still very potent arousal felt from Star - then everything was fine, right? Star was managing just fine, after all. Her wants and desires were clear, but she wasn't acting on them. She focused instead on Ellesandra's desire to be close, to be intimately cuddled, to be comforted, to feel connected with someone else and to feel tenderness and affection showered upon them. Star was happy to do all that, and put all that physical stuff by the wayside. It would pass. Probably.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let Star cuddle up against her, placing her head underneath Ellesandra's. When she felt the obvious heat on her leg though, from Star tangling them together, her breath caught. She closed her eyes and focused very, very hard on NOT moving her leg. The last thing she wanted to do was unintentionally give Star her first orgasm from leg grinding when it wasn't what Star was going for. The woman had more willpower than most Ellesandra knew and it was taking every ounce of her own to not do things with the knowledge of how much Star wanted her. Feeling that arousal through the touch and aura. She swallowed heavily, trying to relax into the cuddling, to enjoy the sensation of Star pressed up against her. Part of her did - part of her never wanted Star to leave. To always be able to be held like this. Star was the only person to hold her lovingly like this since Marigold, and when Marigold did it it had been a very different type of affection. It had been sisterly, not romantically, and after a while Ellesandra avoided it because that hurt too much. Now? Now her heart was aching for more of this. But Ellesandra wasn't sure how much of it she could truly take. Instead, she mumbled. "Did you not want me to braid your hair anymore?" That had been on the docket after dinner, but when she'd come back in and Star invited her to cuddle instead, she hadn't been thinking to suggest that instead. Now, with them pressed together, feeling the arousal - Ellesandra was shifting her hips a little herself. Discomfort in how aroused she was without it being sated at all, but also an entirely unwillingness to pull away from Star. One hand wrapped under and around Star, lightly brushing her back. It was only a half-returned cuddle, but it was more than nothing.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star looked up at Ellesandra briefly. "In the morning. Get it nice and pretty before heading out for the day," she said, smiling, then moved back down to tuck her head under Ellesandra's and against their chest. She knew how hard it was for Ellesandra. It was hard for her, too. But she believed in their ability to resist giving into these things until it was right. She did as she usually did. Fingers stroked through Ellesandra's hair, while the other gently stroked along their back. She recalled the scars she had seen on Ellesandra's back, and that gave her a moment of consideration. On one hand, what she was thinking of doing was not at all sexual. On the other hand, it certainly might not help the situation. But...She had to at least ask: "Ellesandra do you...Mind if I touch your bare back? Just, my hand up the back of your shirt. Nothing untoward, I promise. I just...Want to do something."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded at the suggestion of doing it tomorrow. She took a deep breath, closing her eyes and trying not to focus on the arousal wvidenr between both of them. When she heard Stars question though, there was...confusion, and then immediately discomfort at the idea. The scars on her back - well, they didn't still hurt physically, but they very much did so emotionally. She shifted a little, then shook her head. "I...would rather you didn't." Her voice was apologetic, for denying Star something that should be simple and easy, but she knew Star would trace those scars. Who wouldn't, when given access to touch them? They would be a curiosity, something different, neat. Maybe pity inducing. But Ellesandra did not want yo remember the moments where she got those.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded against Ellesandra's chest. "I won't, then," she said softly. There was no offense, no pain at being told no. She obviously had something she wanted to do, but she wasn't going to pressure Ellesandra on the matter. She was trying to comfort them, not make them feel bad. "I...I want to heal you, Ellesandra. Your arm, mostly...But I remember seeing those scars on you, too. I don't know how you feel about them, so...I wouldn't just assume you'd want to be rid of them. But if that was something you wanted, I'd want to do that, too." Naturally, just expressing this want wasn't her saying she was going to do it, in a way it was asking permission indirectly. "You don't have to talk about things if it makes you uncomfortable of course but...I want to know everything about you, you know..?"


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let out a relieved breath when Star relented without any real argument. She'd expected this to be a big thing. But then Star said she wanted to heal them. And Ellesandra stiffened in her hold, shifting uncomfortably for a reason entirely different from the aroused awkwardness of before. Now, she was shifting so that Star couldn't easily touch her back, as if Star would be trying to heal her without consent or something. "No." The word came out firm and maybe a little harsh, harsher than she'd intended anyways, but she was being very clear in her lack of interest in that. Really, it was mostly the scars on her back. Her arm...well, she didn't necessarily WANT it healed, but she could probably be convinced there. But her back? She felt like she deserved those scars, and more. And though those weren't the ones that still hurt physically on occasion, like her shoulder did, those were the ones that hurt emotionally. That reminded her of what her actions had wrought. And the idea of talking about it? It caused her stomach to turn and she had to fight down a wave of sickness. "I don't think I can." It was the truth. She'd enjoyed the crutch of being able to just show Star the memories before, because it meant she didn't have to talk about them. But this one - unless there was a way that Star could view the memories as only a viewer, not through Ellesndra's experience, then she wouldn't.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star did still want to, of course. But Ellesandra said no. Or at least expressed discomfort. While it wouldn't always be possible, Star wanted to ease this beautiful woman she was falling in love with into these moments in a way that helped them feel comfortable. There came breaking points, and she had noticed for certain that Ellesandra was much more comfortable just not engaging in anything of or related to the depths of their emotions. Ignored for so long, these wounds had become so sensitive. It was fortunate, then, that Star's hand was peerlessly gentle. She felt the guilt. The shame. All the other emotions that rose up when the topic was on their scars. Then, the wave of sickness and deep emotional hurt at the subject of knowing everything about the other. She didn't respond with fear, or anger, or rejection when Ellesandra uttered the harsh 'no', nor did she recoil from the notion that Ellesandra was reacting with internal violence when thinking about the proposition. Instead, Star moved a hand to do something a little different. She had been continually stroking her hand through Ellesandra's hair at the back, but decided to bring that hand to be between the two of them so she could take some of Ellesandra's hair and let her fingers tangle in it smoothly, so as to not cause any knots, and do little motions like twirling some of the hair around her index finger before sliding that finger away to let the hair free again, done with a close proximity to Ellesandra's cheek so there would be the occasional brush of her fingers or tickle of hair against the soft flesh. She looked at the woman she held so intimately with deep, deep sympathies. "I believe in you, Ellesandra. You've already come so far. It might sound a little...I don't know...Cheesy...But I'm proud of you. A pride that...Comes from you continuing to validate my belief in you, I guess. I'm sure that if you went back in time and told yourself where you'd be right now, your past self would look at you like you grew two more heads and had a snake for a tongue or something," she said with a soft smile rising to her lips. Her eyes focused on Ellesandra's. This warmth. This intimacy. It did require a great deal of restraint of course but...Aside from having to resist the urge to strip nude and beg for Ellesandra to do naughty things to her, the moment was empowering for her. Her aura had become flush with strength. She felt fulfilled. Alive. And while it was but scratching the very smallest surface of the depths of this mystic power of hers, Ellesandra would feel the echoes of it, though perhaps it remained below their notice. A steady trickle of mana, of power, flowed between their connection to empower Ellesandra in turn just below the surface of consciousness. And this power came with a more prominent swell when Star boldly leaned in to press a soft kiss to Ellesandra's cheek. Last time she did that, Ellesandra ran away from her, so she was prepared for the worst...But she did very much hope they stayed cuddled so close to her, for it was bringing her so very much happiness.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra lay there, still as Star moved to take a strand of her hair near her face. She...didn't know how to respond to any of this. She was out of her element. The twirling of her hair, with Star's fingers brushing her cheek every now and again, made her want to lean her head into Star's hand. To press herself close and lose herself in the scent of Star, the comfort and warmth of her embrace. How she direly needed that physical comfort. The words, however, were the main thing that she was uneasy with. She honestly didn't remember the last time anyone other than Aeras had told her they were proud of her. Aeras had when she got officially assigned to Marigold as her personal bodyguard, having passed multiple royal guards who had been wanting the position. Overall, a handful of them were honestly better martial fighters than her too. But she had both her strength against magic going for her, as well as her relationship with Marigold. It was determined that it would be best if Ellesandra, who was already close and a good friend to Marigold, was chosen for her comfort. But Aeras had ignored that part of it. He'd told her he was proud of her for working so hard to get there. Which she had - she'd trained with Sia more than any other student at the time, but only Sia and Aeras had known that. And Sia certainly wasn't the type of woman to tell Ellesandra she was proud of her. In fact, Ellesandra was quite certain that Sia was ashamed to have called her a student, by the end of it. So Star saying it now...It was both welcome, and also made her extremely uncomfortable. And then Star kissed her cheek. Ellesandra's heart literally did somersaults in her chest. Her stomach tightened, and her whole body stiffened. She both loved the gentle kiss, wanted more of it, but also wanted none of it. The clashing of desires and needs and what she thought was best for them was becoming too much and Ellesandra closed her eyes. "Star." The word came out in a choked whisper, barely pushed through a tense throat. Anxiety; while Star surely would have sensed paranoia, caution, and guardedness about Ellesandra plenty, even panic once or twice, this would have been the first time she'd have felt anxiety. Ellesandra didn't follow it up with anything - she didn't know what to say. She did know that she didn't know how to handle this situation, or how her mind told her something very different from what her body wanted, or any of it. It was all a lot, and she was shutting down. The power that had flowed into her was completely unfelt in the midst of such an emotional storm.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Shhh.." came Star's tender coo. She lay her hand that was twirling their hair against their cheek, cupping it in reassurance. She let a moment of silence linger between them, just feeling their presence and their emotions and their anxieties and their wants and needs and fears. "It's okay, Ellesandra," she whispered, eyes briefly closed, then opened to look the other woman in the eyes with tenderness and affection. "I know it's hard," she continued, still whispering. "Just breathe...And relax. I know it sounds impossible right now, just...Breathe with me," she said, starting into a slow, guiding inhale that she was hoping Ellesandra would match, met with a slow exhale through the mouth. Regulated breathing wasn't going to just cure anxiety, of course, but it would help a little. That, combined with Star's soothing presence, how her comforts were always so much more potent, how she was able to be an emotional anchor for others by passing on the sensation of calm and allowing Ellesandra to feel that she, despite her arousal, despite her wants, her conflicting desires, felt inner peace and calm. How she was just living in the moment, not worried about what tomorrow would bring, not worried about what hardships lay ahead...She was just here, with Ellesandra, enjoying every moment. "Come here," she whispered, then moved to adjust their posture so she could bring Ellesandra's head under her chin and against her chest, a place they had found comfort in before. A place where they could feel her heavy, but steady heartbeats. She was still excited, of course. This moment they were sharing was tossing whole trees onto the building flame in her heart. But still...She embraced calm. Resisted the urge for action and just...Held the woman before her, now stroking their head tenderly. "I'll hold you until the storm passes. Always."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra tried to breath with her, but it was..hard. She felt her throat tighten with the anxiety. A panic attack? Not really - at least not yet. But the anxiety expressed itself physically in the tightening of her throat, making it harder to breathe in deeply. She didn't resist when Star pulled her in closer, head nuzzling against Star's chest and body pressing into hers. Normally she'd be feeling particularly aroused by this closeness, but right now she was entirely focused on how the closeness was making her want more. Want things that she couldn't, shouldn't have. Things she didn't deserve. Things that Star didn't deserve of her - that she'd be a bad partner, all of that again. The reinforcement that Star would always be there was enough to bring tears to her eyes. She didn't even know why the hell she was crying, but the reassurance, the emotional safety she felt in Star's arms made her feel like it was okay to just cry. She didn't sob, not like before. Hell, it was less crying and more just tears occasionally springing forth from the corners of her eyes. But she soaked up all of the warmth and comfort Star was giving her, letting herself focus instead on Star's steady heart beat. How it reassured her that Star was alive, there, and safe currently. How she hadn't failed in at least this mission yet, she hadn't failed Star yet. And while there was a certainty somewhere inside her that, eventually, she would fail Star because she, herself, was a failure and not worth being a guard or close person to Star, that wasn't top of mind right now. That was just a dwelling of feeling, self doubt and self hatred that was buried beneath the warmth, acceptance, and love Star was showing her. "I'm scared." She whispered. Something that no one had ever heard her admit before, not even Marigold. She was terrified of these feelings, of hurting Star, of failing her too. Oh she wasn't scared of the enemy, not in the way of someone scared of death. She was scared that she'd let the enemy get to Star, or Amelia, or Amara, or anyone else fighting with them. That they would die because she was unable to protect them. Again. That she would hurt Star because she wasn't good at this, or even knew how to do anything like this. That it would be Star's first time, her first love, and that she'd ruin Star's optimism regarding it. All of this fear showed itself, finally.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

When Star was younger, she got into a habit of telling people 'I know' when hearing them express their emotions. She meant this as a form of empathy, and it was still right to do at times. But sometimes, saying that was just...Obvious. Of course she knew. It was little more than a platitude, and didn't address the emotion itself, or in this case, how significant it was for Ellesandra to vocalize those fears. Feeling something and saying it were two different things, after all. Star gently squeezed Ellesandra against her chest in the wake of those words. "It's okay to be scared. I get scared a lot, too. But when I get scared, I remember that I have you. That gives me comfort, you know? It's not that I think nothing bad is going to happen...Really, it's inevitable that bad things are going to happen. Small things, big things...There are going to be a lot of scary times in our future. From things like how I feel I might upset you, might hurt your feelings or make you think less of me..." She paused for a moment, still gently stroking Ellesandra's hair. "...To someone taking you away from me." Star didn't need to say how that scared her, for there was a flare-up of that very real fear in her heart just saying it. The fear came...Then it passed, replaced by comfort and affection. Nobody had taken Ellesandra away. They were still here, in her arms. "If...You think it might help, you can tell me what makes you scared. If it's easier then...I think I might be able to give you a way to show me instead. I know it's hard to put things into words sometimes." Truly, Star did so much more through feeling, rather than saying, though some might still say she was well spoken all the same.

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the squeeze, leaning into Star with it. Her head nuzzled even tighter against Star's chest, ear pressed against her to better hear the heart beat within her chest. The idea that Star was so scared someone would take Ellesandra away from her both made her feel good, but also even more scared. Ellesandra's job was dangerous, and she wasn't exactly the most cautious person when it came to her own safety. It was even more likely she hurt Star by doing something reckless or stupid to get herself killed, simply because she didn't value her own life. What happened with Valentina that morning crossed her mind and the state Star had been in when Ellesandra stepped back through the portal. At the suggestion of talking to Star about what scared her, she shook her head vigorously. That was an immediate no. The idea of trying to verbalize these things, with the anxiety and how it tightened her throat, was not a good one. She'd struggle with talking about even non triggering things right now. Talking about this? No, she'd give herself an actual panic attack if she did. The idea of being able to show, though, spiked a bit of interest. She pulled her head back, eyebrows scrunching up and looking up to Stars face. A brief temptation to lean up and kiss her, but that was pushed down. Instead, she asked - "How? I don't...I don't want you to feel things that hurt you."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had to hold in a little giggle at how immediate that head shake was. It was cute. But the subject matter was still too dour to be giggling. It was still something to see the woman in this vulnerable state. Cute, yes. But touching, as well. They trusted her, felt safe enough around her, to be this way. It never ceased to make Star's heart flutter. At the other's query, she knit her brow a moment in thought. "Hmm.." she began, thoughtfully stroking Ellesandra's hair. "It's not like I am actually hurt by your memories, if that's what you mean. It might be harder for you since the whole auramancy stuff isn't something you were born with, but it should feel separate. Experiencing things like that is part of the process, because that's just what empathy is. To truly understand something, it has to be felt. It's not like things like memories and sympathetic healing are actually doing harm to my body. Plus...You know...I'm a big girl, Ellesandra. I've been wounded before, plenty. You won't see any scars on me from it but...I've been hit by arrows, stabbed, cut...Thankfully nothing quite as bad as some of the things my previous guardian endured; you and Amara have also endured worse just from what we've experienced together. But the point is that...I'm no stranger to pain, and sometimes you have to endure pain to accomplish the things you want to accomplish."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. "No, I - " It wasn't just the physical pain. Sure the whips had hurt and she didn't want to subject Star to that, but it wasn't that she was concerned about. It was the emotional trauma that happened. Just the memory of how she'd totally broken sent pain through her again. Star was so...so empathetic, how would she handle seeing and feeling that? Even if it was separate, she'd still feel it. "It's...not the physical. Though I don't want you to feel that either." Ellesandra ducked her head down, as if hiding it again, ashamed of how hurt she'd been by what happened. Ashamed for not being stronger than she was. "I also...don't want to re-experience it." Sharing that would force her to relive the memory. A memory, multiple memories really, that she'd pushed down so hard. Tried to do everything she could to forget. Even when she remembered, it was small chunks at a time - she didn't ever sit and just relive all of it that happened those days. She didn't let herself dwell on that; if she had, she wouldn't be here anymore. It was a survival mechanism, to not think about those things. To repress them as much as possible. She squeezed Star, pressing her face even harder into Star's chest, to the point it might be a little uncomfortable. "I'm afraid of living it again."


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star drew in a slow breath, nodding slowly to the words spoken. "I understand, Ellesandra. I know how scary it is," she said, with confidence that it was appropriate to say this given that she did literally know exactly how much the thought scared them, and because it qualified what she needed to say. "You know I'll never force you. But you also have to know how much it hurts me to know you're suffering, that something can grip you with so much fear. I don't want you to hurt. I don't want to put you through traumatic things. I want you to be happy...But you have to hear me when I tell you that ignoring the pain doesn't make it go away. I've said it before - and I'm not pressuring you, okay? I'm not. But just think about how you felt when I was sick, because I let those new emotions overwhelm me, and let everything build up inside me. Do you remember how you felt, then? How much you wanted to help me?" she asked, then pulled back to move a hand to Ellesandra's cheek, looking down at them. "That's how I feel now. That's what the longing you feel in me right now is. It's a longing I felt from the moment I saw how heavy the burdens are upon you of course but...With what I feel for you in my heart now, I can't deny how much more important, how much more personal it's become for me. I'm...Not pushing you into doing or sharing anything. I just need you to know how desperately I want you to see yourself the way that I see you. Because it's so...So beautiful."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. Star was just making a better case for her to NOT share these things. Sure it might not help to push it down, but still. And the beautiful comment just made her snort. Complete disbelief that someone as broken as her could be anything but lust-filled sexy. Beautiful? No, she didn't have what it took, emotionally, to be beautiful to Star. She pursed her lips, turning her head away from Star, and then moving to lay back on her back, rather than cuddled up into her chest. "If it hurts to see me like this, I can't show you those memories, Star." Her heart ached when she said it. The reminder of the pain. She looked away from her, towards the wall. "It was so much worse than now." And not only would Star be experiencing them as they happened, seeing what Ellesandra felt in the moment then, but Ellesandra would be feeling it too. Remembering it. Really feeling all of those emotions again. It would make it worse. She pulled her knees up, resuming the comforting fetal position she normally did when emotionally overwhelmed, though this time with her back to Star rather than cuddled directly into her.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra wouldn't quite get the chance to roll away from Star and into their fetal position. Star was too emboldened by the intensity of her attraction and feelings for Ellesandra now to feel shy or like she didn't have any place with this woman. There would obviously be boundaries that Ellesandra would always have, just as she had her own, but where she very much held herself back in the past, she no longer felt the fear of driving Ellesandra away from her permanently. So when Ellesandra moved onto their back, Star hastily moved on top of the other woman, straddling them as she foresaw their attempts to run away from her. Hands fell on either side of Ellesandra's head rather than their shoulders. The heat between her legs hadn't gone anywhere, but the shift in topics had doused her arousal with a good dose of cold water. It was still there, but it was sequestered to inappropriate prison where it could live until it was done, or until the two of them broke out into sex. Either way. For the moment, she looked down at them, a little misty eyed, but determined. Her brilliant platinum hair spilled over her sides and shoulders, cascading around her to spill down over herself and the knight below. It was long and voluminous, which gave it weight that pulled it into position gracefully. "It hurts because you hurt, Ellesandra," she said, her voice gentle despite the stern look on her face. "It always gets worse before it gets better. And as much as I will always want you to protect me, denying it because it will hurt in the short term is only going to hurt me more in the long term," she said, her lips quivering a little as she made her plea. "I don't want to hurt you either, Ellesandra. Never. But I recognize that ignoring what happened is hurting you right now, and it will never stop unless you face it. So if you tell me you're scared, if you tell me it's too much right now...I hear you," she said, her voice still gentle. A single tear fell from her eyes to drip onto Ellesandra's cheek, then. "But don't you dare think that it'll hurt me more to see it for myself. And don't scoff or snort...Because no matter how hard you try to deny it and say it's impossible and play down how much you mean to me, I already told you...I'm falling in love with you. So I'm not going to stand for anyone insulting you. Not even you." Her voice remained gentle, flaring with strength only when stressing the point about not denying this for HER sake. One more tear fell. The connection between emotions, between auras, remained. And though not perfectly translated in terms of strength, Star's emotions were fully on display for Ellesandra while they touched. Her desires for Ellesandra. This precursor to love. Her fears of losing or being shut off from Ellesandra. Her sympathetic pains for how much the other woman suffered. Her attraction and arousal in its little temporary prison. Mild anger, though not directed at Ellesandra themselves. Frustrations. Hopes. How she could accept that Ellesandra had their limits, but it being because of Star that things repress further? That just brought back a very intense flare of the same emotion Ellesandra felt when Star's aura bloomed out of control and she 'broke' it. That was not a button that Ellesandra wanted to push, unless they wanted Star being pushed over her limits again.


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Well, that hadn't been something she expected. Like, any of that. First, feeling Star move to straddle her...it did things to her. Very aroused things. Even through the haze of the emotional storm and the discomfort, there was an immediate response to this position. Enough that her eyes dilated and she tracked her gaze down Star's front, actively biting her lip to refrain from doing anything. It was tempting, oh so tempting, to reach down and take Star's hips, and grind her down onto Ellesandra. Her hands closed into fists and then opened. Distract Star from these accursed emotional conversations with the desire that was filling them both. If Star was in any way shape or form open to a quick fuck, Ellesandra would have done so. But she respected Star too much to actually try to distract her that way right now. She...cared for Star too much to do that to her. So, Ellesandra took a deep breath and worked to push those desires back down. It took a moment, to get herself back into thinking about what they were talking about. It helped that Star had started talking, reminding her of what they'd been talking about. Even if Ellesandra hadn't distracted the conversation, for a brief second her mind had been distracted from the turmoil. The idea that this would continue to hurt was easily accepted, though the idea of that hurting Star more in the long term sat poorly with her. Suddenly, Ellesandra was craving hot cocoa. Could she have hot cocoa right now? She also didn't want to move from under Star. She wouldn't say it, but she enjoyed Star being on top of her like this way too much - maybe more than cuddling directly into her. Her mind, trying to distract her with things, was once again brought back as she felt the tear drip down onto her own cheek. It caused Ellesandra to take a deep breath, fully refocusing on Star again. The reiteration that she was falling in love with her...her heart ached so much, wanting that. She still felt it was out of reach, not possible for her, but there was no denying she fully wanted it. Wanted to be able to be in love with someone, to be a good partner to them. She slowly raised a hand, feeling the tension and how close Star was to breaking down again. She lightly brushed her hand against Star's cheek, thumb brushing any stray tears still there away. Her eyes were on her cheek, but then met Star's eyes and - and she had to resist the urge to lean up and kiss her. Softly, not with the bruising kiss she'd wanted to do before. Not lust motivated, but...affection. Protecting her, stopping her from crying. Intimate. Ellesandra took another breath. Fuckity fuck fuck fuck. Her eyes closed and she nodded softly. "Okay, Star." The words came out with a resigned, but tentative breath. "Only if you promise me...promise that you will pull out of the memory if it's too much. That you won't stay or focus on it if it will push you over the edge. Okay? Valentina mentioned that the suffering she experiences would be enough to make you or your mother go crazy. I don't - it's not like that but -" But Ellesandra was concerned that it would still effect Star poorly. It might not be on the same level as Valentina experienced constantly because of the curse, but it was still more than she thought anyone should have to experience or go through.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was still very much in control of herself. Her emotions were echoing older emotions, ones that were too much, ones driven by Ellesandra just rejecting everything and, even if she knew Ellesandra didn't mean it as such, rejecting everything that was core to her being. Ellesandra was not the first to just reject emotions and decide they could push them into a box and it would never have any negative repercussions ever, nor would they be the last, but Ellesandra was the first person to do that that she had feelings for. So everything Ellesandra felt became that much more important to her, good, and bad. Rejection hurt. Rejection as fundamental as this belief that emotions could be shut down killed her to feel. Almost literally. She felt the arousal of course. A mental note for another time, if they wanted to actually take that leap, that Ellesandra liked her on top. It made her feel pretty. Feel desired. She liked it, as Ellesandra would feel in turn. But those feelings were kept at the wayside. One small nuance to emotions being fully bared to each other was that there was no hiding the 'oops I'm horny now' moments from each other. Star didn't mind it, but it certainly was...New to her. As so very much about Star had been new to Ellesandra, surely. Not like there were millions of auramancers walking around. But what really resonated with Star, what truly brought happiness to her, was Ellesandra moving a hand to her cheek, and stroking it with their thumb. Oh, how that put to rest any of those dangerous feelings of rejection and pain. The urge to kiss, the urge to be affectionate and intimate was met with nothing but reciprocation. That the fires of affection and eventual love was within Ellesandra's grasp at that very moment could not be more obvious; that is, of course, if all of Ellesandra's self-image and trauma was not taken into account. Those had proven quite effective at making the knight reject this obvious reality. But oh, there was no denying the happiness Star felt at such affectionate, loving, protective touch. She leaned her head into it, moving her own hand up to gingerly press against the back of Ellesandra's hand. Eyes closed. How she wished to just...Sear this moment into her memory, forever. Hearing their agreement and terms, she gently nodded. "I've...Seen some awful things, Ellesandra. I know it will hurt. But I promise you, I will be okay. And that I will stop it all, if I won't be. But please trust me. Emotions are my domain...So even if I cry, even if I shake and tremble...I will be okay. Just promise we can hold each other close, and the storm will pass and leave clearer skies behind."


</p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the response. The approval and the returned romantic feelings. The love. It made her hand shake even as it was on Star's cheek, and being held by Star's own. The fear at feeling this from Star was obvious, but she didn't pull her hand away. Instead she nodded to the confirmation. Ellesandra fully believed Star had seen awful things, and she wasn't going to pretend that her experiences were the absolute worst. Yet she still felt concern for Star at the idea of sharing them. She didn't respond verbally when Star requested a promise in return. Instead, she just slid her hand down from Star's cheek, around her neck and then lightly pulled her down to hold her. One arm would slide behind Star's back, holding her on top of Ellesandra as closely as possible. Their bodies pressed against eachother, but it wasn't a sexual thing. She held Star gingerly, for now anyways. Her eyes closed and she turned her head to lightly press her lips to the top of Star's head, maintaining that pressure as she opened herself up. She worked to do exactly as she'd done the last few times to share memories, though even dredging these ones up to the top of her own mind caused turmoil in Ellesandra. Her heart ached immediately, and her body shook - but she continued. As Star would be drawn into the first memory Ellesandra chose, it was Ellesandra and Marigold sitting in a carriage that was currently going down what appeared to be some forest path, based on what was passing one of the windows. The interior of the carriage was obviously ornate and privileged; soft cushioned seats and benches, a table that was nailed down to the bottom of the carriage, soft carpeted floor, shelves within that had little ties to hold anything placed there. A window on each side and then one to talk to the driver. All of the decorations were the type nobles used, which fit the fact that Marigold was a princess. Both of them looked older than they were in the last memory Star had seen; Ellesandra looked a bit closer to her current age, though without the absolute devastation that had caused her to hold herself with more age and trauma than the current memory. Her hair was up in a ponytail and she was dressed in the same armor she wore in current time. She had a longsword strapped to her left hip, along with a spear propped gingerly in the corner of the carriage and a shield strapped to her back. She looked relatively bored, but was keeping an eye out the window as the trees went by. Marigold was wearing an ornate green dress that contrasted with her red hair well, gold embellishment on the dress adding texture and design. She did have an ornate rapier on her right hip, which looked a bit out of place with the dress but she made it work. Her hair was done up in a braid that circled her head, to make a makeshift hair-braid circlet. It was clipped to itself at the back, to ensure it stayed. She had a book in her lap and was reading silently, a general comfort between the two of them during this silence. One thing Star might notice was the aura of a smaller being, resting in Marigolds stomach. It was still growing, Marigold only being about three months pregnant. Showing a little, but the dress designed to hide this so it wasn't obvious to people who didn't see her constantly. The aura merged into Marigolds, but was also different from hers. The baby was upset about something, but with it being so young in stage being able to tell it was upset alone would be hard, let alone about what. The carriage jolted for a moment as it came to a pause, and the rider gave a specific three knock style to the window. Ellesandra was standing quickly, grabbing the spear and glancing back at Marigold. "Stay here." Marigold had stopped her reading, closing the book and looking up to nod. Ellesandra opened the door and glanced around outside, before stepping out and closing the door shut behind her. She hopped onto the ground and the clank of her armor was heard as she moved to stand near the front of the cart. Ahead of them was a young teen, long hair and a slim body that made it hard to determine their gender. They were pale and looked terrified, wide eyes staring at them. "Please - please! Bandits they - they attacked looking for - for -" They seemed to pause, staring at Ellesandra as if they recognized Ellesandra somehow. There was fear and rage in this individual at seeing Ellesandra, though Ellesandra was just cautious and confused with no recognition for the individual. "Shh, deep breath for me. Tell me what happened, okay?" Ellesandra spoke with authority, one hand raising to show she meant no harm and trying to lower it as if to lower the emotions in the air right now. The person shook their head. "They attacked us looking for you! A royal knight, woman, silver hair. YOU! You have to turn yourself in! They're going to kill everyone!" Confusion continued to swirl in Ellesandra and she tilted her head, looking back behind the person to see if there was anyone else, then back to them. "Who attacked? Why were they looking for me?" "They killed Pa because of you! I don't know but you have to go turn yourself in before they kill more!" Ellesandra held the spear firmly in their right hand now, looking around for a trap again. She was firmly on guard, concerned. "Please - I need to understand who they-" "Ellie, is everything okay?" Marigold asked, having poked her head around the corner of the carriage. Panic rose in Ellesandra and she looked back. "Get back in the carriage! We don't know if-" Marigold was already stepping out carefully, then walking towards them. The frenzied villager looked to Marigold and their eyes widened even more, recognition hitting them. "Princess! Princess Kingsley!" They ran forward, stopped only by Ellesandra's hand roughly on their chest and pushing them back to maintain distance. They took the distance, but then fell to their knees facing Marigold. "Please - please you have to talk with them! They're killing the whole village! They said one villager p..per day that that...that SHE isn't given!" The villager pointed to Ellesandra. Marigold seemed much more capable of addressing emotions than Ellesandra was, as she gave this person a soothing smile. She stepped forward and waved off Ellesandra when Ellesandra went to place herself between them. "They're scared, not planning to kill me Ellie. Stop it." The gentle admonition at Ellesandra's overprotective nature did exactly as it was intended. Ellesandra huffed, grumbling about Marigold not letting her do her job, but took a step back and began looking around again, keeping an eye out for danger or if this villager had been followed. She also kept a close eye on the villager as well, just in case. Marigold leaned forward, placing a hand on the person's shoulder. "Tell me what happened, okay? I promise I will see what I can do to ensure no on else dies." The soothing tone from Marigold seemed to work a little, though there was still obviously panic and grief and loss in the individual. They shifted, looking up to Marigold and then looking down. "The...the village - down the road - Rhineland. They...they attacked this morning. No guards, we - I mean we're an interior village - no one patrols in the early mornings - beasts are sleeping. It's a peaceful town and and - and we don't know where they came form but...but they they -" Marigold seemed to recognize that the person was about to break down and gently shushed them, squeezing their shoulder comfortingly. "Hey, that's okay, just tell me what they wanted, okay? Exactly what they said." The villager looked up, staring at Ellesandra. "They...they said they were looking for - for a warrior. Royal warrior. Silver hair. They said her family grew up in this town and - I ...I don't know anyone like that but -" The person was obviously younger than Ellesandra, and the mention of her family having lived in that town caused both of them to tense. Ellesandra looked at Marigold, confusion swirling. Rhineland was where she was found, after a bandit attack. Marigold, being the one who found her, met her eyes knowingly. It was how she was given her last name - not knowing what it was, and no one being around to corroborate her family name or mention who she was, they named her after the village. "Okay, and did they say what they wanted with her?" Marigold asked softly, still trying to soothe the panic in the individual. Ellesandra was feeling more and more uncomfortable, being on edge was an understatement. The villager shook their head. "N...No they didn't they just - they said whoever delivered her would be...be rewarded and...and until then they would kill...They sent me to spread the w...word." Marigold nodded. "Okay. And if I were to go talk to them, do you think-" "Absolutely not, Marie." Ellesandra cut in, a voice as cold and firm as ever. She was glaring at Marigold now. "You heard them. They're killing people. We fall back and find reinforcements, send the army in to wipe them out of the town." Marigold looked back up to Ellesandra, but before she could say anything the villager shouted. "no! That'll take...that'll take days! They'll kill multiple people by then! You can't!" The same words, though more panickly stated, that Marigold was about to say. She shook her head. "You know I can't just let them die, El. I'm the Princess, I'm a better prize than any of them. If I tell them that we're sending people to get you, and deliver you later, that will buy you time to get the guards you need. And they won't dare kill me, or anyone while I'm in their captivity. Not if they expect to get out of here alive." Ellesandra stood firm, shaking her head. "No, Marigold. You are going to be-" She cut herself off and looked at the villager. The news of Marigold's pregnancy wasn't widespread yet. "You have others depending on you. You are the Princess, that is exactly why you cannot risk yourself like this. It is irresponsible for your position." "So you expect me to just let them kill -" At this point the villager stood quickly, about to lunge at Ellesandra. Ellesandra deftly dodged, kicking their shin in the process and forcing them to fall on their face. Marigold immediately attempted to them. "Hey - go wait in the carriage while I speak with my guard, okay?" They shook their head. "Just turn her in! They'll stop if they have her! Her life for all of the town, it's worth that!" "I'm not going to do that. Hey, will you give me your name? What can I call you?" The villager shook their head. "That doesn't matter! It's her life or the villages! Or yours!" They looked at Ellesandra. "Are you going to let her risk her life over you going down there and giving yourself up?!" Marigold raised a hand, preventing Ellesandra from replying. "She and I both know that if she goes down there, we've given them what they want and there is no guarantee they won't just kill and burn the whole land on their way out. Without her, they have a reason to play by rules. You trust me, right?" The villager looked at Marigold, apparently considering this. Marigold had trust of a lot of the people - she was known for being fair to them, and caring about them. The villager shook their head. "But my family is -" Marigold nodded. "I know, and I'll do everything I can to ensure no one else dies. Okay?" "Marie-" Ellesandra started again but Marigold raised a hand. It stopped Ellesandra's protest in it's tracks, and the villager nodded. "Am...Ambrose. My name is Ambrose. My ma's name is Julia and sister's name is Gina. She's only four. Please don't let her die." Ambrose's voice quivered, breaking on those last words. Marigold pulled Ambrose into a hug and quietly comforted them. "Shhh, come on - go sit in the carriage and let me talk with Ellesandra about our plan, okay?" Ambrose did, glancing back at Ellesandra once. There was a threat of hostility there, a potential consideration of trying to take Ellesandra down themselves and deliver Ellesandra to the bandits. It passed though, with Ambrose realizing pretty quickly that they were far outmatched to a trained knight, who was armed. They climbed into the carriage, trying not to breakdown. Ellesandra was standing, glowering at Marigold furiously. She waited until Ambrose was out of sight before hissing out - "Are you crazy? There is no way I am letting you go down there-" "It's not really your choice, Ellesandra. You're my guard, therefore you have to obey my orders, right?" Ellesandra was...appalled. Marigold had NEVER pulled rank on her before. Not even as kids - they had always been equals in decisions. "Marie, you're joking. You're pregnant, you can't put yourself and the future heir into the hands of bandits-" Marigold crossed her arms. "If you tell me what I can and cannot do one more time I'll grab you by that ponytail and remind you which of us is better at hair pulling. You might beat me in a fight but I can pull your hair until you are begging to let go." There was both joke, and seriousness in Marigold's statement. "We don't have an option. You turning yourself in is obviously not one, because we have no guarantee they won't do anything - plus I'm not willing to give you up. If we head back to send word, countless people will die. We don't have a sending stone, but we can get one in town a day over. That will be a minimum of two days, at least two more deaths, that can be prevented by me going in myself. That is also assuming people are ready to march and get there within a day, which you and I both know won't happen. We're too far away from the capital." Ellesandra pursed her lips, shaking her head. "I would rather go down there myself than send you down there. We don't know how unhinged these people are, whether or not they will care if you're a princess. You're planning to negotiate with people whose motives we don't really know." Ellesandra dropped her voice. "They could even be the people responsible for the attack that left me stranded there. Remember that? They burned the WHOLE village down." Marigold nodded. "They probably are, but I'm willing to take the risk. It's the only choice." Ellesandra had to fight back rage at Marigold's stubbornness. "No, it's not. Either I'm going with you, I'm going alone, or you are not going at all." Marigold glared at her. "You do not get to decide here, Ellesandra. You are going to get back on that carriage and go back to alert my parents, Sia, and collect troops to return and rescue me. If you do not, I will strip you of every rank and privilege you have and throw you into the prison myself for disobeying a direct order." The thing was, Star would be able to see that Marigold was bluffing through her teeth. She wouldn't actually do this, she was just trying to push Ellesandra to obey. Ellesandra, however, didn't see that. Ellesandra felt like Marigold had just taken a knife and stabbed her in the heart. That she could be thrown away so callously, for trying to do her job and protect her. Her mouth hung open, eyes watery and staring at Marigold. "You...you wouldn't. Marie -" "Do not overplay your connection to me, Ellesandra. I would do this with any other guard, why would I not do it with you?" Again, the words were forced out, a bluff. Marigold didn't mean them, but she could tell she was on the verge of getting Ellesandra to agree. She forced it, and Ellesandra felt a flash of fury, pain, and anguish at her words. She was still in love with Marigold, even if she'd kept it hidden and suppressed all this time with Marigold's marriage. Having stood by her as she was married, congratulated her when she was found to be pregnant. All stoicly, all with the excitement a sister or best friend would have. All supportive of Marigold. And now she was throwing that relationship away as if it didn't mean anything? Throwing it in her face that Marigold was a princess, and despite being raised alongside Marigold, Ellesandra was nothing but an orphan. A convenient 'friend' to have in the role, but that was it. Ellesandra's hands shook, but she calmed herself. Repressed it, like she'd repressed her feelings for Marigold. Bundled all of this rage and pain into a box, and looked at Marigold cooly. "Are you sure these are your orders, your majesty?" The change in title was obvious, and Marigold flinched at it. Even having started this, the cold formality in Ellesandra's tone slapped and she wasn't quite as good at repressing or hiding it as Ellesandra was. "Yes." She whispered. Ellesandra lowered her head. "As you command." And without another word, stomped off towards the carriage. This memory would fade. Ellesandra still felt the pain at those words, still didn't realize how much of a bluff it was. But even more, there was regret at allowing it. At not just hauling Marigold back onto the carriage by force, of taking her with her. Of just knocking the villager out so they didn't cause an issue. The pain and regret, and guilt at walking away and letting Marigold walk into the town on her behalf - all of it weighed on her. The blackness would fade into the next memory, where Ellesandra was kneeling in front of two thrones. The king and queen each sat in them, with Sia standing just off behind, hands clasped behind her back. The king looked old, late fifties, with a greying beard and wrinkles all over his face. His own hair was red, but cut short. The Queen had brown hair and looked to be about a decade younger than the King. She also sat much shorter than him, with a pinched face that looked very displeased. The memory came in just as Ellesandra had finished telling them what had transpired, and the absolute fury in the King's aura was enough to almost set fire to it. It was a fury fueled by fear for his daughter, and his Kingdom should something happen to her. "You let her go in?! Ellesandra I knew you were an idiot but you were usually more protective than that!" He snapped out. The queen was more concerned than furious, but the anger at Ellesandra was still there. Sia looked stoic, keeping her mask that she taught Ellesandra well, but Star would be able to see concern - not for just Marigold, but for Ellesandra as well. "Your Majesty-" Ellesandra started, but the King waved her off. "I knew it was a mistake letting her take you in. Filth who cares only about yourself. You let her go into a trap for you because you were too cowardly!" He shouted, standing and taking a step forward. "I ought to have your head and give it to the bandits myself!" Ellesandra shrunk at his words. They struck hard, at a wound she felt raw from Marigold's own words. The King was halted by Sia's words, just as cold and clipped as they always were. Straight to the point and serious. "Killing her won't help at all, brother. If you must punish her, put her to the stockade. She will be useful in getting her back as a bargaining chip." Sia's words did not match her emotions. Sia had panicked when the King had mentioned killing Ellesandra. And she offered an alternative only to play the political game, to speak to what she knew the King would listen to - how to save his daughter. But that had been even more of a slap to Ellesandra, Sia all but throwing her to the wolves as well. "Whipping her wouldn't be enough, dear sister. This is treason. She abandoned her duty and sent her charge into danger without her to save her own skin!" This was not what happened, or even what Ellesandra had said, but he had chosen to interpret things in his own way. Sia responded with the same coolness as before. "We don't know what the bandits want. If they want her alive, providing her head will only anger them and make them more likely to kill her. Ellesandra may have messed up, but leave her to the bandits." The Queen then spoke up as well. "She's right dear, and you know how upset Marigold would be with you if you kill her now. Send her in to get her back and with troops behind her to ensure Marigold's safe return. If she can get out and back, then we'll discuss further punishment then. Until then, she's of more use to us alive." The King steamed, standing to move towards Ellesandra. He glared down at her, the anger completely overcoming in sense he had. His hand came out, backhanding Ellesandra with enough force to send her down to the ground with a grunt. She gasped, but she knew better than to get back up when he was angry like this. He'd only hit her again. He stepped forward, booted foot pressing down onto her right hand. Cracking was heard as he pressed his foot down on it with his full weight. "You let my daughter walk into a trap of bandits who were looking for you. We should have never let her bring you back here. We raised you like our own daughter, like her sister, and you repay her with this cowardice?!" Spittle came form his mouth as he shouted. Ellesandra didn't cry out, but was obviously in physical pain. And, emotional pain. She'd always known the King didn't like her, hadn't approved of bringing her on, but she hadn't realized the animosity was this strong. "Brother. She'll need that hand if she's to help bring Marigold back." Sia now was furious, but it was at her brother. She was holding herself back in the professional way she did, so it wasn't noticeable to anyone but Star watching the scene. Her leash on her emotions, controlling them, was so much better than Ellesandra's. Star would be able to see that unlike Ellesandra, she let herself feel the emotion, and then dismissed it, all while keeping a mask up. Ellesandra just repressed it, not letting herself feel it. Sia put it in a box to feel, but kept it down under the surface where no one could see it - this is why she was so much more successful at maintaining the stoic attitude. The king pulled his foot off and spit on Ellesandra's head, then motioned for guards. "Strip her and throw in the dungeons. Sia, go get the platoon ready to move. Dear, you should reach out to Prince Garret - he should know what is happening to his wife." They went about their duties as needed. Sia walked out, not looking at Ellesandra at all as she did. She knew she'd break face if she did, show concern, and she couldn't afford that in front of her brother right now. Ellesandra had stayed on the floor, trying to control the flood of guilt, the emotional pain at being tossed aside by not only Marigold but also her guardians, and her mentor. The guards at the back looked uneasy about this, but they did follow the King's orders to grab Ellesandra and begin taking her down to the cells. There was obvious pity from them for her, but Ellesandra was too focused inward. And here is where the self blame began. The memory faded to black as she was dragged out of the throne room. In real time, Ellesandra was...distraught. She hated this feeling, the reinforcement to her fault feelings, the self blaming. The physical pain was nothing compared to how distraught Ellesandra had been emotionally. Everyone she knew, was close to, was turning on her. Was ashamed of her. Would have rather she not exist. But there was still hope. Marigold was still alive, at this time. Ellesandra had been hanging onto that hope, that thread of light, that she could save Marigold still. That nothing bad would happen to her. She'd take any punishment for that. But real time Ellesandra knew that didn't happen, so this hit even harder. She knew that this was the last time she'd seen Sia, and that her last words were to throw her away to the bandits. She knew that she would continue to fail to save Marigold, and that to everyone in the room at the time, she would be seen as a traitor. In the real world, as the memory played, she was sobbing into Star's shoulder, holding tightly and physically shaking with each one. The next memory came in with her having already been tied up onto the stockade. Her arms were above her, her hand having been healed just enough that she could use it, but it still hurt. It wasn't fully healed, and if it was left to heal like this it would heal poorly and wrong. The rope binding her wrists above her head was tight, rough and scratchy. She stood on the ground in nothing but dirty leggings, bare feet pressing against the ground with tiptoes to relieve some pressure from her wrists. She was topless, body hunched over, muscles tensed. She was in the center of the courtyard, with a crowd around. Soldiers, guards, people she knew and grew up with. Staff who knew her to love their meat pies, who knew her to be courteous and to help clean up after eating. People she'd trained with, had shifts with, fought beasts with. And then strangers, the random citizens who came to see the traitor whipped, the one who had endangered their beloved princess. The King watched, with a younger man standing beside him - Prince Garret. Garret looked furious as well, arms crossed, and all of his anger and hate being directed at Ellesandra. There was also jealousy there, but it wasn't for her current situation - it was for her previous relationship with Marigold. "You will receive nine lashes - three for each day that you left my daughter to those bandits." The King spoke loudly, magically empowered so that his voice could be heard over the mumbling of the crowd. "You will receive another ten should you return with my daughter alive. Should she be harmed in any way, you will be executed publicly for your cowardice and treason." The reading out of her punishment barely registered to Ellesandra. Her eyes were closed, head bent and preparing to take it without complaint. She fully believed she deserved this, for letting Marigold walk into the bandits. There had been some surprise she was being punished now, before going to get Marigold, but it was immediate to get the soldiers set up to go. The King had found time for this punishment. So for now, Ellesandra was entirely focusing on the idea, the hope, of getting Marigold home safely. Ellesandra in the moment hardly even registered the whip strikes. Nine total, each bringing a flash of physical pain, cutting deep into the skin of her back, but she had been so withdrawn from the moment to hardly feel it at the time. She'd sheltered herself in a singular mindset - saving Marigold. Disassociated in a way, the feeling of the pain was something she'd observed more than felt. Reliving it, current Ellesandra didn't have this courtesy. She clenched her teeth through it, even flinching at the memory of the strikes hitting, but she hadn't been lying when she'd said previous it was the emotional pain, no the physical pain that she'd been worried about. As the last whip strike landed, the King waved for the one striking off. Prince Garret walked up then, snarling at Ellesandra, and saying in a whisper. "If you don't bring her back alive you little bitch, I will have you gutted and skinned. I'll hang your skin on my wall as the hopeless lesbian bitch who let her love die." So at the very least, he'd known Ellesandra's feelings for Marigold. This surprised Ellesandra and she looked up at him, not at the threats but at his knowledge of her feelings. She apparently hadn't hidden it from him, but her looking up was exactly what he wanted. The bruising side of her face from where the King struck her was struck again, this time by the Prince. And then he'd pulled out a knife, in front of the crowd, and slashed her across the back diagonally. She shouted out in pain, this cutting through more because the surprise had brought her back to her body. He grabbed her by the hair and pulled her hair back to force her head up, whispering in her ear. "That you loved her was acceptable because I thought that would make you a better guard for her. Give your life for her. I didn't count on your being so cowardly, though." And then he pulled the knife across her hair, cutting it off halfway. Her head snapped back up as the hair was roughly cut, looking horrible as a hair cut and only going down to her shoulders now, versus lower back as it had before. As people began to disperse, a guard came to untie her and carry her back to her cell. With him was Sophia, who was obviously filled with concern for Ellesandra in her emotions, but she kept the same stoic face on so no one thought she'd give any special treatment to a prisoner. The flames of love weren't there anymore, like last time Star had seen her, but there was still affection there. She helped the guard haul Ellesandra down to the cells, then waved the guard off. "I've got to heal her before she gets ready to leave, at least a little, or she will be of no use to anyone." The guard, who also knew Ellesandra, didn't disagree or protest. He moved to give them some privacy near the door, still on guard technically but far enough away they could whisper at least. To him, this was a lover's meeting, with healing as an excuse. "I don't believe it, El." Sophia said, shaking her head. "What they're saying. I know you. You wouldn't run from danger." She was beginning to step up to heal Ellesandra, but Ellesandra brushed her off. "No." She didn't respond to the words, just the attempt to heal. She also wouldn't meet Sophia's eyes. She was almost broken, hanging on by a thread of hope, but she was still there. Yet, she wanted the scars. Wanted the pain. Thought she deserved it. A form of self-punishment for her actions. "Ellesandra, you have to heal them if you're going into battle tomorrow. You can't fight like this." Ellesandra didn't respond verbally but just shook her head. "You're a stubborn bitch. I don't know what happened between you and the Princess, but you're going to let me touch up your wounds or I'm going to knock you out and do it anyways." Ellesandra just held out her injured right hand. Sophia grunted and began the work of magically healing it, which was just as hard as it was for Star. She did just enough to ensure it would heal decently on it's own, and that it wouldn't hinder Ellesandra in fighting, but she didn't fully heal it. She knew the deal already with Ellesandra, and was used to using just enough magic to get by since every bit of healing took a lot more. When she reached for Ellesandra's back, though, Ellesandra swatted her away again. "Oh for fucks sake's El, I don't have the magic to fully heal them anyways. Just let me close them up so you don't get infected." Ellesandra still didn't move, so Sophia reached out and slammed the palm of her hand into Ellesandra's temple. It sent Ellesandra tumbling, but it wasn't particularly painful. It was done with a practiced hand, someone who knew how to stun and disorient an opponent without causing real harm. Sophia took the opportunity to move around and begin healing her back, throwing more magic into it than she did the hand to get it done quickly before Ellesandra recovered. Like she said, she didn't have enough to force the healing all the way, but she at least closed the wounds. The wounds closed with scars, and she didn't have enough time to heal them because as soon as Ellesandra recovered she jerked away again, snarling. "Get the fuck away from me!" Ellesandra was lashing out, her own stress and pain and turmoil enough to prevent her from realizing that Sophia wasn't actually an enemy. Was on her side, here. Was trying to help, didn't believe that she was a traitor. But Ellesandra believed she was a traitor, and deserved these wounds. They still ached, but a lot less than before and she hated that. Sophia snorted. "Fine. I'll have your armor and weapons sent down here to prepare. Bitch." Star would see the bitch was said affectionately though. The type of thing she'd probably called Ellesandra all the time, teasingly or when annoyed at her stubbornness. They had become decent friends, even if Ellesandra wasn't acting like it right now. She was too busy wallowing in guilt, self admonition, self hatred, and the hope that Marigold was still alive. The regret for listening to her and walking away. The memory faded, and the next one, the last one, was what Ellesandra feared. The one she was trying to brace herself for. The one that had tipped that almost broken Ellesandra over into...the shell that she was when Star met her. The memory came to with Ellesandra, armored and with her gear, being shoved forward by her guards. Her hands were tied, and she looked back at them. The town of Rhineland was in front of them, portions of it burnt. Surely, the bandits had already seen her and were reporting back. She held her hands up, but the guards waved it off. "We're giving you to them as a gift for the princess. We're here to ensure that trade happens, so you've got five minutes then we're coming in." The question crossed her mind, why they bothered arming her and giving her armor when they were going to have her tied up going in, but she didn't argue. Her hands were tied together, but if she really needed to she could free them with her sword. It meant leaving her spear behind, and her shield on her back would be useless right now, but whatever. She walked forward, preparing herself for what she thought would be the worst - her death, for Marigold's safety. The town seemed abandoned, and Ellesandra looked around - on guard the whole time. Her chopped hair was dirty, but her armor was relatively clean. Her face was still bruised and her eye swollen, but she could see through it. There was some pain from her hand, but minimal. Her back was screaming from the constant jostling with the armor, but Ellesandra enjoyed this pain. Used it to focus herself on redeeming the mistake she'd made earlier, of letting Marigold win that argument. Of walking away in anger and hurt. She stopped when she heard a man call out, and turned just in time to see someone come up behind her. When had that happened? She wasn't on her game, being distracted and in pain, and a bat collided with the back of her head. She toppled, face first, and her vision went dark. When it came to again, she was without weapons, tied up with her hands behind her back this time, and laying in front of a 6'8 Goliath man. Water had been splashed on her face to wake her up, and she blinked, looking around to get her bearings. "So you're the Mage Killer." The man said, grey skin covered in scars and calluses. He was hardly wearing anything, just a type of chieftain's skirt to cover his bits, leaning over her. Even as she moved to a standing position, he totally towered over her. Ellesandra looked up at him, but then began looking around again for Marigold. She was surrounded by bandits, and she saw a cage over in the corner with the townsfolk in it. Within she saw a glimpse of the green dress, but it was covered quickly by other villagers. The Goliath followed her gaze, and a wide smirk crossed his face. The pure evil in this man, the glee and joy he got out of torturing people, was obvious without even using auramancy. And the sheer terror, despair coming from the cage - everyone in it, but also Marigold - would be felt by Star. Ellesandra's concern skyrocketed. "Marie!" She shouted, but then was slapped, again in the same damn spot, by the Goliath. Unlike the King or prince, this slap did more than just knock her off her feet. The strength behind it broke her jaw and she groaned in pain as she hit the ground, the Goliath grinning down at her. "I need you alive girl, but not in one piece. Awfully kind of you to send your princess in for me and my boys to have some fun with before you got here though." The implication was clear and despair filled Ellesandra. Hatred at herself, for letting Marigold walk in, filled her. Not even anger at the man, for doing it, or the bandits. Or Marigold, for insisting it. No, she should have known better. The king knew that, the Queen did. Sia knew that. Everyone knew that she should have been a better guard, should have put her foot down. And this is what happened to Marigold because she didn't. She groaned, trying to sit up and look for Marigold, ensure she was alive at least, when she saw one of the bandits had been motioned to bring her out. Marigold was dragged out, bruised, bloodied, and with her dress obviously ripped in places it really shouldn't have been. Yet unlike Ellesandra, she still had fight in her for them. She kicked at the bandits, but was quickly restrained and thrown to the ground next to Ellesandra. She had fight in her, but there was obvious fear. She was fighting because she thought she had no choice but to fight or die, but it didn't mean she wasn't terrified, and hated everything about this. Ellesandra stared at her, the panic, dismay, pain, guilt washing through her. "S..sowry.." The word came out wrong because of her broken jaw, and damn did it hurt to speak, but she was so, so sorry for letting Marigold get here. Marigold, on her part, was just furious. "Where the fuck is the army El-" She was kicked again, this time in the stomach. There was still an aura inside, but it was...weak. Alive, but struggling with this abuse. "Now now, language Princess." The Goliath shook his head, then turned to look at Ellesandra. "She offered herself in exchange for us treating the villagers well, you know. Over and over again. All night these past few nights." Ellesandra's dismay, fear, pain, guilt, turned to anger. Anger at him, rage at herself, and absolutely terror at what she was hearing. Terror for Marigold, and what she must have been through. She leaned forward, trying to strike at a weak spot in his knee with her forehead, but he just moved away from her. In her weakened state, she might have her armor but not her weapons, and she couldn't truly do much to fight him. He laughed. "Feisty. Well, if you behave, we can get this over with quickly. I'll even spare the villagers, because your Princess here has been so accommodating." He said this like he was doing them a huge favor. "We're here for your power, girly. Your parents refused to give it to us and, well, we burned the place down. How lucky it is that you survived, and came into the power on your own. Now, we get a second chance." He held his hand out, and another one of the bandits came forward, holding out a small box. It looked even smaller in his hands, like a child's toy almost. He opened it, then pulled out a small crystalline sphere. "You see, I've been collecting unique magical powers. Powers that would allow me to draw upon them, to use them when I need them. A perfect power for each enemy, each situation. And yours my dear, is one of the strongest against magic users I've ever heard of." He grinned down at her, then reached down and grabbed Marigold by the throat. He hefted her up, holding her up easily despite her kicking and yanking, large meaty hands easily wrapping around her small neck. "Now, you're going to put your hand on this crystal, and will your powers into it. When that's done, I'll return your princess to you, and you may leave. Understood?" Ellesandra stared up at them eyes wide at Marigold. She nodded, not risking speaking right now, but Marigold choked out past her partially blocked airway. "N-no he won't-" And then marigold was slammed into the ground, tossed roughly by the man like she were nothing but a stick. She gasped, still alive but obviously in pain, and the Goliath laughed. "No no Princess. You've served your purpose up to now. Continue to be a good girl and do so and I might spare you." Ellesandra was numb. Terror for Marigold, pain, self hatred, guilt, but Marigold was still alive. There was still a chance to get her out of this alive. She had been staring at Marigold on the ground, making sure she was still breathing, when the Goliath spoke again. "I won't ask a second time, girl. Do it, or I'll kill her right now." He picked up a large, curved greatsword, holding it one hand and above Marigold. Ellesandra turned, not needing to be told twice. She reached for the crystal, but as she did arrows shot out of the nearby buildings, landing into some of the bandits - and this goliath. The goliath mostly shrugged them off, not really sinking in enough through thick calloused skin to do much damage, but his bandits began dropping. Ellesandra panicked as she realized - her lead time was over. And at the worst possible moment. In a rage, the Goliath lowered his sword onto Marigold's head. She'd been looking up, to see where the arrows were coming from, confused. She'd barely had time to look back to see the sword coming down on her head, and no time dodge. Ellesandra had thrown herself with a shout at Marigold, but it was no use. Too much distance, and her injuries, and tied up, and just...she couldn't make it. The blade split Marigold's skull, crushing and cutting into her head. She was dead, instantly, dropping to the ground as her blood and...other things dripped off the blade. Yet, this wasn't the moment Ellesandra broke. The entire world seemed to slow down around Ellesandra. Her eyes had widened, her mouth opened, shouting despite the broken jaw. Rage absolutely filled Ellesandra. She didn't even feel grief yet, didn't even register what it meant that Marigold was dead. All she felt was a blinding white hot rage at this man for daring hurt Marigold like this. She'd been angry before, when hearing that he'd assaulted her, hit her, and threw her to the ground. But killing her? Even if her brain hadn't register what it meant that he killed her, that it meant she was dead, her brain absolutely rebelled at the idea of this man being alive. She threw herself forward, twisting and slamming her roped hands into the mans blade as she went. It was sharp, and cut right through them - and also deep into her right arm on the way. She didn't care. There was one focus and one focus only in all of Ellesandra's being - killing this man. The fight around her went unnoticed. The bandits being taken down by arrows, running out to fight the king's guard that were starting into the city. Just enough to slow them down, for Ellesandra to take care of the Goliath. She grabbed the nearest weapon she could find, which happened to be a longsword from one of the downed bandits, and then threw herself at the Goliath. In her rage, she wasn't fighting with the skill she normally would, yet she still fought with more skill than most. The practice and muscle memory of someone who knew what they were doing with the sword, even if it wasn't her number one weapon. She wielded it in her right hand and effortlessly cast a spell with her left, sharpening the blade to a sheen with a blue magic that made it chip into the Goliath's own magical blade when it blocked her blow. Another flick of her left hand and haste was cast at absolute full power. Star would have never seen her go all out with her haste, since it cost so much from her body, but there was nothing else for Ellesandra to fight for than this. The toll it took on her body was immediately noticeable to the aurmancer, how it literally drained every ounce of physical strength she had for the power of speed. She ducked into the goliath's guard and cut his rib, surprised at how he, somehow, kept up with her. Not enough to dodge the blow, but enough to make it only a scratch. And then he was swinging his blade at her. The difference was, Ellesandra didn't care if she died. She raised her blade to deflect some of it, but the sword still cut deep into her right arm. Strong enough to crush her armor and cut through it, deep enough to cut tendons, muscle. She didn't feel pain though. She continued forward, like one of the shadow creatures created by Valentina, and simply moved her blade to her left hand to sink it into the man's chest. Just a bit too far to her left, to his right. It sunk in, but didn't hit his heart - he'd moved just in time. He yanked away, pulling the sword from her grasp with it still in him, and roared as he pulled it out. And then he stabbed it straight through Ellesandra's right shoulder, piercing all the way through armor on both sides. Ellesandra let it happen, having picked up the next weapon already. Marigold's rapier, having been laying on one of the bandits who had apparently taken it from Marigold before. She didn't recognize it, not at first. She drove the point up, through the man's eye, and out the back of his head - the blue magic surrounding it to ensure it pierced even through his thick skull bone. He gasped, falling backwards and dying by the time he hit the ground. Ellesandra had fallen with him, awkwardly pointing her sword up that high to hit him while holding onto it still for dear life - as if the fight was the only thing keeping her going. She fell onto him with a grunt, but he was unmoving. The crystal was gone, she had no idea where - lost in the mess of this fight. The pain of the sword through her shoulder was hardly noticed as her mind finally clicked in. Marigold. She screamed, turning to find her and crawl to her. THIS was when she broke. The pain, the grief, the guilt. It slammed into her like the goliath's weight did to the ground - no, stronger. She gasped, unable to bear it and staring at her, screaming through her broken jaw, through the pain, the wail of someone who had just lost everything. It was Sophia who found her first, the bandits dispatched and the guards coming in. Ellesandra was kneeling over Marigold's body, head on her shoulder and screaming into the remnants of her dress. Marigold's face was a bloody mess, almost unrecognizable. But Ellesandra's head was resting on her chest. Her unbeating heart. And she didn't know what to do. Everything was...bad. Her grief overwhelming. She literally could not process or handle it. Sophia touching her shoulder, pushing her up enough to remove the blade from her, healing her wound just enough she wouldn't bleed out on both parts of her arm. None of this registered. She shouted for Sophia to save Marigold, but Marigold was far too far gone to be saved. Sophia held her, as she cried and directed soldiers to collect Marigold and take her away. The child within, too, dead. The memory blinked for just a moment, enough to show that some time had passed, but not much. And then Sophia was pushing a completely stunned, shell of an Ellesandra out of a camp in the night. A new set of armor, a rapier, and some basic supplies. Sophia was saying things like Ellesandra couldn't come back, that it was a death sentence, that she had to go. Ellesandra just...existed. Disassociative, she was not in there. It would take weeks before she wasn't just a walking shell again. Weeks of slowly coming back ot herself, then crying, then disassociating again, and then coming back to herself. Weeks of repressing all of these feelings to the point that she created the mountain that Star had found her with. The memory didn't go with that though. Just with Ellesandra walking away from the camp, from Sophia, in a state not unlike a zombie. Still injured, her arm and back to the point that Sophia didn't have the magic to be able to heal it. And as the memory ended, Ellesandra in current time...she was a wreck. 'Ugly crying' was an understatement. She was all but actually wailing into Star's body, just as she'd done on Marigold. The guilt, the pain and grief, the shame that had come with everyone turning their back on her - it all was hitting again, fresh, anew. And she did not have any of the faculties to properly process it, on the edge of disassociating again now.


</p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It had been...So much to process. To anyone else, it would have been too much. To an auramancer, this was the prime domain. The single battlefield that auramancy stood peerless and unchallenged. This degree of pain, of suffering. It was someone's greatest pain, distilled into memory after memory with no break, no pause, no time to process any of it. There was a whole range of emotion in Star as she relived this memory with Ellesandra. Some happiness early just in seeing Ellesandra in a state that was not broken, but there was next to no happiness through the rest of the memory. Flickers of it, when seeing that Sia still cared. When Sophia still cared. When Sophia put their life on the line to help Ellesandra escape. Sophia might have died for that. A testament to true friendship, perhaps love, though that had not been visible to Star if Sophia still had any love left for Ellesandra, any romantic affection, whatever it was to them, at the end of it all. There were considerations that kept Star from breaking - namely, that she found this all to be an unfortunate series of events that had no one specific fault, but least of all did she find Ellesandra at fault. There was rejection in her heart at all the points where Ellesandra was feeling like this was their fault. No. Star's whole existence screamed in defiance of that notion. She had to think carefully about how to talk to Ellesandra about this, but...When she rose free of the trance of the shared memory, Star was a ball of adrenaline and pain. She had braced for it. It was not HER anguish she felt right now, but Ellesandra's. These things helped. But it was still so, so, so, SO strong. Ellesandra had been right to be worried, for Star was shaking and crying right back into Ellesandra. Crying...But. Not. Broken. Ellesandra fought for her, each and every day, with everything they had. Star wasn't about to let this moment of trust, this moment of Ellesandra letting her into the deepest parts of their heart, be a moment of weakness for her. There was an outpouring of affection, of soothing, of care, and romantic protectiveness that flooded from Star. She was on top of Ellesandra still, there for them to hold, and in turn she held them more tightly than she'd ever held anyone. Not enough to be painful or make it hard to breathe, but with tense muscles that held firmly and refused to let go. Refused to budge an inch. Ellesandra needed her now, more than ever, and she was going to be there, to hold them while they cried, and make sure no amount of self-torture could ignore that, even if Star was crying with them, Ellesandra was not alone, not would they ever be alone again. Star understood why many of those around Ellesandra made the decisions they did. There had even been a tiny flicker of admiration for Marigold when they made the selfless decision to go ahead and trade their life for two villagers. That was the price. Two villager lives. But this was where Star and Marigold diverged; while Star would make the same choice, that was only because Star had a magical power that nobody ever expected or knew anything about. She could enter dangerous situations and, if she had been where Marigold had been, she could have had that sword bounce off her aura at that critical moment, and Ellesandra could have saved her. But even then? In the same shoes? She'd recognize the deaths of two people as the smarter, tragic option. And Star would never...Never...NEVER spit lies about her feelings like Marigold or Sia did. These were thoughts that flushed through her as she wept against Ellesandra. That if...If people had just been honest, if Marigold had trusted Ellesandra over their own self-sacrificing thoughts, if Sia had stood against the king, or at LEAST found a moment to speak to Ellesandra again after the fact, then maybe Ellesandra wouldn't have been so broken when Star found them. In the moment, she had senseless, reactionary hate for so many of these people. Time would temper that and let her see that she didn't hate any of them - except the king and queen maybe - for trying their best in a horrible situation. But in the immediate? She imagined herself standing before the king, aura blazing, to give him a thorough verbal lashing; this just redoubled that deep, romantic protectiveness she felt for Ellesandra, keeping the woman held tight as the two worked through this depth of emotion together. Because it was together. Star wouldn't let Ellesandra face it alone.

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">
  
  Ellesandra couldn't stop the sobbing if she'd tried. She was physically and emotionally a mess. Absolute devastation, having let herself live through this moments again, fully open up that mountain and let the memories and the grief and the shame and the guilt, all flowing in. It was like she had been, anew, tossed aside by Marigold. Shown that she'd been nothing to her, able to be 'fired' at a moment's disagreement. Then thrown away by her guardians, made to feel how worthless she'd been to them and everyone. Her mentor - and the closest thing she had to a mother - telling the King that she deserved lashings as punishment and agreeing with him that she was a coward. Sia not being able to look at her. That, and what the King said to her, were what had really cemented into her mind that she had fucked up. She'd regretted leaving Marigold behind the moment the carriage had started to leave, but it wasn't until then that she'd really let it set in how bad it was. How stupid she'd been to just leave, regardless of the consequences. How in danger Marigold was. And Sia's disappointment had only cemented even more how worthless Ellesandra was if she couldn't even do that one job right - guard Marigold. She cried the pain of the whips, the words and the knife cut from Garret, the shame of that public punishment in front of all of her peers and old friends, she cried it all out into Star's shoulder. Letting herself remember all of these things, the physical and emotional pain, the mental torture it had been waiting in that cell until it was time to go. Ellesandra hadn't even shown that, how she'd dwelled on it the entire time, the reaffirmation of her mental shadows. And then they'd gotten to Marigold. The knowledge that Marigold not only died because Ellesandra had let her go off like this, but had also had her last hours being torture. Abuse, both sexually and physically. How broken Marigold must have been. And the realization, which hadn't even come until later, as she'd travelled alone and in one of the rare moments she wasn't entirely disassociated...that Marigold's child had been lost, too. That Ellesandra had not just caused the death of Marigold, but the baby as well. That the Kingdom was now without a blood heir, because of her mistake. That Marigold, the woman who had shown her such kindness all of her life, who she'd fallen for long before this happened, was dead due to her inaction. That Sophia, if she had been caught, had probably been executed for letting her go. Ellesandra cried, and cried. She wasn't going to be consolable for a while, the absolute enormity of the emotions too much for her to really handle. It became obvious why she'd never let herself handle these before. The only thing that was stopping her from going into a dark spiral of self blame, hate, and the desire to no longer exist was Star, holding her and crying with her. In the back of her mind there was added guilt, at how Star was responding to all of this, worry that it had been too much, but that was too small of a thing to be able to focus on compared to everything else. She would cry until her body could no longer produce tears anymore, until she was just holding onto Star tightly, muscles aching from doing it for so long, and burying her face into a soaked-with-her-tears shoulder. Ragged gasps and breaths came in the place of tears, sobbing without actually crying, and the grief and exhaustion that came along with that.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was so much to process, so much to let flow through their hearts. It was a fierce enemy but...Not one Star was backing down from. This was Ellesandra's turmoil, and though Star certainly felt it empathetically through her auramancy, she had been trained from a young age by her mother how to separate her emotions and someone else's. A challenge unique to auramancers, as for someone like Ellesandra, the work was done for them by Star's own magic, given she could do so for herself. So it was, Star was the first to stop crying, and recover from this cyclone of pain. She raised herself up just slightly so she could press her forehead against Ellesandra's and move her hands to cup both of their cheeks, thumbs rubbing at their red, teary face to try and soothe them. Her eyes were closed for a while, her breaths still hot and shaking and ragged and pained. But she was getting better. She was recovering. She let it flow through her. She took on all of Ellesandra's pain with a defiant, 'do your worst' attitude. And it hurt. But ultimately, Star was victorious in the face of it. And now that it was done, now that she had let those emotions flow through her, she moved to her concern for Ellesandra, the need to comfort them with everything that she had. She didn't know what to say, though. Did she cry out how it wasn't Ellesandra's fault? How could she prove that? She had her opinion, but that was just her opinion. She couldn't tell Ellesandra that she wasn't the only one who felt that way. She couldn't tell Ellesandra that Marigold was just bluffing, and how much it hurt them to reject the knight. If there was ever a time she would have wanted to break that rule Ellesandra had drawn, it was here. But...She didn't. "Gods above, Ellesandra," she said, whispering. "I'm so sorry for everything that happened..." She spoke in pained whispers, punctuated by a small hiccup of a gasp. Her arms were numb and tingling, but she still cradled Ellesandra's face tenderly. "There's so much I wish I could say to you about all of that...But all my heart can scream is that it wasn't your fault...Gods, I cannot scream loud enough that you aren't to blame for that, Ellesandra..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">Ellesandra closed her eyes tight when Star moved away enough to grab her face. She couldn't look at Star right now. The shame was too much. Her jaw was clenched and she was trying to fight back the grief again, instead of fully feeling it. Fight it back to the point that it was manageable, at least. To the point where she wasn't just a puddle of tears. Ellesandra took in long, gasping breaths akin to Star's own, even as Star had already calmed a little and was trying to just comfort her now. The affection and pain and desire to protect Ellesandra and all of that she felt from Star did help a little, but as soon as she started talking... Ellesandra shook her head, refusing the apology from Star. Not that Star was apologizing as if she were at fault but - still. There was nothing for Star to be sorry for, it had been Ellesandra's fault, her mistake. And when Star tried to tell her it wasn't? Every ounce of Ellesandra's being denied that. In fact there was a little bit of anger at Star for that, which was a nice change from the overwhelming grief and shame she was feeling. Ellesandra pulled away from her hands and turned her head. "How the hell can you see that and not say it's my fault?" The words came out extremely raspy, rough, from all of the crying. She sounded like she'd been punched in the windpipe, but she didn't care. There was...indignation, confusion and outrage at Star just denying that. And then pain at herself for even thinking that this would somehow make it better. It was making it worse. She should have just kept it all bottled up neatly like she'd had before. And thus, began Ellesandra trying once again to pull away from Star, to distance herself, to slip out from beneath her and move away.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star rose up more fully and slammed her hands down on the pillow on either side of Ellesandra's head. "Because I can see things you CAN'T!" she shouted, suddenly struck by another wave of shuddering tears. She choked them back, trying to regulate her breathing. "Things I can't tell you about, that could change your WHOLE perspective on this, but are things that are not mine to share!" she said, her frustrations building as she raised her voice at Ellesandra. Something she had very rarely done. "And it KILLS me to see how much this hurts you! How I KNOW you would have done what you originally wanted to do and dragged Marigold away if she hadn't HURT you the way she had. I KNOW she meant well. I KNOW how bright that desire can burn to help others - You've seem ME do the same sort of reckless thing for Lisanna, but I KNEW I WOULD COME OUT ALIVE!" she shouted, breaking into tears again. It was hard to say all this, hard to fight Ellesandra. But she didn't think this barrier was going to break with her usual tender approach. Ellesandra had spent years torturing themselves about this. It wasn't going to break easily. "Damn it, Ellesandra! I'm not just saying this because of how I feel for you!" she shouted, hands curling into fists as hatred boiled in her heart again, plenty for Ellesandra to feel. "I saw everything beautiful about you in your past self, and I just want to SCREAM at all of those people for how they blamed you because they couldn't stand up against the king on his warpath to take any excuse to punish you!"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't know what she'd expected, but Star slamming her hands into either side of Ellesandra and shouting at her had not been it. Ellesandra flinched. The response was immediate, even if logically Ellesandra knew Star wasn't like them. Wasn't going to hurt her, lash out at her and punish her for what she'd done. How fresh those memories were, the reminder of the whips, the King stepping on her hand, the threat from the prince. Ellesandra curled up beneath Star, making herself as small as possible. This would be the first time Star had ever seen her fully retreat from what was, at the moment, being perceived a physical threat. The shouting, well. Ellesandra didn't even fully process what was said. The words were supposed to be supportive, to force Ellesandra to think about whether it was really her fault, but the only thing going through Ellesandra's head with Star yelling? 'I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry'. Without her normal protective 'mountain', the feelings repressed, the trauma down where it wouldn't effect her actions majorly, Ellesandra was...vulnerable. Very vulnerable, in regards to feeling like everything she did was bad. Everything she did was her fault, and that she truly just brought devastation with her. She choked out a broken - "I'm sorry" and turned her head away from Star, her face twisting up in a broken, pained mask of new shame. Of having done whatever it was that brought Star to this level now. Of feeling that hatred from Star, though in her vulnerable and overwhelmed mind she thought that hatred was for her - not for Marigold, the King, or Sia. And that broke her, again.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the reaction to her outburst. She had been blinded by overwhelming protectiveness for Ellesandra that she had failed to see how logic was really not the right answer here. At least not in the heat of the moment. She was still human, despite her gift. So upon feeling the fear, upon feeling how Ellesandra reacted? The hate vanished. Immediate guilt, guilt that could rival Ellesandra's own, built up inside Star and choked her throat closed for a moment. Sorry? Why was Ellesandra sorry? "N...N-Nonononono, no, no!" she said, her voice no longer shouting, now broken and filled with immense regrets. "No don't apologize!" she said, tears and guilt and shame flaring in her as she realized what she had done. "No, Ellesandra, it isn't your fault!" she choked out again, sobbing, sadness and guilt now consuming her as she hovered above the knight, her tears streaming from her eyes to land on Ellesandra again.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't respond when Star immediately switch her tone. Unlike Star, she couldn't just...switch emotions like that. She was overwhelmed, unused to handling emotions as strong as this, and now having a new level of shame for...what for? For doing whatever it was that had caused Star to hate her. Was it that Star blamed her too? That was the most logical explanation of it, that she'd shared these memories with Star and Star had realized how horrible Ellesandra was. And that idea, in the mind of a vulnerable, depressed person already, stuck. So even as Star began telling her not to apologize, even as Ellesandra could feel the regret and guilt flare in Star too, she just couldn't make sense of these new emotions from her. She COULD make sense of the idea of Star hating her, because of her letting Marigold die. Marigold and the child. She turned to the side, forcing Star up a little if she was still directly straddling her hips, and pulled her knees up into as close of a fetal position as she could manage. Her hands and arms came up to cover her face, hiding herself from Star above her, shielding herself from what she perceived was her hatred now that these memories, Ellesandra's greatest regret and shame, had been shared. She felt her own regret, at giving in and sharing them, and even more hatred for herself. Overall, Ellesandra was fully withdrawing again. Going into her shell, her self-protective attempt to cope with the overwhelming self-hatred and regret and grief and shame. She was becoming numb under it all again, almost like a switch as her mind tried to protect itself from all of this. Where something in her survival instincts said 'this is too much, enough' and she just...lay there. Existing. Probably a strange feeling for an auramancer to feel someone go from such strong emotions to just...numb. Like she'd been when Sophia pushed her into the woods, at the end of the memory. The zombie of a person she was then.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star shifted when Ellesandra moved to lay on their side and curl up. Star moved behind them, immediately curling up behind them in a spooning cuddle. Regret. Strong, immediate regret. The hatred was gone. She didn't care about any of those people anymore. She didn't care about the past. She cared about Ellesandra, here, now. Her affections for them, her intense adoration and how she was still falling in love with Ellesandra was what she focused on. She felt words weren't reaching them. Words had been a mistake. Shouting had a been a worse mistake. So instead she clutched them again, holding them tight like she had when the memory had been shared, and shuddered with overwhelming regrets and guilt. Now, it was Star saying it. More than just thinking it, she could only choke through her sobs, again, and again: "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't really hear her. There was a shift when she felt Star press against her, cuddling close and holding her, but only barely. A shift in that Star would feel an emotional response, but on the surface? Nothing. Ellesandra was just laying there, staring into the other side of the room, eyes centered on the wall. Her breathing had stabilized, no tears or anything happening. She was just....there. Internally, emotionally, the pain was dulled. It was still there, the shame and guilt, the depression, it was all still there. But it was as if someone had taken a foggy piece of glass and placed it between Ellesandra and the actual feelings. It was there, but hardly noticeable. The feelings she felt for Star, however, were oddly more noticeably felt. The guilt and regret, the sadness at what had happened, these were felt like they normally would be from Star. And...they helped. That Ellesandra could tell Star was truly sorry for having responded how she did. It didn't fully bring Ellesandra out of her current shell, but it helped. There was movement from Ellesandra, just a little pressing back into Star, but it would take time for her to fully come back to herself - if she even would tonight. She would need to be dragged back into herself, woken from the forced disassociation.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star held Ellesandra for a while. How long? It was hard to tell. She was there for quite some time before she could focus on anything that was not just how guilty she felt. Desperation to express the guilt she felt was creeping into her mind, and it had her considering options that she might know in the back of her head she might regret, but she also could not let this be the end. She could not allow this to be how her first chance at love died. She could not let this die because she never wanted it to die; if this was to be love, if this was to be where her heart led her, she didn't even want to think about second love. First, and only love, is what she desired, and so the thought of Ellesandra hating her for what she had just done brought about a desperate plea in her heart, one that had her aura flaring in response with a surge of mana. Energies that enveloped the both of them and, if Ellesandra proved entirely passive, would pull the pair of them into a trance. Into the dreamy state of flowers at the depths of their hearts, so they could speak with their hearts, unburdened by the tornadoes of guilt around them both. Ellesandra could resist easily. But if they did not, they would fall into calming white and wake up in that same pristine white gossamer dress in the field of flowers, with their guilt and shame and sorrows floating off and away from them as they had before.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't resist, not in the type of state to be able to resist or encourage this at all. When she was pulled into this trance again, the Ellesandra that appeared just...stood there. Looked around. She wasn't disassociated here, but she still knew something was wrong. She might not be feeling those feelings right now, might not be overwhelmed and broken in this trance, but she still knew what had happened. It was an odd feeling, this difference in knowing that things were really bad right now, that she was on the edge of going too far into her depression, but...just not feeling all of that right now. She stared down at her dress again, still confused why her trance always defaulted to dress here. She didn't do anything about it, but she was actively trying to avoid looking at or for Star. Unlike last time where she actively sought Star out, she wasn't sure what to expect from doing that this time. This time, she was content to just...stay in the calmness. Pretend what was happening outside of this world wasn't, pretend that she wasn't actively afraid of what she'd done to Star, or how Star felt about her. Here, she could recognize that she'd probably over reacted, but that didn't change that she was still...uneasy. There was no hate towards Star - even in her troubled heart outside of the trance - but...caution was definitely there. She sat, crossing her legs and keeping her eyes down so she wasn't looking around or accidentally meeting Star's eyes, if she were here. And Ellesandra reached out, picking a flower out of the ground, and holding it in front of her. To smell, to twirl. And then, without speaking, she began to collect multiple of the flowers, intent on creating a small flower circlet like she'd done as a little girl.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was peace and calm here all around Ellesandra. Well, until Star showed up that is. Star had been the one to actively search out Ellesandra, so unless Ellesandra directly cast her away, Star appeared some twenty feet away. And all was calm...Except directly above Star. If the moment wasn't so dour, it might be comical how Star appeared with her own personal thundercloud above her head that poured rain down on her, drenching her in rain as the occasional soft boom of thunder and crack of lightning could be seen in the person-sized cloud above her. Thankfully, her white dress didn't turn transparent even when wet. She approached Ellesandra, but stopped a respectful distance away, looking her absolute lowest. She was crying, not that Ellesandra could tell with the rain. But her face was twisted into the absolute saddest, most guilt-ridden expression she'd ever worn. That Star was feeling like an absolute pile of trash for how she reacted couldn't really be more obvious. She looked at Ellesandra, unsure for the moment what to do or say.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked up when she heard the thunder. Her eyes took a moment to inspect the rain cloud, pouring on Star, and then Star's crying face. Hesitance was still there, but she didn't seem to be afraid of Star, like she'd been immediately after Star slammed her hands on either side of Ellesandra's head. She watched silently, but her heart tugged towards Star. The need, the want, to go to Star and comfort her was strong. Despite not being sure how to handle this, the desire to stop Star from crying was strong. Strong enough to make her stand up, carrying the little circlet she'd made, and moved forward to place it on Star's head - ignoring any rain that coated her hand in the process. She lowered her hand and looked up into Star's eyes, trepidation mixing with concern. "I..." She started, but then stopped. She pursed her lips, and then reached out, hand cupping Star's cheek if she allowed it, thumb brushing tears away - uselessly since the rain was doing it anyways but still. "I'm sorry, Star. It was too much." It was too much for her to handle. She knew right now that as soon as they were out of this trance, she'd go back to being overwhelmed. Back to struggling under the mountain of emotions. The regret. Right now it was separate, but she held no expectation of it going away when she was out. So she should say what she felt she needed to say here. "I shouldn't have shared that with you. Or...made you hate me, for what I did."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The rain curiously phased right through Ellesandra's hands. It also wasn't making the ground wet. Just Star. Her own personal torment here. The flower circlet she received touched her, and her face twisted with affection that she didn't feel she deserved to express. But Ellesandra would feel it. This trance was a manifestation of their auras, of their hearts. Ellesandra would feel Star's heart beat thud in their own chest. It was still a bit strange, but it pulsed with love. Every tender moment they shared was bringing Star closer to loving Ellesandra, truly loving them. She leaned into the hand cupping her cheek, eyes closing and raising a hand to hold onto that tender hand against her cheek, scared she would fall apart if they let go. And of course, Ellesandra felt the comfort. The want for so much more. The outpouring of affection, not hate, in her heart. She shook her head at Ellesandra's words. "You have nothing to apologize for," she said quietly. "I'm the one who should be...Is...sorry. I'm the one you should hate. I let you down. When you needed me more than you ever have before I let how much I care about you get to me. Let my heart's burning blind me for how...Mad I am at all those other people around you in the memory. How much my whole body was shaking with adrenaline at feeling how hurt you were..." She paused, her fingers curling lovingly into the hand on her cheek, clinging to it. She choked out a sob. "I'm so sorry, Ellesandra...I'm so sorry I failed you.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There was...confusion. She shook her head, sure she'd heard wrong, but...she felt it. Felt the affection, the regret, rather than the anger, hatred, disappointment. She felt shame in star, but it wasn't that she was ashamed of Ellesandra. "Star?" Her name came out into a question, shaking her head as Star choked out a sob and apologized for failing her? "Star, I...don't understand. Why were you mad at them? It...it was me who messed up in those memories. Sure maybe the King was a bit cruel but it was my fault. And you didn't let me down? Or fail me?" Ellesandra didn't know what to do now, but she did know she wasn't feeling what she'd expected to feel from Star. She wasn't feeling that hatred, that disapproval, that ashamed feeling she'd imagined Sia had. She felt affection, affection that still lived within Ellesandra for Star as well, even if it was...buried beneath a mountain of other emotions right now. She reached out, pulling Star in with her Sobs to hold her, still confused but her 'must protect Star and make her feel better' instincts kicking in. One hand slid around her waist to hold her close, while the other reached up and slowly began combing fingers through her hair. "I'm...confused. Isn't this the calm place? Why are you feeling so sad?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's acceptance of the hug was immediate. She was falling to pieces, and Ellesandra would feel it. There was such immense shame that was inwardly focused, it was drowning her other emotions. The rain cloud continued to rain only on Star, even in the hug. The rain passed through Ellesandra just to land on her, where necessary. Star felt comfort against Ellesandra, but there was a strong feeling that she didn't deserve it that prevented her from cheering up because of it. Ellesandra surely recognized THAT emotion. "They betrayed you," she said with a sniffle. "I...Can't tell you all that I know, because...Y'know...but...Everyone except Sophia, as well as the king and queen and prince I suppose, wasn't being fully honest about what they felt. That's...All I can say that I feel you can accept isn't breaching their emotional consent, things that I feel I could tell just based on what I know of these people from your other memories." She looked at Ellesandra, putting the smallest distance between them to do so. Her face continued to twist in anguish. "I failed you because I was so...Protective of you that I was lashing out at them, for all the hate I felt towards the king, the queen, the prince...I can't tell if I hate the prince or king more...But I've never felt such urges to be violent in my heart before." More shame at that admission. "A-And I was lashing out at them, but...I was taking it out on you, a-and.." She couldn't even finish, or go on to explain the nuances of this calm place and why she was still able to be sad here, because she just started bawling as guilt and shame came crashing onto her shoulders as she stood to face the realties of how she'd hurt the woman she was falling in love with.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra chose to ignore the bit about them betraying her. There was a definite difference in opinion there. Whatever Star saw, Ellesandra didn't really believe that any of this was their fault. Maybe, in some ways, Marigold could be blamed for how she'd thrown Ellesandra away and essentially gave her the choice of disobeying her or leaving. But beyond that? Everything was Ellesandra's choice, her fault still. It was still her fault. Despite the forced calm the thought sent a ping of pain and shame in her, but it floated away like the rest, and she didn't focus on those emotions right now. She was instead focusing on what Star was saying about how she'd apparently failed her? Ellesandra held a little tighter when Star couldn't even finish, fully recognizing that feeling of shame and not deserving comfort. Despite knowing that feeling well, Ellesandra wasn't sure how to make Star feel better through it. She shook her head. "Star..." She pulled Star's head down to her chest, to rest there and hear her heartbeat - if she had one in this state. Her hand continue to comb through Star's hair and she rested her chin on the top of Star's, despite the awkwardness because of height difference. "I...I think I know what you're talking about, in lashing out at that hurting me." The memory of feeling scared of Star. Of feeling like Star hated her. Even just that caused her heart to break a little, the thought of Star throwing her away just like Marigold had. The insecurity of that and how quickly her mind and heart had jumped to that conclusion. "But I'm okay, alright? Just...just give me time. I'll come out of it. I just need to process, I'm not like you with emotions. They overwhelm me easily, that's why I kept them pushed down. And I don't hate you. You didn't fail me, okay? Just...just go get me cocoa or something, then come back and hold me. That's all I need. Just held. Okay?" It was weird telling Star how to take care of her in this world, instead of just being able to take care of herself in the real world. This was all an odd experience, one Ellesandra was far from used to.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It was certainly a reversal of the usual script. Star, needing to hear how she hadn't done wrong. Ellesandra, explaining what they needed instead of Star more or less knowing, and being able to foster that deep sense of emotional security in them. And of course, the most backwards thing, Ellesandra saying something and Star being the one to reject it in her heart. Despite hearing that she hadn't failed Ellesandra, that Ellesandra didn't hate her, her heart still ached in ways Ellesandra would never have felt before. Star had never been this ashamed of herself. Star had doubts, and sorrows, and feelings of inadequacy in the past that Ellesandra would have felt from their resonance. But nothing like this. Ellesandra certainly knew this feeling well, the notion of failure and being worthless. It was not on the same scale of course. Nobody had died. But somehow, this small slip of judgement had been like an icy dagger in Star's heart, one she felt she jammed in there herself with her recklessness. She still wanted the comfort, but still felt she didn't deserve it. She put herself on a place where it had become immensely important to her that she look after Ellesandra's emotional well-being. She would come out of it, eventually. But not until she felt the damage she believed she caused was remedied. Still, there was immense fear and anxieties that she had ruined something between them, which of course, Ellesandra felt fully, even if Star was crying too hard to actually say any of it. And then? A violent crack appeared in the sky above them. More cracks bridged off of those. Seeing the literal sky cracking like it was made of glass was a little unnerving, but it wasn't long-lived. The sky shattered, and everything went dark. Star's physical presence was gone, for a moment, before the trance gave way to physical reality again, slowly easing Ellesandra back into consciousness. Star was there, still, behind Ellesandra, still holding them, still sobbing, still shaking. She was in no state to get some cocoa, but...She was at least listening to what Ellesandra said. She was holding them. Holding them tight. Holding them so tight she'd never dare let go until she had to.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked up in concern and surprise when the world just split open. She'd been trying to process the feelings that she was getting from Star, to make sense of them. Unlike Star, this wasn't easy for her. Trying to understand what Star was feeling and relating it back to the emotion to figure out why and how she began feeling that way wasn't an immediate, empathetic moment for Ellesandra like it was Star. It required focus and thought - and that had been completely broken with the world around them shattering. What this trance did do, though, was it broke Ellesandra out of her disassociative state. Ellesandra gasped as she came back to in her body, her body's natural defense of numbness going as the trance ended and she was all but forced back into that pain, guilt, shame, and fear of Star's hatred. That departed after a moment of trying to reprocess and stabilize herself, feeling Star holding onto her and just...sobbing and shaking. Ellesandra's own pain echoed in Star and back, and she turned around, pulling Star in to hold. She felt cried out still, having cried so much already, but she still held onto Star and closed her eyes...feeling the sorrow, the grief, the guilt and regret for both of them. She fully embraced Star, clenching her teeth against the onslaught of emotions and, well. She was doing what Star had done for her before. She was just feeling Star's pain, feeling her own pain as well, and just...letting it happen. That was all she knew how to do right now. There were no words that would make this better, she couldn't snap her fingers and make either of them feel better. It just...sucked. And while it sucked, she'd hold Star - both to help herself, and help Star.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

What else was there to do? The pair of them were suffering. In pain. And though Star didn't feel she deserved the comfort, she also simply could not reject Ellesandra. She just couldn't. It was not in her heart to ever allow that. So she clung to them all the same, conflicted by the desire to be as close to them as possible while also feeling she deserved to be admonished and yelled at by Ellesandra or told she wasn't worth loving the same way Star was coming to love Ellesandra. A desperate battle against herself in unfamiliar territory, for she had never contended with how love amplified her feelings to such immense degrees for Ellesandra. So all she could do was hold the other woman and...Let things happen. Let it all process, let it all pass, and deal with what remained when the storm passed. She eventually ran out of tears, again, but not for a while. And the sorrow and shame didn't seem to be going anywhere, content to jam ice picks into her heart repeatedly. But even in feeling like she herself didn't deserve this comfort, she still did all she could to comfort Ellesandra. She wanted, needed them to be happy. It was never so simple, but...However small or large it might be, she wasn't going to be able to separate herself from this shame fully until she fully believed Ellesandra was genuinely happy, and that she hadn't ruined everything. Until then, it would be a small scar on her heart, once it stopped actively bleeding as it was in the moment. If Ellesandra didn't change anything, then hours would pass like this. Straight through to sundown, and then a bit beyond, until night overtook the land.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra held tightly to Star the whole time. She cried a little more throughout this, though never the full on sobs she'd had when just coming out of the memories. She got better, over time. The feelings passed through her, then out. There was still grief. Shame. She still hated herself - those shadows were still there. She still felt like it was all her fault. But there was only so much crying you could do, so much wallowing that Ellesandra could handle before it just became numb again. Not disassociative numb, but just...an okay, this is a thing and I've got to just live with it. The thing that didn't just get better was the pain she could feel in Star. How Star was suddenly the one hating herself - well, maybe not so much that, but what she'd done and the massive regret there. Ellesandra no longer held it against her, understanding why Star had lashed out even if she didn't agree with the reasoning. Understanding that it had been protective and anger at those who had hurt Ellesandra, even if she was certain Star was just blind to Ellesandra's own inadequacies. She ran fingers through Star's hair and then kissed the top of her head once she was no longer in the state where doing so was hard for her. Ellesandra still fully believed that Star deserved better for her, that she herself was unlovable and not a good partner to anyone, but she didn't seem to have any issue right now with showing the affection and care she had for Star. It could be one way, even if she didn't think it could be truly mutual. "It's okay, Star." She whispered. Her heart ached both for her own traumas, and Star's pain right now. "I'm fine." That was...a huge lie, but for the specific reasons that Star was upset at herself? Yes, she was fine.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was feeling waves of inadequacy and undeserving pangs of pain with each kiss that landed on her, despite also feeling fluttering in her heart at being kissed by Ellesandra. She wanted it. So badly. But was torturing herself continually over what she'd done, to the point of unhealthy self-blame and agony. It might prove impressive, if it wasn't so sad, how powerfully Star was able to hold this against herself. So much that hearing Ellesandra say it was okay had a vigorous shake of her head. And through it all, Ellesandra was left to just feel what Star felt. And under those layers of pain and self-shaming and inward admonishment was the most powerful emotion of them all: Love. All this emotional time together was doing was transforming those flames of affection into something permanent, something that was now, inexorably, part of Star. She might not be able to put a name to it, it was still unfamiliar to her...But Ellesandra knew it, or at least something like it. What they felt for Marigold, while nuanced in a million ways that made it different to what Star felt now, the core was there. Star had opened her heart to Ellesandra and, with time and this final push in the way of Ellesandra sharing this, their most important series of memories, had draw Star close enough that a bright pink flare burned across her entire aura, enough to make it briefly visible to Ellesandra. Strangely, that love passed onto Ellesandra to feel, but also brought with it a depth of power that would be unlike anything Ellesandra had ever felt before. The timing might be a bit strange, as Star was still more or less unaware of what was happening, and this wasn't really a time that Ellesandra needed to be empowered, but Ellesandra might recall some insights from the journal they had read. Star was out of control, and her emotions were as raw as they could be. And in that, there was power. Power enough that Ellesandra would feel that invincible feeling surge into them again. Not emotionally invincible of course, but if they harnessed this mana to cast into their haste, they could outrun arrows, maybe even run across water. Or so it felt like, anyway. Auramancy was a strange and mysterious gift to possess, indeed. But none of that did much to help Star feel better. All it did was smack Ellesandra in the face with a burst of genuine love that was too powerful to ignore or deny that Star truly felt it. And then right on the heels of that? The surge of how much Star still hated herself. Because Ellesandra clearly needed more reasons to hate how complicated all this emotional business was.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra held Star, but as the power, the feeling of love became noticeable? Ellesandra....froze. She didn't know what to do, but her body and her mind just - couldn't process it. She FELT it, felt it through their resonance and connection, but even feeling it it just...didn't process. Didn't make sense. It was directly warring with the idea and feeling she had in her own self about not being lovable. About being worthless. The dissonance between how she felt about herself and how Star felt about her was...harsh. Two very opposing ends of the spectrum. She felt the power, but obviously there wasn't anything she was using it for right now. She didn't even consider the power right now, as there were obviously other things that she could focus on. Such as taking the idea of Star's love for her, ignoring it and pushing it to the side, to focus on that self hate. Not her own - oh no, she'd be a hypocrite about this anyday - but Star's. And as it just....continued, Ellesandra decided this whole holding and processing shit wasn't working. They were going to do things her way now, differently. Well, not entirely her way, since her way was to pretend the emotion didn't exist and there was no situation in which Ellesandra expected Star to be able to do that, but still a different way than Star expressed it. Ellesandra took a deep breath in to prepare herself....and then she pulled away from Star, forcefully if Star tried to cling on. Just enough so that she could stand up, and then she reached down and hauled Star up onto her feet, fully supporting her weight - mostly on her left arm - until Star would get her feet underneath her. "Star, I need you to focus on me right now. Look me in the eyes, and listen to what I'm saying. You're going to follow orders. You're going to look me in the eyes, nod your head that you understand. And once you do that, you're going to get down, and give me ten pushups." Yes. Ellesandra was going to force Star to exercise. Give her something else to focus her mind on. Give her a way to work that self hate out of her body, rather than just letting it stew there. It worked for Ellesandra, when she'd had constant sparring bouts in the training yard or training sessions with Sia. She'd constantly worked out her frustration at having her feelings unreciprocated, at the politics of Marigold's life, at how the Prince didn't treat Marigold like Ellesandra thought he should. This type of physical activity helped Ellesandra a lot then, and while she didn't exactly get an excuse to do it much anymore, she was confident giving Star something to focus on, a way to burn energy would at least help get her out of the self hate spiral. It wouldn't stop it necessarily, or cause her not to feel it anymore, but it wouldn't spiral and get worse, right?
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There were a lot of ways that Star expected things to progress, but Ellesandra running away from her and then lifting her and then...Asking for pushups? The question marks were all but visible floating up over her head. Ellesandra was asking for pushups. Pushups. Well. It certainly took her mind off her spiral, because now she was just confused. But one of the absolute wonderful things about Star's auramancy was that it let her see the emotions attached to this request. The desire from Ellesandra to help her. That was all that kept Star from audibly questioning what the hell Ellesandra was thinking. She was...Not going to drop and give Ellesandra ten pushups. That was the last thing on her mind. What she did instead, she moved to Ellesandra and laid a hand on their shoulder, then leaned in to kiss their cheek before stepping back and shaking her head. "Ellesandra I...That...Won't help me. I'm sorry."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the confusion, but then the refusal. Even with a hand on her shoulder, and the kiss on her cheek, she shook her head and pointed to the ground. Her eyes focused on Star's arms pointedly. "Have you tried?" The comment was not said maliciously, or making fun of Star's strength. Hell, Ellesandra herself wasn't exactly a strength fighter, being more of a dextrous, skill focused fighter. Especially since her right harm had been injured - she'd given up a lot of her strength training after that - but it was still something she'd enjoyed for burning steam. Ellesandra continued though, not letting Star comment on her lack of arm strength. "I'm not saying this without cause, Star. When you're upset, your body physically holds that. There's many ways to work that out, but considering I don't think you want a quick fuck to get rid of that-" Well, she might 'want' it but Ellesandra wasn't prepared to give her the appropriate type of lovemaking that she deserved and actually wanted. "And you aren't skilled enough with a blade to actually spar, nor do we have a blade, I'm relying on more manual exercise. Just laying there and holding eachother wasn't working, Star. You weren't getting any better, at all." And that was the crux of it. Ellesandra felt helpless with this emotional source of pain in Star. She didn't know how to help with the way that Star usually helped her; so she was trying to help Star in a way that she knew how to help herself. And how Sia had helped her, even if Ellesandra hadn't been aware Sia was doing it to help her work through frustrations. "You don't have to, but if you haven't tried working frustration and self hatred out this way before, I'd recommend giving it a shot. I've got plenty of experience with that particular emotion."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently shook her head, honestly admitting she hadn't tried it. It was true she didn't know for SURE it wouldn't help, but she sure didn't believe it would. Then, the 'quick fuck' comment had her blushing and looking to the side. Part of her was desperate enough to accept a hate-fuck as penance or...something. She slapped her hands to her cheeks and shook her head to get THAT weird thought out of her head. Momentary horny was achieved, and the close proximity of the two ensured Ellesandra felt it, too. She then closed her eyes a moment and took a deep breath, then opened them to look at Ellesandra. "...It was helping, Ellesandra. It takes time. And...Well, this feeling I have right now that you're talking about, this self hatred, has a lot more to do with you than it does me. N-N-Not that it's YOUR fault or responsibility, obviously...Just...I want so badly to help you," she said, moving one hand to grasp at her opposing elbow. "I expect better of myself than...What happened. It's just...Hard to forgive myself, like...You forgave me too easily, or something. I'm contending with a lot of...New emotions with you, specifically, and it is just hard to...To..." she paused a moment, furrowing her brow. "It's hard to make sense of it all lately, and I just want to rewind the clock so I could have just held you and kissed your forehead and told you nice things instead of just...Blowing up with all that nonsense. You deserve so much better than that, Ellesandra. I know even saying that that you're going to reject the idea of what I'm saying but I...I really feel that way. I really feel...Feel..." Oh. Oh what did she feel? This was new....
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the attraction, the arousal, but it was brushed off. It stirred some of her own arousal, interest in doing that with Star, but she was quite certain she wasn't the right partner for Star. That Star deserved more than that for her first time, that even if she felt the arousal it was easily ignored. What wasn't ignored, however, was Star telling her that her own self hatred was Ellesandra's fault. Oh, that was not what Star said, or even what she meant - and in fact, she followed up immediately to reinforce it wasn't her fault - but the immediate response would be obvious with auramancy. Ellesandra kept her face stoic, but that was useless when their proximity ensured that Star would feel that it had been a punch in the gut for Ellesandra - more than that. Her heart dropped into her stomach and then the punch happened. She clenched her jaw, working to hold back that emotion. Especially with Star immediately clarifying, she was trying her damndest to stop Star from feeling how much the comment had hurt. How much she still blamed herself for even sharing those memories with Star, starting all of this. For having caused all of this by not only her inability to process it, but also causing the situation to begin with years ago. This was exactly why she wasn't the right partner for Star, why she wasn't loveable. "It's not your responsibility to help me, Star." The words came out harshly, but the harshness was directed at herself, not at Star. She wasn't upset at Star, she was upset at herself. She took a step back, pulling her arm away from Star's touch if she was still holding onto her elbow. "This is why you shouldn't let yourself have feelings for me. I'm not a partner, Star. I'm just a guard. That's all I can be." Her words came from the shadow that had been living in her. The self-doubt, the lack of self confidence. The defeated side of her card, which if she took it out to look at it right now had probably just took up a good portion more than it had before in the span of this conversation alone. Star hadn't meant to do it, but she'd just reinforced every one of those bad thoughts Ellesandra had about herself, no matter how strong her affection or love was. "You deserve a partner who isn't already broken."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

She wasn't able to focus on this new feeling in her heart when she felt that gut punch go through. She snapped her eyes to Ellesandra and knit her brow. "No!" she barked, not loud, not aggressive, but a knee-jerk reaction to her hard she was trying to take her own foot out of her mouth. She had been holding onto her own arm, not Ellesandra's, so there was no touch to stay away from. She sighed, frustrated. "Gods, Ellesandra...I know what you're thinking, and no. No, no, no, no, no. You didn't cause me to feel this way, I did. With my own stupidity. Which I'm just making worse now because I am all...Frazzled. But if you need to hear the absolute honesty about it, right now I feel like I need you to punch me in the face to make it better. I don't actually think that will fix anything, but it's just that...Ghhh....Stupid, self-torturous emotion that I keep telling you to not indulge." She paused. "...Please don't actually punch me. I'm squishy," she said, pouting a little. She didn't think Ellesandra would, but she was just...streaming her thoughts. "Listen. I'll...Be okay again. I know what these feelings are. I know how to let them out. I just...Need to feel like crap about it for a little, okay? Because I...Do not feel what I did was at all okay. It was borne of anger and...Malice...And it wasn't even directed at the people who I actually want to yell at, because they're not here. And that's...Not okay. I was trying to be supportive, but I should have known how sensitive you would be to me yelling in that moment. That's why I feel like I failed you, and why I just...Need to hate myself, just for a little while, so I can be better. It's...The same thing I went through when you told me how uncomfortable it made you when I shared someone else's emotions. I went through the same thing. It's...How I make myself better. And I will be better. Always, no matter what, I will be better for you. Because I don't give a damn what either of us think I deserve because even putting aside the fact that I think so highly of you and feel you qualify above and beyond everyone else, that doesn't matter because I WANT you." Her lip trembled, but she had no shame or reservation admitting these things. "You. Nobody else...Just you. And it's too late for me to not have feelings for you, Ellesandra. There's no stopping emotions like these once they start. If anything, this feeling in my heart is just getting stronger ever second I look at you! And no, that's not an invitation to be cheeky and run away to be out of sight or something, either!"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head, even when Star said no and that's not what she meant. Then Star took her by surprise by saying she wanted to be punched in the face. Out of everything Star could have said, THAT was enough to knock Ellesandra out of her emotional spiral for a second to look at her with a 'what the fuck' look on her face. Coming from Ellesandra, that might have been expected. Coming from Star? Very much not so. Her mouth opened partially, about to refuse the request, when Star continued and made the meek little request to not actually get punched. Ellesandra's heart felt swollen for her. Her affection and...love, almost...swelled for Star. The immediate 'must protect' instinct kicked in and she wanted to wrap Star in her arms again, to tell her she wouldn't let anyone punch her in the face, but she didn't. Touching again, after all that was going on and the bad feelings, didn't feel right. She did listen to the rest of what Star said, though. How Star was trying to be supportive, but made a mistake in the process. And how it felt like when Ellesandra called her out on sharing other people's emotions with her. She pursed her lips, not sure how to handle this or how to respond. Really, she hated this emotional shit. It wasn't straightforward and simple, and that's what she needed. But then, Star continued to e say that she wanted Ellesandra. The confession of the emotions, the disregarding of whether or not she deserved Ellesandra or someone better. Her heart pounded. The feelings for Star, having been caged this whole time still, swelled more. And stronger. Brighter. The shadows that had been surrounding them, pushing them down, trying to snuff out their flame - the dark beliefs about herself, the self worth issues, the guilt - seemed to disappear in response to the stronger, brighter flame. Oh, they weren't gone - they would probably never be totally gone, and right now they just couldn't be seen because of how strongly she felt in response to Star's words. They were still there, but unlike how her emotions for Star had been hidden, repressed and ignored, now they were the ones in the cage while the flame swelled in Ellesandra's chest. It felt like her heart was beating a million times a minute. Her stomach churned with nerves and anxiety, but Ellesandra's face softened. She stared at Star for a few moments, and then stepped forward, back into her space. She reached up, cupping both of Star's cheeks in her hands, and moved onto her tippie toes just enough to place her forehead against Stars. Their noses brushed, and she looked Star in the eyes, seriously. No tears, though the obvious swelling and redness of both of their eyes spoke to the hours they'd spent crying. "Star." She whispered, feeling like anything more than a whisper would break the moment, break the spell she herself seemed to be under - whether star was under it as well she was unsure. Her thumbs stroked Star's cheeks gently. "This might be a bad idea, I don't know. But...may I kiss you?" A gentle, affectionate request. Not with the intent to shove Star against the door and fuck her after the kiss, not with the lustful desire they'd felt for eachother all night - though that wasn't gone. This was a request for a kiss that didn't necessarily lead to those things. A first, true kiss, for both of them - because Ellesandra was as inexperienced with this type of affection as Star was.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Now it was Star's turn to have the unexpected happen. She'd gotten so used to her emotional openness being rejected, so used to Ellesandra rebuffing her at every turn, so used to her desires being, for one reason or another, not permissible. Words like 'couldn't' and 'shouldn't' were all she expected. Not that that had ever stopped her, obviously. But there was some part of her that had to accept that what she wanted wasn't going to be hers. And that part of her, the part that had been a source of pain for her, was swiftly punted clear into the horizon the moment Ellesandra asked that question, with the hopeful, optimistic, brighter, truer self within Star being the one doing the triumphant kick of those cynical feelings clear out of her heart while smugly grinning and planting a flag over Star's heart that declared themselves the winner. She had never given up hope, and this moment validated those feelings a thousand times over. The moment Ellesandra cupped her cheeks and pressed their foreheads together, Star's eyes went a little wider. Her cheeks heated up. Her heart started to pound. Ellesandra would feel the effect it had. A potent rush of acceptance and desire, her whole body crying out for this, screaming 'yes, yes, yes, more!'. Tingles rushed from the tip top of her head down across her entire figure to her toes. Suddenly she couldn't feel her legs. This was...Real. This wasn't a dream. This wasn't a fantasy. She'd had plenty of those so far. And because it was real, Star's confidence went from one-hundred to zero instantly. Her face grew hotter. A hot breath pushed through her now slightly parted lips as her eyes fixed on the ones in front of her. All she had to do was just...Accept. And she would. She wouldn't dare let this moment get away from her. Even though her whole body was now suddenly on fire and doing anything other than sputter out some failed attempt at language sounded really hard to do right now, she knew she had to say it, without any ambiguity. Make sure Ellesandra knew how unequivocally, how immense, how impossibly much she wanted what Ellesandra was about to give her. And in that moment, there was only one thing she could think to say to make sure Ellesandra knew how important it was that they kiss her right now: "M-Make...Make sure.." she began, her voice tiny, barely whispering. She slowly wrapped her arms around Ellesandra, gingerly pulling their bodies flush against one another. Submissive and longing, spoken from the depths of her heart, she gave her answer: "Make sure it's a kiss I'll never forget, Ellesandra.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra's nerves were skyrocketing as she waited for an answer. She felt Star's cheeks heat beneath her hands and it tugged at the more confident Ellesandra, who would be able to play on that and flirt and make Star swoon. That Ellesandra didn't come out though; as much as Ellesandra could switch into that role, it wasn't what this situation actually demanded. Because she didn't, though, Ellesandra was more nervous than she'd ever been. This type of intimacy, the closeness and gentleness of their affection, was entirely new. Her thumbs stroked Star's cheeks again, trying to hide that they were shaking a little. She took in a deep breath as she felt the excitement and the longing in Star as well. Her eyes closed, taking a few moments to center herself. There was a lot of pressure in that request that she wasn't sure Star had realized. This would be Star's first kiss, and Ellesandra was to make it memorable. Without making it lustful, because as much as she wanted to do that it STILL wasn't right. Another deep breath, that breath being felt by Star across her own lips, before her fingers lowered just a bit to slide around the back of her neck and then pull Star's lips in. They touched, a brush at first, lips running across eachother's, and then pressing a little more firmly. Slow and letting Star have time to pull back if she ever decided she needed or wanted to, but assuming this didn't happen she'd take Star's lower lip in her own, her tongue coming out to taste it as she pulled at it. Slowly bringing Star into a deeper kiss, rather than going right in. Letting Star experience the softness of their lips brushing before she pressed in to deepen the kiss, which she did just after. The thing is, Ellesandra was a talented kisser. She had plenty of practice with it, she knew how to do it, and that experience was the only reason she got through this without her nerves pulling her back again. The touch of their lips surely showed Star how nervous she was simply through her auramancy - there was no hiding emotions from Star - but it also showed how much she'd wanted this. How her heart, despite still having those shadows surrounding it, sang and grew at the touch of their lips. How the world seemed to fade away around Ellesandra and focus only on Star's lips, her face in her hands, their bodies pressed together. Whether this was a memorable kiss for Star, Ellesandra couldn't confirm - it depended on if Star felt the spark and the attraction and direct affection in return. But for Ellesandra? This would be a kiss that her world seemed centered around. That she never wanted to end. That until she felt like it needed to, if one or both of them needed to part for breath, she would continue it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was little Ellesandra could actually do to spoil this kiss. Little that Ellesandra needed to do to actually make it something Star would never forget. Much as it was something that romantic core of Star wanted, her inexperience didn't prepare her for how this would actually feel, and how as long as it was loving, Star truly would never forget it. And oh...Was it ever loving. The first brush of their lips had Star's own lips trembling. Anticipation, nervousness, and excitement all exploded from her pounding heart as the final moments of her being kissless were upon her. And then their lips met. And something so very special happened, then. Star's aura bloomed, beautiful pinks and rose hues were visible if Ellesandra's eyes were open. But even if not? The overwhelming love, affection, desire, and immense strength of emotion could easily be felt. Every part of Ellesandra that might be nervous, every part of them that might ask 'does she want this?' or 'am I doing this right?' was met with overwhelming response that begged, demanded that Ellesandra not stop. Star's chest fluttered with butterflies, and that was mirrored unto Ellesandra to feel, so that Star's butterflies could flutter around with Ellesandra's own. Separate, but unified. Physically, Star followed Ellesandra's lead. The inexperience was there, of course, but Ellesandra's experience was a useful guide for her. The tongue was a surprise, but not an unpleasant one. Just a surprise that had her loose a whimpering moan, quiet and breathy, as her maw opened to receive Ellesandra's hot muscle. Star's lips were plush and soft, like strips of warm gossamer. Her tongue brought an equal, affectionate heat to mingle with Ellesandra's. Her scent was the same breezy, airy, light and floral one that was so delicately feminine as the woman herself. Her fingers curled into Ellesandra's top behind them, not balling into fists but clinging with a gentle, tender need. Nothing else mattered. This was everything Star wanted out of her first kiss; the tenderness, the affection, the depth of adoration between them. There was no simple spark of attraction or affection in return - it was, rather, a conflagration, a blaze that had long ago eclipsed sparks and sent tongues of flame through every vein in her body and soul. Everything that Star was, every fiber of her being, embraced Ellesandra and begged them to never stop. The joy, the happiness in Star, was equally overwhelming, and it didn't matter that she had cried so much today already. Tears once again welled in her eyes, and a single tear slid out of each eye to trail down to fall upon the hands that cupped her cheeks. Without auramancy, there might be a worry that this was somehow a bad thing, but there'd be no doubts for Ellesandra. Happiness. These were tears of joy. And it didn't matter if they kissed all night long, Star wasn't going to dare break it. The more likely danger? Her legs were trembling, weak, and numb. Them giving out from underneath her was a real danger.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

So not only was kissing gently and affectionately like this new for Ellesandra, but so was kissing an auramancer overall. Feeling everything that was coming from Star was almost distracting, if she hadn't been so focused on the kiss and enjoying it herself. And with the touch, the closeness, Star would feel the immediate response from Ellesandra when she groaned into the kiss. The spike of arousal, the joy that came with having made Star made that noise. Knowing and - FEELING - that Star was enjoying this, that it was making her happy, sent Ellesandra to new levels of satisfaction and her own enjoyment she'd never even considered. Her heart pounded in beat with Stars it felt like, and her mouth moved against Stars with a forced slowness against the more frantic, needy pace that was building more and more in Ellesandra. It would be easy to give over to the need, but she wasn't prepared for that yet - not in this first kiss. Her left hand dropped from behind Star's neck to her lower back, pulling her tight, while her right maintaining there and helping guide Star into the kiss, taking it slow and being careful to avoid things like knocking teeth together. She guided Star into the kiss, teasing her tongue with her own, working to show Star how to do this as well as ensuring she enjoyed it. There was no denying that her heart continued to sing at the kiss, that Ellesandra, while nervous, wanted this beyond anything. The shadows, the dark thoughts and self-doubts, were there, in the back of her mind, but they were overshadowed by the flame of desire and affection and...love, even if Ellesandra might not be ready to admit that, Star could feel it. As she felt Star's legs trembling, as if they might give out soon, she finally broke that kiss, but only briefly. Her left hand slipped beneath Star's bum, an intentional pass without squeezing but still a touch over her rear that sent arousal and more need through Ellesandra, to then heft Star up. Her right hand moved down to her upper back to stabilize her while Ellesandra took a few steps, then lowered them both onto the bed gently. She lowered herself on top of Star, but didn't go further yet. She wanted to go right back into kissing, but she knew she needed to check in. So she pressed her elbows into either side of Star, careful not to put too much weight on her, and kept her forehead pressed to Stars, eyes opening finally to look at her. "You okay?" She asked, as if that was necessary. In reality, she could tell by Star's aura, her feelings, that she wanted and needed this just as much as Ellesandra, but Ellesandra needed to her hear say it. To confirm and verbalize both consent and desire for Ellesandra to continue kissing her. That she wasn't having second thoughts right now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The noises were things Star had heard other people make before, in overhearing them when others didn't know she was within earshot, or that walls were thin enough to let the sound travel past them. And in those moments in the past, Star had felt a little nervous, a little anxious, maybe a little aroused. But hearing Ellesandra make that sound? Her thighs pressed together and her legs quaked. Gods above that turned her on. Despite that very valid distraction, she focused on the kiss. And this was where Ellesandra might get an answer to some idle thoughts they'd had in the past - there was an immediate and constant feedback while kissing, while touching like this. What felt good, what was neutral, what wasn't liked. It was all felt as soon as the touch was made. Of course, Ellesandra was keeping things tender and sweet and loving, and that meant there wasn't any negatives to be felt. But there were small motions Star liked most that Ellesandra would be able to know as soon as they did them. The perfect way to brush their tongues together. The perfect degree to which Star liked them suckling on her lip. How she adored being pulled close. How the touch across her pert rear gave a little flicker of excitement and nervousness, as she was so unused to intimate touching. This of course went both ways, so...Despite Star's inexperience, she adapted quickly. She was so familiar with acting on these feelings, this guiding compass that was someone else's aura, that it would be hard to pin her as a kissless virgin after just a short time kissing. She was intelligent, and attentive. She felt what Ellesandra did, mirrored some of those things back on the knight, felt what felt good and what didn't, and did more of what felt best, whether that was giving a little more push with her tongue, sucking on their tongue, sliding her tongue along their lips, suckling on their top or bottom lip, or even being a little coy and teasing Ellesandra's kisses forward to beckon them to take more of her. Being guided by her affections and love for Ellesandra, she was able to embrace what the knight enjoyed rather than think about whatever preconceptions she might have about kissing or what she was 'supposed' to do. Her focus was solely, and singularly, on Ellesandra. Nothing else, nobody else, even existed to her now. Being lifted up brought another spark of excitement as the more adult desires in her screamed 'yes please' all at once. A little gasp, and another rush of heat to her cheeks. She clung to them as those few steps were crossed and she was slowly lowered onto the bed. Then, Ellesandra got on top of her. They weren't straddling her, but boy oh boy did she still get a big dose of realization as to why Ellesandra liked it so much when Star got on top of her. Oh. Oh that's why they liked it. Star was nervously trembling below the woman above her. Her aura was flickering in and out of visibility for Ellesandra. The resonant connection between them was pulsing in time with their heartbeats, and it passed on exactly what Ellesandra needed to know. Her first thoughts were 'gods you're so beautiful', and the only second thoughts she was having was 'make love to me you gorgeous goddess of a woman'. Which was also her third, fourth, fifth, and just about every thought she was having in that moment. But despite how loudly her aura was screaming at Ellesandra to kiss every inch of her body, Star recognized and respected their need to hear it, in no uncertain terms. So she nodded against their forehead, her eyes locked onto theirs while arms looped around their neck. Her lips were slightly parted, loosing every hot breath from the chest that caged her pounding heart out for Ellesandra to feel tickling their chin and neck. "M-Mmnh...I've never been more okay, never felt more alive than I do right now, Ellesandra...I-I..." Gulp. This was hard to say, even for someone as open as Star: "I want...More...I-I want...You..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

God, auramancy was HOT. Being able to actively feel what Star liked as she did it? How aroused she was, how much she was enjoying herself? It was a feedback loop, since every time she felt something Star liked, Ellesandra's own enjoyment of it increased as well. She was a giver in bed - not that she disliked anyone giving her pleasure, but her main form of satisfaction came from giving pleasure herself. There was no hiding this with every small sound and feeling of joy she got from Star. When Star said she wanted more, wanted her? And Ellesandra could FEEL this want? It took every ounce of her strength to not just rip at Star's clothes. No, this still needed to be slow and tender, even if she wanted more than slow and tender. Was first kiss into immediate sex too fast for Star? The thought crossed her mind, but Star was literally asking for it right now, and she could feel the need in Star. With any other person Ellesandra would have confirmed again, checking in and ensuring this wasn't too fast, but she could feel that it wasn't. And so, with Star's arms looped around her neck, she leaned down and kissed Star again. This time the kiss wasn't as slow. She picked up right where they had left off, continuing it as if it hadn't been broken. There was more need in it now, too. A bit more of a feral desire when she nipped at Star's lip, then immediately followed it up with her tongue running across it to soothe any minor soreness from the nip. She was gentle and didn't go for any actual pain, but the sensation change of a bite versus tongue worked for a lot of people. And even best, she could immediately tell what did and didn't work, so she'd know to avoid that in the future. She'd shifted her legs so that she pushed Star's legs to the side, and was resting on her knees, leaning forward over Star, between Star's legs. Almost as if Star was straddling her from below. It gave her a perfect place to lay her hips down, not to grind...yet... but to give the promise of sensation, the pressure of her just being there. It also freed up one of her hands, resting her torso weight on her left elbow, her right hand moved down and, over clothes, began running against Star's side. Aimlessly, just a need to touch. She was keeping her hand over Star's clothes for now, not wanting to go too fast or cause too much sensation at once, but the pressure of her fingers over her side, stomach, tracing up to her shoulder and elbow and squeezing. She was finding the places over clothes that Star enjoyed being touched, without going straight for her breasts or anything like that. Breasts, ass, and vagina were not the only erogenous zones on most people, and Ellesandra was going to take full advantage of this auramancy to find all of Star's.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Finding the good and the bad was so much easier with their auras speaking to one another, indeed. So it would be that when Ellesandra nipped at her lip and then smoothed their tongue over the nip, the jolt from Star was felt, and the anxiousness at it. It wasn't stepping over any lines of course, it was gentle, but it induced more anxiety in Star than it did arousal. She wasn't ready for nipping just yet; Ellesandra had been very much reading the signs correctly in knowing how bad an idea it would have been to have their first time be a rough, emotionless fuck. How right it was for tenderness to be the focus. How much emotional and physical reassurance Star needed in this moment. Perhaps Star would be more receptive to the nips and more feral aspects of lovemaking in time, and after talking things out, but there was only so much her auramancy could bridge the gap of inexperience on this front. Still, it was all a tiny blip amidst the overwhelmingly beautiful sensations that burned in her. The kiss overall more than made up for it, as did Ellesandra's wandering hand. Star naturally would prove to be very sensitive when it came time to touching the typical erogenous zones, but Ellesandra's exploration would find those other ones that Star liked. Her sides were receptive to touch, trembles just below the skin following the trail of Ellesandra's fingers. Trailing along her side to her shoulder got a small shudder, though Ellesandra would be able to tell from the feedback how Star liked the touch on her sides below her ribs more. Shoulder and arm wasn't nearly as sensitive, though there was a loving response when her elbow was squeezed. The tenderness of the act was clearly felt, even if it wasn't physically arousing. And both of those things were important; Star clearly needed those tender, reassuring squeezes and touches as much as she craved the more exciting and fiery, exploring touches. And while Ellesandra was doing that, while the two continued to kiss and set one another's hearts aflame, Star did what felt natural while Ellesandra pushed up between her legs: She rose her legs up, then wrapped them around Ellesandra's hips and locked her feet together over the small of their back, tugging their figures closer together in a beautiful knot. Even without auramancy, that was a fairly obvious signal of how much Star was inviting all that was happening. Star moved a hand onto Ellesandra's back, still clinging to their neck with the other, and then there was a moment of...Hesitation as that hand was about to dive under the collar of Ellesandra's top and explore their bare back. She didn't do this, and the worry that that was not okay was felt, as that hand instead shifted to keep on top of their clothes and slide over the part of their back she could reach in tender, loving rubs.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra noted the response to the nip. God, this auramancy was convenient. She avoided doing it again, keeping the kiss focused on tender, loving type kisses rather than trying to increase Star's heat and desire like she had with the nip. It was also nice being able to feel that star liked the touches on her sides, around or below her ribs. Ellesandra really could get used to this. It also begged the question - how would it feel to feel Star have an orgasm this way? The thought brought a rush of excitement and arousal shooting through Ellesandra, the need to feel that tonight going up. She didn't know if Star was up for it, but if she was, it was going to happen. As her hand was coming back down from Star's shoulder, she felt Star's hand hesitate on her back. Hesitate to dip beneath. If auramancy wasn't there, if she couldn't feel Star's hesitancy and concern for Ellesandra in regards to the touch, she would have assumed Star didn't want to, or was afraid or ashamed of Ellesandra's scars. But no - Star was trying to be respectful for the fact that Ellesandra had said no to that just earlier this evening. Ellesandra pulled away from the kiss just long enough to look Star in the eyes, her breath heavy on Star's lips. Her pupils were dilated with desire, but...she needed to respond to Star's hesitance. "No healing, and you can touch me wherever you want." Not that Ellesandra WANTED Star to touch her scars, to give them any particular attention. They would bring back reminders of what happened and that would really, really dampen the mood. But if Star just wanted to touch her back, skin to skin? Just touch her, and not run fingers along her scars and such? That was fine, and Star would be able to feel the discomfort if she decided to specifically trace any of Ellesandra's scars. While the knife hadn't left a scar, but the whips most definitely had - along with a nasty ripped looked scar on her shoulder where the sword had stabbed straight through, and a wicked looking one down the top of her right arm where the greatsword had slashed through during Ellesandra's reckless movements. She didn't wait for an answer, dipping her head and pressing her lips to the corner of Star's mouth this time. Not kissing her like before, but a gentle kiss to the side of her lips, just barely touching. Then over, gentle consistent kisses along Star's red cheeks, up along her jaw line just on the edge of her jaw against her neck to get an idea of how Star felt with neck kisses, but then up to her ear. She kissed her earlobe instead of nipping, based on how Star had responded to the previous nip, and then whispered. "Anywhere, Star." The words came out low and sultry. Obviously implying more than just her back. To put that thought in Star's head, while beginning to kiss back down her jaw line, planning to either begin kissing at her neck if Star had seemed to enjoy that, or just go back to her lips for more returned kissing if not.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The moment the kiss broke, Star had a momentary confusion, but hearing that it was just Ellesandra wanting to clear the air, set that boundary, Star gave a soft nod. She wasn't particularly in the mindset to go pausing what they were doing to take a healing break. Would she even be able to concentrate properly on healing someone with all this hazy fog in her brain? Hard to say. Probably not. Suffice to say, she wasn't even thinking about that, but it was good to hear Ellesandra be clear. But with that permission, she dipped her hand under Ellesandra's collar and smoothed her hand along their back, which did touch their scars along the way but there was no focus on them, and a subtle avoidance of them just to try and be respectful and not force Ellesandra to feel the touch on them, as she assumed (and would feel to confirm as she initially drew her hand down their back) they didn't want to be touched there. Not that they would hopefully mind terribly them being touched just in the act of Star rubbing their back, but the beauty of auramancy in the moment was that the feedback was instant, and Star knew without being told what Ellesandra didn't want touched. She just followed her instincts otherwise, and focused mostly on trailing ever-so-gentle fingertips along the length of Ellesandra's spine, seeing if that got any reaction before wandering over other parts of their back she could reach. And while she was doing this, Ellesandra would feel positive reception to the little peppered kisses along Star's lip and down their cheek to their jaw, then would discover that yes, oh very much yes, Star liked neck kisses. If Ellesandra was looking to light a fire in Star, or rather, add to the already giant flame inside her, the neck was a good vector. Very sensitive indeed, and had her gasping from the sensation, followed by some heavy breaths through her open lips. She squeezed Ellesandra more tightly against her. Then, again, when the kiss onto her earlobe came. Not as sensitive as the neck, but attention to her ear was turning her on as well. But it was the whisper into her ear was what really got her. She bit her lower lip, eyes closing tight, as Ellesandra invited her to touch 'anywhere'. Her legs squeezed Ellesandra's hips, and a rush of arousal shot through her. Ellesandra's disposition as being one to enjoy pleasing another would leave them with a venerable feast of those affirming and gratifying feelings as each experienced attack on Star's body elicited the sweet nectar of validation in how good it felt for the virgin below them. Star tilted her head to expose her neck more for Ellesandra, inviting them as they returned to kiss her more there, and so began the soft noises. Small, but high-pitched moans. Weak and submissive, they came alongside shudders that rocked through Star's body for Ellesandra to feel physically, as well as through their connection. Every touch in the right place, every kiss, was sending back waves of 'yes' and 'more' to the knight, feeding their excitement and fanning the flames of their affections brighter and brighter with every touch, every kiss, and every beat of their pounding hearts.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took in a deep breath when she felt Star run a hand down her back. When she felt the touch to her scars, there was a shiver. It wasn't pleasant, but with Star just making it a brush across and not focusing on them, it was fine. And her touch on the rest of Ellesandra's back? She liked it. Her hand running down her spine made her want to arch into it, though she didn't because she was focused on what she was doing otherwise. The way that Star responded to the kisses, the arousal spiking, the need - they all fed strongly into Ellesandra's own desire. It was enough that she groaned into Star's skin as she kissed, closing her eyes and holding herself against Star for a moment. There was no hiding how much Ellesandra enjoyed feeling Star's pleasure and arousal. How much that turned her on too. She continued pressing her lips around on Star's neck, and then opened her mouth for more open mouth kisses. No sucking, no biting, but more intimate, intentionally trying to make the kisses pleasurable since Star seemed to enjoy this area so much. She lowered her mouth to over where she could feel Star's pulse, her tongue coming out and licking across it while she kissed. And then down, along her neck and to her collarbone, kissing along it and then moving back up to her neck. Ellesandra had found an erogenous spot to focus on for now, and her hand had moved back down to her waist, fingers sliding just beneath clothing to just...grip. She held onto her waist, palm brushing over her skin and fingers digging in just enough to have a good grip, but careful not to squeeze so much that she would be causing any pain or bruising, and pulling her against Ellesandra even harder. There was no hiding her own arousal, and the desire to do more than just hold herself against Star's heat. The desire to grind, feeling Star's legs wrapped around her waist. The desire to speed this up, get right to the meat of the matter and push Star to seeing Stars. Yet, Ellesandra held herself back. She took it slow, no matter how torturous it was for her arousal waiting. How wet she herself was, the heat in her own core at all of this. How knowing it would only take a few touches from Star for her herself to go over the edge; no, Star deserved to have this build up. This foreplay. To be touched and worshipped slowly. To have the intimacy of someone loving her, not just fucking her. So Ellesandra took it slow, continuing her current ministrations until she would feel and hear Star getting restless with it. And only then would she begin sliding her right hand up, slowly drawing Star's top up with her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star did have brief anxiety about touching their scars, but knowing it was more or less inevitable and that just brushing against them wasn't a big deal was enough that it came and went, not able to impact the moment and just kept in mind for the future. The kisses on her neck continued to have the same effect, evoking more pleased, slightly longer moans the longer this went on. Her breaths were getting steadily shorter, to a point. The excitement was building, though she was already more than a little wet. It was easy to feel like the arousal she had felt for Ellesandra earlier in the day when she was mounting them was a thousand years ago, but truly, her panties were still a bit damp from that even before the two started kissing. Now? Well. It was good that Star had magic for keeping her clothes pristine. She'd never been so horny before. And it was only getting worse every second. The heat of Ellesandra's tongue along her pulse had her tilting her head back with a shuddering groan. "Y-Yes.." she whispered. The slow, intimate nature of that little motion, the emotional weight behind the stroke of that tongue, it wasn't just physically arousing, it was a symbolic motion that stoked the intimacy between them, and that hit Star much harder. It was a clear showcase of what Star truly desired, and how on-the-nose Ellesandra had been from the onset. How if Ellesandra really wanted to please Star, it was these emotionally weighted, purposeful, meaningful motions that really got her going. Ellesandra was doubtlessly able to finger Star in a way that'd make her go crosseyed without an ounce of foreplay, but that wasn't what was truly going to satisfy her. Star had rebuffed so many other people in her past because that is precisely what they wanted to do to her. They wanted to fuck her. And even being a horny, kissless virgin hadn't been enough to make that prospect attractive for her. But Ellesandra just dragging their tongue along her pulse, as if wanting to lay affections directly onto her heart? Ellesandra wouldn't need auramancy to feel the reactionary heat flaring between her legs as it was pressed up against them. The grip on her, tugging her closer, was met with a tightening of her legs around their waist. Them inviting her closer was met with resounding acceptance and reassuring squeezes. The time taken, the slow and sensual buildup, it all was doing exactly what Ellesandra intended. They had found a spot to exploit, and Star was putty in their hands, squirming and shuddering as her arousal became more and more and more unbearable under the heat of Ellesandra's touch and tongue and lips. It wouldn't take too long for her to get restless and start needing to squeeze her thighs around Ellesandra's waist more regularly to try and quiet that throbbing between her legs, just long enough for proper satisfaction to be given. The motion to push her shirt up was met with her hands removing from the other woman, acknowledging their motion and raising her back just a bit to help them lift her top up and off her. And given she was in her nightwear, well...There wasn't anything underneath. So Ellesandra would get their first look at Star's topless self. Her flawless, pristine skin. Her delicate, curvy waist that smoothed outwards into wider hips to form her hourglass figure. The two pert and perky mounds upon her chest that had stiff, aching pink tips atop them. The spread of platinum hair behind her, splayed out like a fan as it descended down just a bit past the backs of her knees. Her hot, flushed face left staring up at Ellesandra, eyes full of love. Lips, still tingling from the kisses they shared, just barely open as hot breaths pushed through in tempo with her heavily rising and falling chest. The picture of a woman who was utterly, wholly smitten and equally as submissive to the knight above her. She bit her lower lip again, then moved a hand to the hem of Ellesandra's top and gently tugged on it. A little check to make sure Ellesandra was comfortable mirroring her state of undress. There was a desire in her, a desire that firmly wanted Ellesandra to press up against her, skin to skin. A longing in her heart, and in her eyes, for this. It had been said plenty how much stronger their connection might be if pressing their bare figures together, and there were only but a few items of clothing standing between finding out just what would happen if their nude figures pressed together.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra fed on every moan and pleased noise that Star made. There was absolutely no hiding how much Star showing, sharing, and making heard her pleasure and joy was the easiest way to get Ellesandra going. Her heart beat hard and she, too, was completely soaked at her core. Feeling Star's heat and need, as well as how she held onto Ellesandra with her legs. Again, it took a lot of effort to not grind down on Star. She noted how much Star had enjoyed the lick to her pulse, but didn't go straight back to do it again. Too much of a good thing would reduce the actual impact of it, so she continued licking and kissing along her neck and collarbone, and then pulling up as Star consented to her pulling her shirt up. Ellesandra held herself up as the night shirt was removed from Star, biting her lip and looking down at her bare chest and her open, excited face at this. Attraction was there - that was obvious - but there was more than just attraction and lust for touching Star. There was a desire to be close, to protect, to kiss and lick in an exploration way, not a pleasurable way. Her left hand came down, a finger running down Star's sternum and then between the valley of her breasts, not brushing too much against them and focusing on running her finger down the center of Star's torso more than reaching out to breasts to pleasure them. Just touching Star. At the tug on her own shirt, she glanced down - indecision there briefly. Ellesandra usually didn't remove her clothes when she was focusing on her partner's pleasure. Usually, she let all of it focus on her partner, to not distract them or herself from their pleasure. This was different, though. She wasn't fucking Star, and Star wanted the intimacy. After that moment of consideration, she would nod, letting Star mirror their nakedness, her shirt coming up over her head and baring her own chest to Star. Similar to Star, she wasn't wearing anything beneath. On the one hand, Star had technically seen Ellesandra topless before - in the memory, when she was getting whipped. However, there was a lot of other things happening at that time, and she very obviously wasn't in an arousing situation. Her breasts were on the smaller side, nipples hard and obviously swollen in arousal. There was a small scar on her left rib, not nearly as nasty as her other scars and much older than the ones on her back and arm, but otherwise her skin was smooth. The scar on her right shoulder was nasty looking, as well as being able to see the jagged cut on her right arm even from the front. With her shirt off, you could tell where the healing had been done poorly, how it cut directly into her muscle and why that effect her strength in it. But that wasn't the focus of them right now- right now it was the intimacy of their shared half nudity. When her shirt was fully off, and she sat up just long enough to give Star time to take her in, not rushing her movements, she leaned down. Over Star, and pressing their torso's together, Breasts to breasts, adjusting just enough to ensure their heights aligned in a way to do that. Pressing skin to skin, her elbows holding her up and slowly, gently, lowering herself down so their torso's were touching fully, Ellesandra's firm stomach - though not quite ripped abs - flat against Star. Ellesandra let out a soft breath as the physical contact happened, closing her eyes. This was new to her, this type of intimacy. She took a moment to enjoy the heat of their bodies together, as well as whatever their auras would do with this. Lowering her head, pressing her lips to the top of Star's shoulder and breathing into it. Taking a moment to just FEEL their connection.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

All of these desires, the desires for closeness and intimacy, were what fueled Star's heart to pound as hard as it did, and for each motion to be so impactful and mean something. Exploiting erogenous zone without the connection might make her make some cross-eyed noises, but it wouldn't be memorable, it wouldn't fulfil or satisfy her. Ellesandra clearly knew, or at least had good instinct on the matter, what Star needed. For even just something as simple as leaving that lick along her pulse to be something done sparingly, only when it was the right moment to do so, was exactly in line with how best to please Star. Repeated licking there wouldn't have the same effect. It had to feel...right. Just as when her top came off and, despite some nervousness that was inevitable for this being the first time she'd been topless before someone else, she was comfortable because Ellesandra wasn't just ravenously diving at her, despite the natural desire to do just that. The touch on her sternum had her eyes fluttering closed, just allowing that touch to reach her and be felt in her heart. It sent a shiver down her spine. Even if her sternum wasn't sensitive, it was how delicately and lovingly Ellesandra did the motion that made Star shudder, and indeed let out a tiny whimper of need. When Ellesandra's top came off, she already knew what to expect. She didn't focus on the scars. That would just make them both sad. Instead, she focused on the beautiful things. Things that weren't reminders of the pain of the knight's past, even if she did feel the scars didn't detract from Ellesandra's beauty regardless. It was the cruelty that spawned them that troubled her, but such thoughts were for another time, another day. For the moment, she took her first foray into intimate touching as she gingerly slid her hands along Ellesandra's sides, over their hips going down at first, then back up and along the length of their curves as if memorizing their shape, then back down to just...slowly slide her fingers over the flat of their abdomen, getting a feel for the strength under the skin. Star didn't really have a physical 'type'. Auramancy and the exceptionally strong emphasis on the core of a person, of the bond they could form, meant that physical beauty took a backseat. That being said? Star certainly still found a lot to fawn over, and there was no denying how her fingers trembled with delight as they rolled across Ellesandra's abs, smooth as they were, with a small pause to circle just her index finger around Ellesandra's naval a few times. Her hands then smoothed over Ellesandra's sides to slip along to their back as Ellesandra lowered onto her. Star gingerly pulled her down in turn. And when torso met torso, heart beat against heart, a strength to their connection never felt before blossomed within them both. There wasn't any new emotion to be felt. No new secret depths to explore. They were already bound, with resonant auras singing to one another. But in their past attempt to bond to one another, productive as it had been, it lacked one ingredient that was critical, central to auramancy: Love. But love was missing no longer. And now that it blossomed between them, a rising energy bloomed from this connection. It was a warm, beautiful feeling. Not arousing, but fulfilling. It certainly would not do anything to dampen their need to please one another in this moment, but it allowed each of their hearts to reach out to one another. You are safe. You are loved. You are my special someone. You are welcomed, and wanted. You are my everything. These words were not spoken, but simply understood. Reassurance more raw and pure than any words ever could be, it brought with it the banishing happiness of the calm place. Dark feelings melted away. And unlike that calm place, this potent reassurance had strength enough to weaken that darkness. It would surely come back, but now it would forever have to contend with this moment. A moment where Star's heart caressed Ellesandra's, and theirs in turn caressed Star's, to profess their deepest, most sincere reassurances and affections to one another. A depth of intimacy that delved into the mystical, more than just physical. While they held one another, a pulse of magic flowed through Star, powerful and grand as it tapped into the truest potential of her powers. The result? Two ethereal wings, with crystalline feathers, spread from her back. Intangible and transparent, they spread wide, then gingerly closed around Ellesandra, vanishing again as they slowly embraced them. The feeling was so soft. So soothing. Still not about to calm their raging arousal, but...Something came along with that feeling. A small piece of Star passed from herself, to Ellesandra. And when Ellesandra again looked at Star? Star's aura was there to see. Shimmering and pink in the moment, Ellesandra now saw Star the way Star saw her. Nothing practically changed from this in terms of their night of lovemaking, for those emotions Ellesandra now saw were emotions they already had been feeling with the close proximity. But come morning, it would no longer be only when close, or touching. Though the colours may not make sense for some time, the piece of Star that now lived in Ellesandra would ensure that the knight could always know if Star was in distress, if she was sad, happy, content, hungy, horny...It would take focus. It was not ever-present. But Star had, willingly but also not strictly intentionally, given a part of herself to the woman she loved. Star still did not know the nuances of her power, and this was one thing she did not know to expect. But there was no hesitation, only loving acceptance of this. A loving acceptance that, as she realized what had changed, she leaned over and gave a few slow kisses to Ellesandra's cheek, and then locked onto their lips if they gave her access to do so.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had let Star touch her, explore her, what she wanted to touch. The feeling of Star's hand on her stomach, her sides, made her swallow down the desire to rush things again. It still wasn't right, not right now, but god did she want to get Star entirely naked. When their bodies came into contact and she felt...Star, entirely, all of the love and comfort, there had been a moment of hesitation. A moment of those dark thoughts telling her that she was going too far, that there was no turning back if she continued; that she would ruin Star's life if she did. It was momentary, and her own desire, affection and love for Star covered that feeling up, along with feeling Star's acceptance and their bond push those dark thoughts out of her almost entirely, but it had been there for a brief moment. What she had not expected in any situation was Star to grow wings. Her eyes had widened and she'd prepared to move quickly, as if this was a threat - even though the calm and desire and comfort that she felt from Star showed anything but threat here. Confusion swirled as she felt the wings wrap around her and then she - she just saw Stars aura. Like when Star was meditating, or when she'd blown her emotional gasket, so to speak. Star had also actively shared this with her once, and Ellesandra had disliked it then. Now, she wasn't sure how she felt about it. There was definite trepidation, but they were already in contact and she was already feeling most of what she could currently see anyways. She wasn't aware this would be a longer, more permanent thing she could do - and they could have that conversation later, or tomorrow. For now? Ellesandra let her face be pulled up to lock lips with Star again, letting the kiss distract her from those worries and confusion and pull her entirely back into the moment that they had been having. She pressed her lips to Star's, though if Star tried to do anything in the kiss Ellesandra would let her lead. This was the first kiss that Star had initiated, so Ellesandra would follow her lead if there was one. If not, she would make it like she'd did before - soft, but intimate. Gentle loving kisses. Her right hand stroked up and down Star's side, fingertips lightly drawing over the ribs where she'd felt Star enjoy it before, but then also coming up and running along the outer edge of Star's breast. Not enough for full contact, especially since Ellesandra was laying on Star, but enough to tease it. To tempt it. And then Ellesandra lightly ground herself down, her whole body moving up, then down Star once in the kiss. An active movement to apply just a little bit of pressure between Star's legs, but most importantly create friction and heat, movement everywhere their skin touched. A hint at what was to come, a method to work on increasing Star's desire once again.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the trepidation. She felt the uncertainty. She herself was uncertain about...what that was. But she knew it was part of herself. She knew it was spawned out of love, a love that she had been feeling but not quite understanding. That understanding was slowly coming unto her, however. Quietly, in the back of her mind, she had to consider what else this emotion could possibly be. There was nothing, of course. It was love. And though she was feeling it for the first time, she would come to accept it and understand it. It was, truly, the most important emotion for her. This would all come later, however. There was nothing but focus on their lovemaking now. She took the lead on the kiss, tentative and unsure but flush with desire to do so. She tried to mirror what Ellesandra had shown her. Tender, loving kissing. Some with tongue, some without. Some longer, some short meeting to suckle on one or the other lip. One hand caressed their cheek, and soft, breathy moans mixed into the quiet sounds of their kissing. Being teased on her breast evoked a small shiver, though the grinding the followed evoked a stronger one paired with a groan that broke their kissing. Star took a moment to breathe, forehead resting on Ellesandra's. "H-Haahh...Hahh...E-Ellesandra.." she whispered, breathless. "Mmnh..." Her legs squeezed tight. "I-I can't take it anymore...P-Please take me, a-all of me..." Words punctuated by one foot hooking her big toe into the rim of Ellesandra's pants, tugging it just slightly down and then stopping. Once more, asking rather than doing, to wordlessly express her desire for Ellesandra to be fully nude with her. Partly for the comfort of not being the only naked person, but mostly because she wanted to admire Ellesandra's nude figure, and while their expectations might be yet unspoken and potentially not aligned, Star absolutely was of the mind that Ellesandra wasn't going to be able to just please Star and be done with it, though the only hint to that was currently just Star's general hunger for Ellesandra. A hunger that was already immense, and growing by the moment.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let Star lead the kisses, enjoying them all the same. She didn't hide that she did, smiling into it and letting a soft groan rumble in her throat. This was even more so when Star herself made the quiet sounds, but the groan that broke the kiss? Ellesandra's head dropped, forehead resting on Star's collarbone and she closed her eyes. The groan, and then the begging, god they did something to Ellesandra. She didn't think it was possible to get more aroused than she'd been. She clenched her teeth, not fighting her arousal per say but fighting the temptation to just rip Star's clothes off, even with her begging to be taken. Ellesandra took the moment she needed to just breathe and...enjoy their feeling like this, focus on taking it slow, remind herself that this was Star's first time and she needed to make this as good as possible for her. It was with that in mind she raised her head to look at Star again, a sultry little smirk on her face now. "Patience, Star." She whispered, moving her body up and intentionally grinding only her torso down while she did so. She didn't trust that if she did much grinding between Star's legs she might not orgasm early, but providing additional friction on their torso's should have the desired effect of feeling good, but not pushing Star over the edge. The movement up had another purpose, placing Ellesandra's mouth near Star's ear. She lightly kissed her earlobe again, this time pulling it into her mouth and sucking softly. Her tongue flicked it, gently playing with it before releasing and whispering in that same sultry tone. "Trust me, I will take and taste every inch of you before the night is through." Ellesandra hadn't resisted Star tugging at her pants, but she also didn't actively help remove them. They'd come off soon, as would Star's, but Ellesandra wasn't there yet. She lowered her head to press a kiss to the top of Star's shoulder again, and then began to move herself downward. Pressing the hardened tips of her nipples against Star's body as she slid down, so Star would feel her arousal and the tension as she did. She lowered herself to where she had easy access to kiss along her collarbone, down her chest to her sternum. Gentle, slow kisses. Teasing, as she began to kiss around the curve of one breast, her hand moving up to lightly cup around the other, both mirroring that while they touched and lightly caressed, they didn't even come close to the spots that needed Ellesandra's touch the most. She was also focusing on determining based on how Star was feeling, just how much teasing she could take. Ellesandra could tease all night, but she wasn't going to - especially not for their first time. When she felt like Star was tipping from enjoying teasing into frustration, she would immediately change tact and move up, letting her tongue slide over one nipple, and then doing the same with the other. And then taking one in her mouth, giving a soft suckle. Pants, and everything after, could come later. Star was going to experience everything about this foreplay first.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was a bundle of needy hunger that Ellesandra was rightly denying for the moment. Star wanted to experience the beauty of the 'main event' that was looming, but she was full of inexperienced impatience, a gnawing need that had built over years of denial of not just other partners, but herself. Knowing Star had never had an orgasm, never even touched herself sexually, left so much for Ellesandra to imprint upon her, so much for Star to be shown they could take a lot more of this gentle, blissful agony than she believed she could. Haste would be a mistake Star didn't realize she would be making, and Ellesandra's call for patience and commanding promise, specifically asking for trust, did something to Star that Ellesandra would certainly feel. A rush of heat between her legs. A bright blush on her cheeks. A shudder in her hips. Actively hearing what Ellesandra was going to do to her evoked a strong submissive feeling in her core. Not that it likely would be much surprise to Ellesandra, but Star was certainly discovering how much she liked that Ellesandra was the one taking the lead, being the more experienced, being the dominant one. That Star was submissive was about as surprising as the sky being blue, but it still was a journey of self-discovery for the auramancer. Star gently nodded. "I-I do trust you," she breathed out, squirming as the attention to her ear stirred hazy rushes of excitement through her. Then, Ellesandra's lowering had Star's hands moving to find something else to do. Touching Ellesandra's back from this position would mostly be over their scars, and she didn't want that. So instead? One hand tangled in Ellesandra's hair. Not to grip, just to hold, and maybe slide her fingers along Ellesandra's scalp and the back of their neck. The other reached for Ellesandra's hand, aiming to lace their fingers together. Holding hands was something she had wanted to do for a long time, though she wasn't imagining her being topless and under Ellesandra was going to come before hand-holding. She had no complaints, however, and not just because the only thing she could do was loose whimpering moans while Ellesandra's nipples pressed into her abdomen, while their lips trailing kisses down her body to her breast, and felt that attention oh so very close to those stiff peaks that were begging, throbbing, crying out to be played with. Star's breaths were laboured, but what Ellesandra would find with their teasing was the despite Star being quick to beg them, she could take...A lot of teasing. Her wants were strong, and each kiss not on the nipple made her want it more. But patience was something she had in spades, and just being close to Ellesandra, touching skin-to-skin, was so gratifying to her already that she could focus on that and let Ellesandra keep teasing her. Frustration never truly spawned in Star, but there was a point, after several minutes of the same teasing, that it began to give diminishing returns. It still had the desired effect, Star was about ready to say or do anything just to get Ellesandra to finally give her the pleasures she craved, but having been asked for patience, she gave all she could, a feeling reinforced by wanting to be a good partner for Ellesandra, to do as asked, or told, and endure the rising tension, the haze, the constant pace of her heart that would not slow and only pound harder, all of this blissful agony of lovemaking as long as she could, trusting that it would be what Ellesandra had described: their 'way' of lovemaking that worked for them both. And of course, when Ellesandra did finally latch their lips onto Star's nipple, the results were...Intense. She arched her back into the other woman, both hands gently squeezing - mindful not to hurt Ellesandra as she did so - as her breath hitched and her entire body shook. The burst of heat between her legs was felt through her aura, sure, but Ellesandra would feel it physically, too. "H-Haaaauu....Hh...Nn-nnnnhhhh...E-Ellesandra.." she whimpered as she lowered her back again. Her throbbing sex squeezed tight, trying to find some manner of gratification to stave off this gnawing hunger, but it could not even come close to being enough. The attention on her nipples had Star consistently shuddering under the pleasures, eyes shut tight and tension clearly building in her. She was surely going to be on a hair trigger by the time pants came off, and it might just take a handful of climaxes to get her to calm down from the high Ellesandra was bringing her to.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was...pleased at how much Star could take. How patient she was in response to Ellesandra's request, how she obviously needed more than Ellesandra was giving her but she was being patient. She considered calling Star a good girl, and the words were on the tip of her tongue but she'd held back. While Star might enjoy that dynamic, and while Ellesandra definitely would, it didn't feel like the right dynamic to enforce right now. Sure, Ellesandra was leading and being dominant, but she wanted the power to be equal for Star's first time. She didn't want to indicate to Star that not doing as Ellesandra said would make it so she wasn't a good girl. So, she held back from that. And when the diminishing returns had become apparent, she'd moved to her nipples. And oh, how Ellesandra had enjoyed Star's response. There had been a moment of concern that she might be having an orgasm from nipple play alone - Ellesandra hadn't been with anyone who did that, but knew it was possible. But no - Star had just very, very much enjoyed it. It sent waves of satisfaction and pleasure through Ellesandra herself. There was no hiding how much enjoyment she was getting out of doing this to Star - even without auramancy. With it? Star would be able to see this type of thing was close to an actual orgasm for Ellesandra - and it lasted much longer. She was smiling as she heard the noises, the whimpering, and the hand in her hair. She'd relented to having one of her hands held, squeezing lightly as Star lowered her arching back onto the bed again. The absolute heat and desire, the need and physical feeling she felt from Star was enough that Star wouldn't be the only one to cum on a hair trigger. It was with this in mind that after giving an equal amount of attention to each breast, she began kissing down instead. She had a strong suspicion that if she kept building Star up she could, indeed, get her to cum from breast play - but that wasn't going to be what she wanted this time. Later, definitely. But for Star's very first orgasm? Ellesandra fully planned for it to be given by her mouth on her heat. Her lips lightly kissed down Star's stomach, circling her navel, then down to the waistband of her bottoms. And then, she ran her tongue back up to her naval, circled it, and back down. She pulled her hand away from Star's to lightly tug at the band, as if about to pull it down, but she didn't. She instead kissed along the edge of it, teasing even more. Making just the act of pulling her pants off a teasing act as well. Just like before, she did this until she could literally feel it either not working as well, or Star getting too built up. The auramancy made this easy, since normally she'd have to go just on responses and guessing to determine how much was too much for teasing. But she'd slowly begin pulling Star's pants off, leaving the panties on beneath. And when she did, she pulled them torturously slowly off. Kissing along her thighs as skin was bared, actively avoiding the heat that Star really needed her attention on, but still keeping her lips pressed to every new inch of skin she revealed.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's inner peace, her emotional calm, her experience living as an auramancer, allowed her to wrest great control over herself. Had she none of these things, she'd easily just be a ball of frustrated lust at this point. Ellesandra was too good at this compared to her. They knew just what to do, where she knew nothing. Her auramancy would certainly give her all she'd need to figure it out at lightning speed, but that didn't give her the understanding of what spots to target in the first place. The exploration of her body was as enlightening about her own sensitive areas as it was to how one went about making love to another person in the first place. Knowledge she would use against Ellesandra in time, certainly. But she would have never, before this time together, been able to conjure up the idea of tugging clothes off so slowly, and how much the teasing from that could stoke her fires. She continued to whimper and moan and lightly gasp under the trail of kisses across her abdomen; Ellesandra would feel that while hands were excellent, kisses on her abdomen were all the more potent. The heat of their lips, the intimacy of kissing, it all left Star squirming and forced her to redouble her patience, even as each time she thought Ellesandra was going to be bringing her the pleasures she craved, they proved to have another way to tease her and double back to kissing some part of her. Star was also particularly sensitive on the patch of her abdomen between her naval and her waist, so trailing kisses or tongue down that line had her groaning out a prolonged, approving sound of pleasure as her hips shuddered. She couldn't hold onto Ellesandra's hand anymore, so she moved her hands to the bedsheets instead, being far more liberal in grabbing fistfuls of that to give a little relief. Still, aside from her squirming and occasional light arching of her back, she stayed still for Ellesandra. "Y-Your lips are amazing, Ellesandra.." she whispered, not really in possession of any inhibitions on what she was saying. She was too far gone for that. And as Ellesandra trailed their kisses onto Stars freshly bared thighs? She pulled her legs together, snapping from the sensation of the kiss, but of course caught them before she could smoosh Ellesandra's had in a vice between them. Still. Ellesandra found another good spot. Inner thighs were not an uncommon sensitive spot, but Star wasn't used to this sort of attention, and so every kiss was that much more potent as Ellesandra was the first person to ever kiss Star in these places, in this way. "F-Fff...Hnn...Hh...E-Ellesan...S-San...d-dra..." she whimpered, her legs quaking. Subsequent kisses weren't triggering the same sharp response, but Ellesandra would certainly feel that every kiss, every drag of the tongue, was shooting lightning bolts into Star's core. "I-I feel like I'm gonna go crazy.." she said between soft moans. And of course, Ellesandra would see between Star's legs that her panties were entirely soaked through. The fine material they were made from clung to her shapely hips, and while it did cover her intimate core, that Star had become wet enough for the edges not covered by her panties and the base of her inner thighs were also glistening with her arousal. The heat from her core was intense, and while she was still able to take more, it was clear that this lesson in foreplay went far, far beyond just getting her ready to enjoy being loved on by Ellesandra's mouth, a sight that would serve as irrefutable evidence to any lover that Star was, without any doubt, loving every single second of this.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt her heart swelling with each noise that Star made. She made special note of the area between Star's naval and waist line, knowing she would return there eventually another time. That was a fun place to tease at, considering how much Star seemed to like it. And the inner thighs snapping together had sent a shock of joy through her, not only because it meant all the teasing was fully working on Star, but she could tell just how much Star NEEDED it. She had done her best not to look at Star's core, the heat and wetness there, while pulling her pants off, though of course she hadn't been able to entirely avoid it. She knew, however, that if she spent too much time looking or smelling or paying attention to how much Star obviously needed her, she wouldn't be able to instill patience in herself to keep this up. She'd go straight for her reward, which she knew logically wasn't the best move yet, but god did she want it. She kissed down along Star's calf as she lowered herself with Star's pants, until she was able to slide them off. She kissed Star's ankle, though didn't go lower. She did spend enough time around Star's foot to get an idea if Star enjoyed that or not, but Ellesandra wasn't much of a foot person herself. She'd note it for future, and would use it if Star seemed to enjoy it, but right now she'd focused on starting back UP the other leg. Except going up, she went slower. Licking at the corner of Star's knee, kissing oh so slowly, while her other hand gently massaged and rubbed at the muscle. She went slower because she knew Star's mind would be focusing on one thing - the place where Ellesandra was headed to, and going slower would make that wait all the more hard. She did eventually get there, hands lightly brushing over her pelvic area and feeling the fabric of her underwear. She lowered her mouth, over the underwear and placed a single kiss to Star's folds. Not a direct touch, and not enough pressure to do more than give a hint of the need there. Ellesandra's arousal was at a peak, being between Star's legs like this, seeing and smelling and hearing, and FEELING, her need. She let a thumb track down the right side of Star's heat, tracing the outer lip along the side so there wasn't direct stimulation at all even if Star jerked a little. And then she did the other side was well, Star's panties still on. She raised her head, lips hovering over where Star's clit was beneath her panties and just...breathing on her. Hot breath washing over her, before kissing ABOVE it, not directly on it, even through underwear. And then up more. And then she took the hem of her panties in her teeth, and began pulling them down, eyes up to watch Star as she did so. If Star was looking, Ellesandra held her eye contact, pupils dilated with her own arousal and need, her hunger to taste Star and bring her to climax. Not yet though...not yet.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The kisses grew less intense as Ellesandra traveled down her legs. She wasn't big on feet either, it seemed. It shifted from the physical arousal to a more tender intimacy. Star could certainly enjoy Ellesandra giving some loving attention to her toes or the like, but it did not strike any hidden desires or reveal anything about her sexual preferences. Not much point to lingering, though the steady trace back between Star's legs by going down the other leg was achieving its torturous goal well. She closed her eyes and balled her hands full of bedsheet to squeeze while keeping her shaking body as still as she could. She was on the edge. She had been primed to the point of bursting. Her whole body was numb, hot, and tingly. Being touched on her outer lips was, much like how when the woman touched her breasts but not her nipple, building anticipation in her. Anticipation that was denied again, and again, as hot breaths splashed against her panties, letting her feel the HEAT of Ellesandra's breath, of their lips that were oh so very close, without being given the pleasure she craved. Her heart was beating in her throat at this point, and the tension in her body was clear. Every muscle had been put on edge. Her panties were curiously made of quite fine material, perhaps unsurprising given the dress she wore when Ellesandra first met her, but they did have a certain allure to them with the sheen and softness the material had, with just a tiny bit of frilly, girly lace to accent the azure garment. She opened her eyes, panting, as Ellesandra began to pull her panties off with their teeth. The eye contact. The gesture. The anticipation. Star had never wanted more to just thrust her fingers inside herself to get some sort of relief. She didn't, of course. That was Ellesandra's prize. She'd not date take it away. But Star was certainly at her limit. Ellesandra could feel the heat, the throbbing need in her, and how tense and on edge she'd become. One solid injection of pleasure was all she needed to explode and release this tension, but Ellesandra held the keys to that release. That didn't stop Star from begging, of course: "P-Please.." she whimpered, offering nothing more to that plea. There was some expected nervousness, some anxiety spreading from her heart to Ellesandra once her panties were removed. Nobody had ever seen her naked like this. Was she ugly? Was it weird looking? Abnormal? Was she not good enough for Ellesandra to want to continue now that they'd seen her? Was it gross how wet she'd become? Exact thoughts couldn't be discerned, but the need for reassurance was clear. She was clean shaven, smooth as could be, and her virgin sex was as delicate and feminine as Star herself; soaked pink petals that begged to be tended to. Star hesitated, nearly closing her legs from the anxiety, but her love for Ellesandra and desires to be fully open with the other woman in all ways overcame that, hoping deep in her heart that she'd feel something from Ellesandra that soothed her worried heart. While it was likely that Ellesandra would only be using their lips on her, it remained true that, should Ellesandra explore her fully, they would find her hymen was still intact.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra almost came undone at the sight of Star bared before her after she'd come back up, begging again. Her eyes had dropped from Star's own to take in the sight of her, and despite feeling the anxiety and self doubt that came from Star there was no misunderstanding the arousal and desire that filled Ellesandra at the sight. Star's need was obvious, how wet she was, how she was so swollen and needy for Ellesandra to give her the touch and pleasure that she'd been craving. She licked her lips, hands sliding down her inner thighs to part her legs, letting her thumbs run along the crease of her thighs, close to her heat without touching. Lightly spreading her apart to see even more of her wet need. She swallowed, and barely got the words out. "By Torm, you're beautiful." The hushed, awed whisper would leave absolutely no doubt that Ellesandra liked what she saw. Not just liked - wanted to worship. She leaned in, slowly, and pressed her lips against Star's core. A kiss, letting the arousal coat her lips and then licking them to taste her. And then she looked up at Star. As long as Star was capable of it, she would maintain eye contact for the next bit. She let her tongue run up along Star's slit, starting at her entrance and slowly running the tip up between labia. Her hands moved to wrap around either thigh and hold them there on either side of her head, while her tongue circled Star's clit. She knew Star would be pushed over the edge quickly, but she still wanted to guide Star into her first orgasm gently, not go straight for the sensitive nub. She let her tongue brush only gently against it, then going back down to slip inside of her just enough. She'd finger Star later, but this time, Star's first time, was going to be with her mouth only. And she was going to continue her motions and efforts even as she felt Star tipping into an orgasm, keeping them slow and gentle. Enough to extend the orgasm a bit, to ensure that it wasn't just a quick one and that Star could truly bask in the feeling of it for more than a single peak, but she also didn't try to give Star multiple. Not yet. She could make Star's head spin with pleasure later, but right now she wanted Star to be able to just...experience it. And god, did she want to taste Star as she did so.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Of all the ways that Star expected Ellesandra to respond to the sight of her naked, invoking the name of a god wasn't among them. She knew Ellesandra wasn't particularly religious, and neither was she of course, but she couldn't recall any time hearing the knight invoke that name before. Given the context, she could only assume it was a good thing. The reassurance was much needed, indeed, and helped to quiet those anxieties. Mostly for being called beautiful. A feeling that echoed with how she felt when Ellesandra looked at her in that cute new outfit she had bought, and how they looked at her when she briefly had those fox traits. Different circumstances, naturally. Different emotions behind each stare. But to have Ellesandra so wholly focused on her, to look at her, to be praising her, to be smitten with her, infatuated by her, entranced, enthralled...In love. Star craved it so, so badly. There was not another soul in the many worlds that she wanted to be beautiful for. Only for Ellesandra did she care so much about how she was perceived, and to be called beautiful filled her with such deep validation that she was able to fully relax once more. Or, well, relax emotionally. She still felt like she was going to snap in half from the tension in her core. The tongue that pushed against her heat evoked a hitched gasp. A violent shudder went across her entire figure, her hips bucking just slightly. "A-Aaahn--! N-Nnh...S-Sorry!" she gasped out, face already too flushed to flush any more at her nervous jolt. The poor bedsheets were being squeezed within an inch of their life. Star kept her eyes on Ellesandra, finding the sight of their head between her legs utterly beyond enthralling. She couldn't look away. Her taste was ample on Ellesandra's tongue, with the direct stimulation to her core quick to make a small, hot rush of more of her nectar flow out of her onto Ellesandra's waiting tongue. "E-Ellesand..d-dra..." she whimpered, followed by breathy and heated moans. "Y-Yes...yes..yes...y-yeeess..." she moaned out, her back starting to arch as Ellesandra's tongue slowly dragged up along her slit, then down again with a tiny jolt from the contact to her clit, then another series of hot moans were Ellesandra's reward as their tongue circled her nub and then descended to push their tongue into her. Her entrance squeezed tight in response to stimulation of being penetrated, even if only slightly. It would not take much to push her too hard with penetration, even with such ample lubricating nectar, which if anything would only further validate Ellesandra's need to take things so slowly with her. Star was now visibly shaking, stuck on the very edge of orgasm. Her legs, her abdomen, her hips, her entire figure was trembling with pleasure, though she didn't quite know what this all meant or what was about to happen to her. It was surely going to be one of the most magical surprises of her life, with Ellesandra's beautifully tender care to bring her there so gradually. "I-It's so hot...N-Nnhg...Ellesandra...Ellesandra...g-gods...your tongue...Ghk...I feel like I'm gonna explode!"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Oh, it was a very good thing, her invoking Torm's name to swear about how good looking Star was for her. How beautiful she was with her legs spread and her need obvious, waiting for Ellesandra to feast. If Ellesandra hadn't already been in love...she might have fallen then and there. The immediate response and shudder from Star when Ellesandra's tongue slid against her brought a smile spreading across her face widely. The whimpering, the additional taste of Star that came out with her desire, her moaning out. Ellesandra's chest tightened at all of these sounds, joy spreading through her like one Star hadn't sensed from her before - not even in the memory where she'd been training with Sia. Pure bliss at making Star feel this way, especially so because it was Star she was pleasing - not just some random stranger she picked up in a tavern. There had been a momentary temptation, when Star said she was going to explode, to pull away. To edge Star into a larger orgasm, to make her wait more. If this hadn't been their first time, and more importantly Star's first time overall, Ellesandra might have. Test the limits of what Star could put up with in the name of a stronger, more intense orgasm - but no. For now, with Star moaning out and claiming she'd explode, Ellesandra dipped her hands from Star's outer thighs to grip her ass cheeks, fingers pulling her directly against Ellesandra's face and opening her mouth wide. She completely covered most of Star's heat, letting her tongue run up Star's slit again, but this time she didn't just circle Star's clit. She flicked it with her tongue, up and down. And then circled it with the tip of her tongue directly on the clit, intentionally stimulating to push Star over the edge she'd been getting closer to for the past few hours, since Amelia and Amara had left. The sexual tension being alone together had been palpable, and even with everything emotional that happened during that time - arousal had still been there. When Star did release, Ellesandra held her gently. She supported her legs and thighs, slowing her movements with her tongue down enough so that she wouldn't cause any over sensitization, but ensure the orgasm lasted for a few moments at least. She also did not hide her glee or desire to taste every bit of cum that Star had from the orgasm, wanting to make it very clear to Star that this was not a 'gross' thing or something to apologize for if she came hard. This was very much a wanted, desired thing, and Star herself was wanted or desired. She wanted nothing that was happening right now to be a later anxiety or self-image issue for Star. And through it all, her eyes were up on Star's face, watching, adoring.
<p>

Ellesandra's experience in all of this, their ability to know what Star wanted and needed when even Star herself didn't, made certain the climb up to this moment had been nothing but perfect. Everything that could have gone wrong or created awkward moments was deftly avoided, everything that might have resulted in frustrations or a diminished finale was something Ellesandra knew how to navigate. It wouldn't have been bad, ultimately, if the pair had stumbled through this. Understanding and love would have carried them through. But with that not even necessary, both of them could focus on this emotional moment together, and while Ellesandra's arousal and love were the prominent driving factors for what heightened Star's state so much during this moment, it was truly feeling how happy Ellesandra was that made it all perfect. Almost enough to make Star cry for how much their happiness made her own happiness swell in her chest. That happiness drove away any anxious thoughts or feelings before they could arrive. The love and depth of intimacy and trust she felt for Ellesandra kept her from holding back, from letting her uncertainty about this new feeling make her second-guess herself. It was a strange physical sensation initially, and if she was not brought to such sweet comfort by Ellesandra, she might resist her coming orgasm. But with their eyes upon her, their happiness at this moment swelling between them, she felt safe. Like everything was right. So she let herself relax into these sensations. Tension was still gripping her entire figure, but her heart let it all flow through her, just as she did with her emotions. And for that, her moans picked up in pace, in intensity, and pitch, rising, rising, rising, rising as Ellesandra flicked and circled her clit with their tongue, until... "H-Hhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa~~~!" came her cry, elongated and releasing every ounce of air in her as her entire body tensed and she mercilessly gripped the sheets with white knuckles. Her hips bucked, but were held nicely in place by Ellesandra's grip on her. Her orgasm hit her hard, and equally hard did she cum into Ellesandra's waiting maw. Quite a bit, in fact. Whether it was because of Ellesandra's perfect treatment, or because Star was naturally a bit of a messy girl, would take a little experimentation to figure out. Pulsing waves of her orgasm rocked her vigorously shaking body, causing hitched moans and bucking up of her spine in time with each pulsing clench of her inner walls that would have squeezed the life out of Ellesandra's fingers if they had been inside her. The orgasm lasted for more than a few moments, of course. With the amount of teasing that Star endured, it certainly set the bar high for what she'd expect from future orgasms. For a solid dozen seconds, her spine was curling and relaxing an inch or two as the pulses of orgasmic pleasure rocked her, culminating it one particularly sharp lightning bolt up her spine that was enough to finally break her forced spread of her thighs and was too much, causing her thighs to close around Ellesandra's head, quivering and quaking from hips to toes. She wasn't squeezing hard of course, but the involuntary snap did for a few seconds sandwich the knight's head between her plush, hot thighs before she regained control of herself and fell limp on the bed, entire body relaxing as shaking, panting breaths peppered with the occasional moan and shudder from an aftershock rocked her body. That she felt incredible was obvious, not just from her visible state, but also because, of course...Ellesandra felt exactly how strong that orgasm was, exactly how hard it had hit her, and while it wasn't like the auramancy directly transferred the stimulation to Ellesandra, it would be hard for anyone to not be aroused perhaps also to the point of climax by feeling how intensely they had just made their partner cum. And after it all, after Star's eyes were no longer forced shut from the pleasure, with eyes secretly rolled back in her head under those closed lids, she could only look back at Ellesandra from beyond the canvas of her heavily panting chest, her eyes full of love and adoration in equal measure.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra enjoyed every moment of that build up. As she heard the moans pick up in pace, higher, higher, and then the final cry as Star shuddered beneath Ellesandra. She had told Star before that this was her favorite part of sex, feeling a woman lose control of her body beneath her from pleasure. It was even more so being Star - the first time she'd done this with someone that she had an emotional connection to, rather than just sexual infatuation or lust. She took in the sounds, the feeling of her thighs that soon became wrapped tighter around her head, the arching of her back, the shaking of Star's hips and thighs as she came down. The taste of Star's cum - and the amount, which had been a bit surprising - all of this probably would have made her orgasm herself, without auramancy, if she'd let herself. Even with auramancy, she resisted it, resisted her arousal and how oh so very much all of these sensations worked for Ellesandra, how she could FEEL the peak of Star's orgasm - not sensation wise, but through their auras. It took enough focus and willpower to not have her own orgasm that she groaned into Star during the process, actively working to fight it down. While normally, she would be fine with this - even ecstatic to have her own orgasm by giving Star an orgasm - she didn't want her first orgasm with Star to be from that. She wanted to keep denying herself, keep herself on edge so when Star touched her, it would be quick. So that Star could feel that need in her when she touched, how aroused and wet she was for Star as well - enough so that if someone were looking at them from behind, they'd see her own arousal had already soaked through both underwear and breaches with a small dark spot. She wanted Star to be able to set her off easily and quickly, to build confidence in her that she could touch another woman like this, and it feel good for them. This was Star's first time doing this, and Ellesandra was being as mindful of making it easy for her as she could. There was definite sexual frustration building, but that was also good in a way. Ellesandra wasn't unused to being edged by others - she wasn't always a top, after all - so she could live and deal with it. Ellesandra refocused her attention on Star, and her coming down from the peak of her orgasm. Her relaxing back on the bed, her breaths coming hard. She watched her breasts heave above her, smiling at the sight of the flushed, sweaty, and pleased signs she could see in Star. With a single more lick up Star's slit, just barely brushing her clit, just enough to remind Star that she wasn't necessarily done and was just taking a break, Ellesandra began the climb back up Star's body. There was much more she could do to Star, and she was quite certain she could coax at least one more orgasm out of here considering she hadn't even penetrated her with anything but the tip of her tongue yet, but Star deserved to have a moment to just...feel, and enjoy the aftershocks and afterglow of this one. So Ellesandra crawled up, kissing Star's stomach along the way. She didn't move as torturously slow as before, just kissing in her process of moving up, pressing closed lips to Star's nipple, and then more closed lips to Star's neck. And then she was hovering over Star again, a satisfied cocky grin on her face while looking down at Star's flushed cheeks. She didn't say anything, but leaned down to brush her lips against Star's. To let Star taste herself, to get an idea of what Ellesandra had enjoyed below. If Star pressed into a deeper kiss, Ellesandra would happily comply, but otherwise when the kiss broke she rose back up to stare down at her lover. "Are you okay?" The words, whispered softly. It wasn't technically a needed question, with how Star's auramancy worked, but Ellesandra needed to hear it. Needed to hear that Star had enjoyed herself, and didn't regret this. Was still happy with this happening.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star yelped softly and shuddered when Ellesandra flicked her clit. Her legs pushed in together again, and the already present trembling briefly grew more intense. She was still quite sensitive, naturally. Star, however, hadn't a single drop of sweat to be seen. Not on her brow, not between her legs - though there was plenty of wetness there from another source - or even the expected sheen of sweat upon her. She was smooth and dry as could be everywhere that wasn't drenched in her arousal. She had certainly sweat before, but that had only been at times that her aura had been strained, or indeed when it had been broken and she fell ill. Just another quirk of this mystic woman, though surely if pushed hard enough she would eventually break a sweat. The kisses up her body evoked bursts of love in her every time lips landed upon her, with a sensitive squirm and moan when her nipple was kissed, and an obedient shift of her head to let Ellesandra at her neck when they rose up to that height. She wrapped her arms lovingly around Ellesandra's neck when they came in for the kiss, and there was absolutely no getting away with a simple brushing of the lips. No, Star wanted, needed a deep kiss after all that. She could taste herself, which was unique. She accepted this as she kissed Ellesandra, still so enthralled with this new experience. She hadn't kissed anyone on the lips before today, either, so even that had plenty of novelty in the experience of it that she was all too eager to explore. Star was still heaving, though, so she couldn't keep up with a kiss for too long. Her head fell back onto the pillow, her open lips flowing hot breaths out between them to splash upon Ellesandra's neck. When the question came, she wore a little smile. Being checked on felt nice, perhaps in particular because it was so unnecessary. If she was in a more playful mood, she might have just responded by asking 'are you kidding?', but she was in such a tender, intimate mood, that her response was loving instead: "I've never been more okay, Ellesandra...All of this is making me happier than I've ever been." Tears stung at her eyes, but she kept smiling, wider now. She was already blushing bright, so there was not much room for her blush to intensify as she said the one thing that was now demanding be released from her heart: "I-I'm...It's..." A little nervousness built in her as she tried to say it. "I-I'm beyond just...F-Falling for you, now..." She gulped. She had to say it. Her heart wouldn't allow her not to: "I love you, Ellesandra."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had expected the kiss, had returned it, had enjoyed the little tenseness and continued motions from Star at the other areas of pleasure she'd kissed. She'd expected Star to tell her that she was fine, or great even. Maybe a joke about it, maybe a request to return the favor, anything like that. What she had not expected, despite in hindsight it being definitely something Star would do, was a love confession. Ellesandra's heart just...stopped. And at the same time, sped up. There was a combination of pain and excitement in her chest, both dread and terror and happiness and reciprocated love. The emotions, insecurities and fears that had been driven out earlier came back in full force, slamming into Ellesandra and the moment like a brick. It was instinctive, for her thoughts to immediately go to 'no, she can't' and 'no, I'm unlovable' and 'that's a mistake, this is a mistake, stop it.' Even as she felt something in her fight back, even as the shadows weakened and her own affection for Star burned brighter, the damage had been done. There was no way that Star couldn't see the mixture of pain and self-hate within Ellesandra's aura at her confession, nor how Ellesandra had just...frozen. Her mouth was partially open as if she were going to say something, but she just...couldn't. The words burned in the back of her throat, her the flame of her own love for Star obvious in the eyes of her aura, but unable to be said. That she just couldn't bring herself to tell Star that she loved her too, could not force the words out, sent waves of shame through her too, adding to the shadows. Reinforcing them. Reinforcing the idea that she was not relationship material. Ellesandra tried not to pull away. To not ruin the moment. But that meant she just hovered there. Motionless, as if struck by the eyes of a basilisk. Her body and mind were warring with her heart, wanting to retreat, wanting to run away and leave the room - who cared if she were half naked. Her heart ached at the idea of pulling away though. Her heart sang at the confession, sang it's response even if Ellesandra could not verbalize it, sang to keep the shadows at bay from fully taking over. "I-" Came out choked, cut off. Tears sprang to her eyes again, and she closed her mouth, jaw trembling. She didn't know what to do. She was torn, the strength of her trauma still not nearly overcome enough to be in a place to admit her love for Star. To be able to say that to Star, and not fear she too would be killed, taken from her. To be able to admit that the future they'd seen together, in the trance, those desires was possible. And the fact that she couldn't admit any of this, that she was freezing when Star was being so vulnerable as to confess love to her, having just given herself to Ellesandra, the guilt of how that might effect Star, hurt her, hit as well. It just piled on, fighting against her heart, against Star's heart inside of her, the love that she obviously felt despite all of her issues. It was only because of Star's influence in her she hadn't just ran, but it didn't mean that defeated the issues in her entirely - they were still there.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star knew it was a difficult thing to hear for Ellesandra. She'd already gotten plenty of the emotions from them that Ellesandra viewed themselves as broken. Unworthy. She challenged those emotions at every step, and even if the zeal in her heart did make her perhaps a bit hasty with this confession, she truly believed that her honesty was the best thing to embrace. It was obvious to her, of course, now that she knew what that emotion was. And she felt it in Ellesandra, too. But she also knew that Ellesandra had a masterful ability to feel something and just deny that they felt it. So when Ellesandra couldn't say it back, Star just smiled up at them. She wasn't hurt. She wasn't even really expecting a return confession. She already felt what was in Ellesandra's heart. She already felt the overwhelming joy Ellesandra had felt in their moments together. That was enough, even if she did hope to hear Ellesandra say it back to her some day. With that smile, she leaned up and kissed Ellesandra again. Just a simple kiss, one that expected they not be able to reciprocate with their shocked state. She then moved a hand to cup at Ellesandra's cheek. "Shh...It's okay," she whispered. "You don't have to say anything. I just...Needed to say that," she said as she rubbed her thumb across Ellesandra's cheek to catch the tear. "You make me...So incredibly happy, Ellesandra. All I want right now is to focus on those happy feelings. I want to make love to you, too. If you'll let me. We can leave the complicated feelings for tomorrow...Even if I wish tonight never had to end, and I could just kiss you and hold you for the rest of eternity."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The softness that Star gave her, she felt she didn't deserve. The touch to her cheek. The kiss. Somehow, that hurt the situation more than it helped. It reinforced that Star had to take care of Ellesandra, to be gentle with her emotions, which Ellesandra hated the idea of. Hated that she would be the type of partner that Star would need to be careful of not accidentally making her run - because she would be a BAD partner. Still, Star would be able to feel the love - even if she could also feel the negative self talk increase. She closed her eyes, not able to look at Star for the moment and focusing on not crying. She wasn't going to cry just because someone was being kind to her, accepting her, trying to help and protect her emotions. She was not going to cry during sex. She would not cry at Star telling her that she wanted to hold and kiss her for eternity. But it wasn't just a matter of her heart admitting that Ellesandra loved Star. It was Ellesandra finally letting her heart admit that she wanted to be loved. Wanted to be held, to be kissed, to have that special person for all of eternity. The vulnerability that came with that, something she'd denied even thinking about for years even before Marigold's death, let alone after, was enough that Ellesandra began to shake. She lowered her head, pressing her forehead against Star's shoulder and taking in a deep breath, trying to calm herself. Trying to push those feelings down, to focus on the moment. To focus on their intimacy and sex, not on how every ounce of her being was telling her to run away and leave Star naked on this bed. Of how ever ounce of her commitment phobia was working on overtime right now, and the panic that was building in her chest. She didn't know if she could just go back to sex. The feeling of arousal - well, it was there, but it was so buried beneath all of this fear and panic that was only barely not taking over her that she couldn't actively focus on it. She kissed Star's shoulder, trying to bring that back up. To focus on the physical, not on the emotional. To repress all of that, like she was so used to doing. It was the only option in her mind, because the alternatives were breaking down mid sex with Star, or leaving the room. Neither of those were acceptable, not for Star's first time, not for their first time together. So she kissed Star's shoulder again. Then up her shoulder to her neck, keeping her eyes closed and focusing on the kisses. The skin beneath her lips. The memory of Star's thighs pressing against her head during orgasm. She let the physical need, the desire take over her emotional turmoil, to push it down into a box like Ellesandra was so, so good at doing. That Star hated, but oh well. It was the best option for Ellesandra right now, in her mind. She open mouth kissed Star's neck, where she had enjoyed it last time, before moving to try to engage Star in a passionate kiss again. To distract herself from these feelings, to focus on the arousal and desire in a kiss. Everything that Star had said she didn't want in sex, the lack of love and affection, Ellesandra was trying to do right then without even thinking about it because including that love and affection meant including so much that she just wasn't prepared to handle.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's honest heart had burned her before, steered moments off course into places it wouldn't have if she just kept her mouth shut. Usually, this was when she called someone out for lying, which was a great way to make people defensive. But in this moment, it was something she really had hoped it would be something the other woman could move past and they could keep going. Instead, she felt things she really didn't like. The way Ellesandra was treating her in the moments that followed weren't producing good feelings. It was producing worry, and actively turning Star OFF. But Star wasn't going to just let Ellesandra do that and say nothing about it, let them do something they would regret. She knew they were just trying to preserve themselves, keep themselves calm. But Star had another idea to accomplish that, though she wasn't certain it would work. Still, she had to try it. She gingerly pressed on Ellesandra's shoulder, suggesting they pull away a moment, and if they complied, she would keep that gentle hand trying to guide them along. Showing what she wanted, without forcing them, all while wearing a smile, to ease Ellesandra onto their back. And if Ellesandra complied, Star moved to straddle them, like she knew they had enjoyed before, and kept smiling down at them as she sought to lace her fingers together with theirs and tenderly pin them down on the bed below her, with her most certainly still bare, hot, and damp core resting on their abdomen.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra froze when she felt Star's hand on her shoulder, pressing on it. Stopping her. Had she done something wrong? Was Star rejecting her, now that Ellesandra had been unable to say those words back? She felt herself guided off of Star, to lay on her own back, but instead of Star getting up out of bed like Ellesandra had thought she was going to do, Star climbed on top of her. Well, ways to fix Ellesandra's lowered arousal from before number 1: This. She felt the heat of Star against her abdomen, eyes trailing up and down her body, not even noticing as Star took her hands and pinned them into the bed. There was no denying that this aroused Ellesandra strongly, but it wasn't the same as before. This was a lust arousal, and though her heart beat heavily at the feeling of Star's fingers lacing with hers, there was a serious hesitation to the same emotional connection they had before. Her heart wanted it, but she was still holding it back. Terrified of it. Ellesandra looked up into Star's eyes, topless but with her pants still mostly on. She felt more vulnerable than she'd ever had with a lover, though. The physical nakedness didn't make her feel vulnerable at all, it was the emotional rawness of the moment. Of her fear. Of knowing when she met Star's eyes, that Star could see the insecurities even if Ellesandra were pushing them down. And that Star would not let them go unaddressed. Star wouldn't grind against her, move up to sit on her face like the lust-mind of Ellesandra wanted, not until it wasn't just her lust mind wanting it. And it was with this that there was fear and regret and pain in Ellesandra's eyes when she met Star's, the emotional vulnerability evident. Knowing that she was messing up right now, but not knowing how to fix it. Not having the courage to just love Star and believe that things would work out. The last time she'd had courage in her feelings for someone, she'd been told that person was getting married to someone else. Now, while Ellesandra was fool enough to have courage in the face of physical danger, she looked...terrified, pinned beneath Star.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't hold any judgement or sorrow or pain upon seeing Ellesandra look so vulnerable. It was touching, for her. That Ellesandra could be so vulnerable to her. She felt an echo in her mind of when she had yelled at Ellesandra, and that did shake her conviction a little. A pang of regret. But it was as she had told Ellesandra. She did need to hate herself for that, because THAT was not who she was. So she had to hate that part of herself, so it would go away. It was, at least in her mind, a healthy kind of self-hate. A rejection of bad behaviours to be better. She had wrongly believed that Ellesandra, being so strong and stalwart in battle, might respond better to someone trying to snap them out of things or speak to them like Sia had. But that was just Star being desperate and angry and panicked. She was calm, now. And she embraced HER way of doing things. And HER was was gentle, sweet, and reassuring. She rubbed at Ellesandra's thumbs with her own, smiling down at the woman below her. The woman she wanted to call her lover, genuinely and completely, but could feel the fear that held them back. It had all been so much simpler when it was all unspoken, hadn't it? Star kept smiling through that. She leaned down, kissing Ellesandra again. A simple touch of their lips if she felt Ellesandra wasn't ready to reciprocate, or a more tender, loving, sweet kiss if they did reciprocate. She took the lead, focusing the moment on the emotional intimacy of it, not the physical. To do a little reset, and try and bring things back to what they were like when Ellesandra was making love to her earlier. The kind of lovemaking she was really enjoying, genuinely. She had, of course, not been lying about how happy she was with Ellesandra. She focused on that happiness, letting it flow, unspoken, into Ellesandra. She kept them gently pinned below her, her nude figure pressing wholly against the knight with legs sliding back a little to permit this and equal out their small height difference. She was slow, sweet, and gentle as could be as she hoped to guide Ellesandra back to a place of comfort. They might not be able to handle hearing Star's confession but...She hoped they could find comforts in her soothing, happy presence that sought to reinforce again, and again, and again, and again how much she wanted this, and more specifically how genuinely happy it made her. Ellesandra liked making her happy, right? She hoped that reinforcing that feeling, her own happiness with this woman, not specifically the love or commitment or any of the rest, letting just raw elation be the emotion she focused on to be most prominent in her heart be something that could let Ellesandra relax a little, while her soothing presence fought fiercely against the dark whispers she knew would constrict their heart and tell them that somehow they'd let Star down, or that pain was inevitable. Something to just reinforce this moment. To just let them both be happy now, no matter what the future held.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The thing is, this was the right thing to do to reassure Ellesandra. But it was also hard. Hard for Ellesandra to accept, to open up to. Emotional vulnerability was one of the hardest things for her, and she shifted under the discomfort of it. The brushing of their thumbs, the gentleness in which Star leaned down to kiss her. Her lips opened, and she wanted to lean in and press a searing, hot kiss to Star's lips. A lustful one. She didn't, but it also meant she didn't fully respond when Star was kissing her. She'd opened her mouth, accepted Star's tender, loving kiss in, but her response was...lackluster at best. She was trying, trying to not let her fears win, trying to feel that happiness she felt in Star and reinforce it. It helped, the reassurance from Star, but it didn't make it easy. She closed her eyes and pulled away from Star's kiss enough to clench her teeth. To shake her head - not at Star, but trying to shake the thoughts out of them. The idea that she had already ruined this, that she should just leave before she ruined Star. She focused instead on the flame of affection for Star. It was love, but even internally she couldn't admit that to herself, so affection was how she considered it. She focused on letting it burn brighter, hotter. To feel Star pressing down against her, to respond to it as it had before. She breathed in and out, tears pricking at the corners of her closed eyes, but not opening them. Those flames flickered out of the corner they'd been shoved into, burning at the shadows, at the dark thoughts. She pushed the idea of Star loving her down - not because she was rejecting it, but because that idea was too scary and tumultuous to Ellesandra's internal rhythm to focus on. Instead, she focused on the affection she felt for Star, and when that was her main focus, building up in response to Star's happiness just as it did before, she opened her eyes again. Star could ruin it again, tell her she loved her, but as long as Ellesandra didn't let herself focus on that, just focusing on her affection for Star, then it would be okay. On Star's side, from her standpoint looking at Ellesandra's aura, feeling that emotion, there was absolutely no doubt that it was love. That Ellesandra was actively fueling it, as if telling her in unspoken words that she loved Star too. Yet at the same time Ellesandra was lying to herself about what it meant. Her opened eyes met Star's...and her fingers squeezed at Star's hands, fully interlocking them now rather than just being passive while Star held hers. She didn't say anything, but the gentleness was back. The desire to just be there with Star, feel her. To make her happy. It was there, pushing that fear down.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star let Ellesandra pull away, aware of their needs and giving them the time they required to fight against those hard feelings. Star had no regrets for admitting her love. But that was just because she lived a life of open honesty. In her mind, Ellesandra could already feel her love, and she could feel their love coming right back. It was natural for her to just...Admit it. But in the moment, it helped her see how hard the trauma of their past was making it for them to do all of this. And that just made her love Ellesandra even more. They were trying. She could see them trying. She knew it was a process, and knowing how Ellesandra felt, even unspoken, was enough for her to not feel rejected by their need to push it all down. She looked down at them, her brilliant platinum hair flowing off her back from this posture to flow all along hers and Ellesandra's sides, gently tickling with those strands as they brushed against all the bare skin. "There.." she said quietly. "That's what I wanted," she said, squeezing Ellesandra's hands back, alluding to that gesture of squeezing and fully interlocking. She smiled sweetly. "You didn't think you were going to get out of this without me finding all your sensitive spots too, did you?" she teased as she leaned in to kiss the corner of Ellesandra's lips, then trail those kisses to their cheek, then jaw, then up to their earlobe to mirror what Ellesandra had shown her. A little intimate suckle on it before whispering in their ear: "The question is...Do you like being teased, as much as you like teasing..?" she purred, then nuzzled Ellesandra's temple before sliding back down to trail kisses to their neck, and see what was feeling good along the way while she kept the other woman so lovingly pinned below her.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took in a deep breath at the praise from Star. Well, most wouldn't consider it praise directly, but the confirmation that it was what Star wanted. The fact that this made her smile. That was fuel for the flame of affection building in Ellesandra, fuel to do more of it. But - well, it was hard to do anything while Star was on top, pinning her. The thought of forcefully unpinning herself to do things to Star crossed her mind, but she didn't act on it. She was remembering that this was Star's first time, and she'd need to explore Ellesandra as much - or maybe more - as she'd explored Star. Ellesandra's lips tugged up into a smile when Star mirrored what Ellesandra had done to her, though Ellesandra turned her head to lightly kiss along Star's cheek at the same time. Twisting her neck so that she wouldn't disrupt Star, but the corner of her lips would continue to press against Star as she moved past down to her ear. It was when Star lightly sucked on Ellesandra's earlobe that she'd feel a spike in desire, the sensitive flesh there responding well to the attention. She took in a deep breath and closed her eyes, considering not answering the question to see what Star would do. But then she lowered her head back down to the bed, arching it up to give her access to her neck. "Why don't you find out?" The words came out as a challenge. Unlike Star, it didn't seem like her neck was as sensitive of an erogenous spot from kisses alone, but it certainly felt good and was enjoyed nonetheless. While it was something Ellesandra responded well to if her neck was bitten or there was more pressure than kisses and licks, that was unlikely something Star would find out right now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star giggled softly. Focus on the happy. Focus on the good. The dark feelings were a thousand miles away right now. They were just embracing their love for each other, even if it had to remain unspoken. "Bold of you to assume anything could stop me from doing just that," she said with no shortage of teasing desire in her voice. Ellesandra would be able to feel Star's nervousness. How she was quietly second-guessing everything she was doing. Because, well, she truly did have next to no idea what she was doing. She was just trying to live up to some degree of what had been done to her. And at first, her kisses and licks left a bit to be desired. She was nervous, tentative, uncertain. But all it took was feeling something feel good for Star to have confidence flush into her. Any time she struck a good spot, her heart swelled with reinforcement about what she needed to do. Their neck not being sensitive, meant she wasn't going to put too much attention to it. She did, however, repeat the gesture that had been done to her when Ellesandra leaned their head back to expose their neck more. She slowly, very slowly, extended her tongue and dragged it up along Ellesandra's pulse. It wasn't some cute lick, some attempt to elicit shudders of lust. It was, as it had been done to her, an intimate gesture. An attempt to lay her love directly onto Ellesandra's heart. It was slow, but it was also singular. Not even considering doing another pass, she did it mostly just as an intimate mirror of what had been done to her. But the neck wasn't the good spot. So down she went, gently releasing Ellesandra's hands as she slowly crawled down, leaving a trail of kisses along Ellesandra's shoulder - their left shoulder, specifically - down to their sternum, and down between that valley between their breasts. She took her time, ensuring each kiss was warm, each kiss was intentional, each kiss was full of intimacy and love. She was the antithesis of roughness. Fine gossamer wouldn't feel so soft upon their skin. But even though Star had nervousness bundled up inside her, she had instincts, and auramancy of course, on her side. She found her groove along the way down to Ellesandra's sternum, so that when she was kissing down it, there was nothing held back. She reinforced in her mind that this was something Ellesandra wanted, and any positive response from the knight would reinforce that. She avoided their scars, not because she didn't feel the desire to kiss each and every one of them as some reinforcement that Ellesandra was beautiful regardless of these marks, but because she knew Ellesandra actively didn't enjoy the focus on them. So once she was done trailing down Ellesandra's sternum, she leaned onto her left side, putting her weight there even though she was certain Ellesandra could support her light figure easily even if she laid flat on them. From here, she dipped her head to the side, kissing up Ellesandra's ribs on their right side, while her hand traced gently along their left in equal measure. Slow, tender, and with fingers briefly lifting off their skin where she knew their scar was on their left side to avoid touching it as she continued up to their breasts. Her right hand gently moved over their breast, just...Holding it. Feeling it. Cherishing it under her palm and dainty fingers. A tiny squeeze came, mostly for herself, but also to communicate the tenderness of her need for them. Ellesandra would feel how squeezing their breast led to a surge of arousal in Star. It was new territory, after all. Having not even touched herself before, the notion of just touching Ellesandra's breast being so exciting was certainly something to chalk up to her inexperience. She didn't shy away, of course, though she was not touching their nipple just yet. That patience and restraint was something she was mimicking, even if she was still a bit clumsy and uncertain with those motions initially. She kissed up around on the opposite breast, on the side of it, then around in a slow circle around the nipple, as if tracing the outer edge of their areola, then gently nuzzled against just the areola. She seemed to like incorporating nuzzling into her motions, though how Ellesandra reacted to that would encourage or discourage her from doing it. Through all her motions, she did not aim for direct stimulation, taking her time to build up to things. But also...Knowing how much Ellesandra liked to please, having said so themselves, Star took a moment to adjust so that she wasn't directly between their legs, but instead had one of Ellesandra's thighs between her legs, so that if Ellesandra wanted to, they could push up against her soaked core. She wasn't going to return that, of course. No stimulation for them just yet. But she was certainly exploring the idea that the best way to tease Ellesandra might not be to directly tease them, per se, but to give them a chance to please Star even while Star was doing her thing, while denying Ellesandra the ability to go all out on Star, or bring her to another climax. It was experimental, sure. But some part of her intuition told her that no matter how good she ever got at physical teasing, it'd never be as impactful for Ellesandra as letting Ellesandra indulge in the hot delights of them pleasing her. Only in this position, Star had control over how much, exactly, Ellesandra was allowed to do that.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra did feel something...extra when Star licked her pulse. She'd had that done before, somebody nipping over her pulse and then licking it, but this time it was different. While the tongue on her neck wasn't anything special from an arousal or erogenous zone perspective, Star would very much feel a response to this mirrored action. The flame of her arousal and her affection for Star burning, mingling. In some ways, becoming one. She lay there as Star moved down, beginning to kiss along her collarbone and shoulder. These were all pleasant experiences, but not the same as Star's neck had been. In fact, Ellesandra felt a little...awkward, at the attention. Not nervous, but more of a matter of not being used to someone giving her such direct and prolonged attention like this. Typically, she would just tell someone what to do, or what she liked, but there was something to be said about Star finding that out on her own. As Star released her hands, she lowered them and lightly began tracing her fingers up and down Star's arms, her shoulders, just soft touches while Star kissed down her. Kissing along her sternum was nice, but when she began kissing up her ribs was the first time Star would feel anything more than just enjoying the affection. It was specifically her lower side, closer to where her hip bone was, that Ellesandra shifted a little at the desire that shot through her at the feel. And then when Star moved up to begin giving attention to her breasts, while also repositioning herself so that Ellesandra's leg was between Star's? That was...perfect. Ellesandra wasted no time in applying pressure to Star's heat, lightly flexing and moving her thigh to create a little bit of stimulation. Enough to cause desire, but not enough to stimulate into an orgasm or anything. Still, simply being able to touch Star there sent waves of desire flowing through Ellesandra, her arousal spiking back up again from where it had hidden itself during the emotional turmoil. Her pants were still on, which was unfortunate since Ellesandra would have preferred feeling Star's heat directly on her leg, but it was still enough to get her going. This, along with the attention to her breasts, would be something Star found Ellesandra enjoyed. Oddly, it wasn't the direct stimulation she enjoyed either. It was specifically what Star was doing - just squeezing, light rubbing to the fatty part of her breast, or the kisses and licks around her areola. Those spiked her arousal more than her sucking on the nipple would have. It was good that Star would be able to feel these things through their aura, though, because Ellesandra was surprisingly quiet through the whole thing. Her breath had hitched when Star had placed herself directly on Ellesandra's thigh, as well as deep more shaky breaths with the attention to her breasts, but unlike Star she hadn't actually made any moaning or pleased noises. She had closed her eyes, simply enjoying the sensations, her hands moving up to run through Star's hair and cup the back of her head, then release to go back down her back. She hadn't been quiet when pleasing Star, but this - while entirely spiking her arousal and obviously something she still enjoyed - wasn't reaching that same level.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star made a mental note of that sensitive spot. Oh? Near the hip? Well, that got a little more attention. She could tell quite quickly that what Ellesandra liked most was pleasing her. Which...Duh. Ellesandra said it outright. They were a pleaser. And they didn't dislike being pleased, but Star did have to think about how she might be able to use that knowledge to make something special for Ellesandra. She didn't assume it was a measure of just being really good with her tongue that would make it special for Ellesandra. No. Surely, better people than she had eaten Ellesandra out. A thought that didn't really evoke any jealousy as one might expect. Other people came before her. And most specifically, other people didn't receive Ellesandra's love like she did. Of course, she wanted to be important and special to Ellesandra, and part of that came along with wanting to be able to create sexual experiences that surpassed past ones. But she also wasn't so bent on her own ego that she imagined that had anything to do with her own (currently nonexistent) skill in bed. No, instead, she paused what she was doing, pushing her own weight up to move to straddle Ellesandra's waist again, but this time sitting straight, with her soft weight on Ellesandra's abdomen. She still had...No clue what she was doing, but this all sounded like it might work out in her head, so she thought it was worth a shot. "I felt how much you liked it to feel me on top of you," she cooed. "So...Now I have to wonder what it was about all of this that got you so excited. I still want to explore all of you like you did to me but...Something tells me the sight of me grinding against your abdomen and you not being allowed to touch me would turn you on more than hours of me sucking on your nipples," she said, moving her hands to slowly capture Ellesandra's hands again, fingers lacing together to try and imprison them. Slowly, of course, to ensure that Ellesandra had time to deny her if this wasn't something they wanted. "I can certainly sympathize with the idea that the most exciting thing you can feel is...Someone else feeling good.~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

When Star explored more at the hip, she'd find it was specifically her hip bone, the little divot just on the other side that led to her her pelvic bone, that was the most sensitive. It had been enough to make her shift her hips and press into Star a little, the arousal obviously being able to be felt by Star. But when Star decided to shift things so that she was moving to sit atop her again, even before Star spoke she could tell that was a right move. Ellesandra's eyes flashed open and she looked down at Star, eyeing her nude form up and down, and then the heat that was pressed against her abdomen. As she was reaching for Star's hips, though, Star took her hands and lightly pinned them. Ellesandra let her, though her eyes looked up at Star in surprise. There was a mixture of indignation, the desire to say no and to just touch Star, as well as pleasure and arousal at being denied exactly that. In fact, Star sitting on her and then pinning her hands had spiked her arousal more than anything else Star had done to her since this started again. Ellesandra eyeing the spot between Star's thighs, licking her lips in obvious desire to taste, to touch, but she was good. She didn't reach again, not after Star gently imprisoned her hands. Her breath came a little more ragged now, and she looked up to meet Star's eyes, once again dilated with the arousal that they had been when Ellesandra's head had been between Star's thighs. "You are...a very sexy and smart woman." Ellesandra had only actually meant to say smart, in regards to Star figuring out a way to get her going strongly again, but the sexy part just slipped out. It was entirely true, and she wasn't ashamed to say it, but she hadn't intended to make it as sexual and lustful as it had sounded. It was meant to be a compliment for her figuring out something like this, remembering how Ellesandra had enjoyed Star on her earlier, but it just came out almost like a line. She bit her lip to restrain from asking Star to move up, to sit on her face. Instead, her eyes trailed back down Star, admiring her. Taking in every ounce of her body she could see, appreciating it, and smiling all the while. Her hips pushed up to start a grind, a reminder to Star that with her hands pinned didn't mean she couldn't do anything here, though when Star did first begin to grind against Ellesandra she would get her first audible sound of pleasure. A groan at the feel of her, mixed from pleasure of feeling her drag those wet lips against her, and a positive form of frustration at not being able to touch or do anything.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's heart thud heavy in her chest when Ellesandra spoke those words. She stopped breathing, just for a few seconds. Then, she swallowed a lump in her throat as the arousal, the happiness, the heat of intimacy rushed through her. Rushed straight southward. A heat that Ellesandra could feel not just through her aura, but with a pulse of physical heat and a brief, subtle clench of her thighs in response to being so openly praised like that. Being called beautiful earlier had had a similar effect, but it was tangled up in all her anxieties. Anxieties that weren't really gone, but for her to do this, and have such a positive reaction from it? Oh, she liked it. She liked it a lot. The beauty of her inexperience was that she wasn't confined to prejudice about what did and didn't work. She had plenty of ideas of what was possible, what two women might do in bed together, and despite her innocence had certainly paid attention to all of those lessons from her more sultry-minded friends over the years. But she wasn't coming into this thinking she knew what worked. She didn't. So it was all based entirely on what Ellesandra liked. So without a doubt, Star was going to pursue this path. She bit her lower lip after those words digested in the seconds following. Her hands squeezed Ellesandra's. And of course, she smiled. A coy smile. Not so much reluctant to accept these words as simply unused to them. Though as her smile might reserve how she felt, her aura did not. If it hadn't been clear from all their time together, it certainly would be reinforced now that words of affirmation were one of Star's stronger love languages. "I like when you can't take your eyes off me.." she said, which was partly unnecessary; Ellesandra could see how their gaze, full of desire, made her happy. Yet, she said it anyway, not only because it seemed Ellesandra responded to words a lot more than speaking through their auras as Star was far more used to, but also just to continue to dip her toes into the waters of figuring out how much Ellesandra liked this sort of talk in bed. Something she continued as she began to grind her hips, her hot core, against Ellesandra, briefly giggling when the knight pushed up to encourage it: "I've never been so wet in my life," she said, words breathy and full of arousal and affection. She continued to focus on what Ellesandra did to her, digging into the rabbit hole of how deeply Ellesandra's pleasures and arousals were rooted in her pleasure, rather than their own. Hearing it said was one thing, but exploring it was proving to be another matter. She loosed soft, breathy moans while grinding her hot petals on Ellesandra's abdomen; the pleasure was there, but obviously both of them knew Ellesandra could be pleasing Star so much more than this, and that Star was keeping them from doing so was to feed into their sexual frustrations and stoke their fires, mindful of course that she didn't push so hard that Ellesandra felt the need to turn this into lusty fucking again. Keeping it in the reigns of intimacy was important to her. "And I felt you stop yourself from cumming earlier when I did..." she said as her breaths began to grow short again. "So I think I know exactly what I want to do to send you over the edge..." A coy little secret, of course, matched with a little grin and bite of her lower lip. She was certainly trying to be alluring, even if Ellesandra could feel how immensely nervous and uncertain she was saying these things. She was pushing herself, willingly of course, far out of her own comfort zone in the pursuit of discovering what Ellesandra liked, fueled so powerfully by being called 'sexy and smart'.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Star was so right. The way Ellesandra was responding to Star right now was similar to how Star was responding to Ellesandra kissing along the outside of her areola, teasing at her nipple. How she'd responded when Ellesandra kissed along the outside of her labia, going so slow so as to build need. This was very much the same. Feeling Star's arousal directly on her, and then her grinding forward and leaving a small smear of said arousal on Ellesandra's abdomen - she groaned. Her jaw clenched, fingers squeezing at Star's to resist the temptation of breaking her hold and reaching down. Her eyes had almost fully dilated, watching Star move atop her. Her eyes were mostly focused on the area where their bodies touched, where Star's heat and arousal and pleasure was obvious, but she did look up and down Star's body, and meet her eyes too. It wasn't Just the desire to pleasure her, to taste her. Ellesandra truly just enjoyed seeing Star naked atop her, tracing the curves of her breasts with her eyes, the way her chest heaved with breathing, the coy smile. Even if it wasn't a cocky one like Ellesandra would have been giving, it was still sexy as hell to see on Star's face. She grunted when Star commented on how Ellesandra couldn't take her eyes off of her, still just focused on her, knowing it was entirely accurate. The wet comment just made her want to feel, taste and touch more. She shifted, the discomfort at being teased with how aroused Star was and not being able to do anything doing a LOT to Ellesandra. Her own arousal was raising, her own breathing picking up. Her legs were tensing and squeezing together, as if needing the pressure of some kind since she wasn't currently being touched either. Every muscle in her body was tensing then relaxing, tensing then relaxing, trying to work the arousal through her body and resist the urge to take over what was happening. When Star commented on having known Ellesandra stopped herself from cumming earlier, and how she was going to get her to cum now, she clenched her teeth and let out a long, slow breath. If Star was meaning bringing herself to an orgasm on top of Ellesandra, that would 100% do it - even if that would probably lead to Ellesandra pushing her into more than just the one she gave herself. "I thought you'd rather get mine by your own hands." She finally said, the reasoning why she'd held herself back. She'd wanted to be on edge when Star touched her to help improve her confidence, and teach her the things that Ellesandra liked. Her torso shifted and she pressed her abdomen up directly into Star, trying to help with the minimal movement she had. She looked up to meet Star's eyes, and words weren't necessary to show how much Star was driving her crazy with this - in a good way. How being restrained from touching Star was both extremely frustrating, but also way more arousing than Ellesandra had expected to experience with Star, it being her first time. There was one part missing, though. Whereas when Ellesandra was touching Star, kissing her, the intimacy of that helped keep it less lustful and more romantically intimate. With this, Ellesandra wasn't feeling that nearly as much. She just felt the desire. So her eyes dropped to Star's lips and she spoke. "Kiss me. I won't move my hands." She would behave, but she wanted to kiss Star. If Star needed to move her hands away from Ellesandra's so that she could balance over her head while doing her grinding, Ellesandra would be good. But she wanted, needed, to put her lips on Star. To return the affection somehow. Just receiving the affection just...didn't feel right to her. It didn't work for her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had no intentions of just sitting and grinding on Ellesandra to make them cum, no no. She would make as much clear when Ellesandra responded: "You're very right about that. But initially I thought I'd do what you did...Kiss up your legs, tease you that way...But me being so far away from you where you can't touch me? I think I can do better," she purred. And of course, she could tell, happily so, that Ellesandra wanted more intimacy and affection. Star did, too. It was just important to her to pay attention to both sides of Ellesandra's desires - physical as well as emotional. At the request to kiss, Star didn't hesitate. She released Ellesandra's hands not for balance so much as the desire to cup Ellesandra's cheeks as she leaned in, holding their face as she leaned down to kiss them, whispering along the way: "Hold me." She wanted to add more to that. Something like...'darling'. But she was cautious about focus on how obviously intimate and emotional this was. Ellesandra was still scared of that. So she just kissed. Tender. Loving. Sweet. Tempted to nip but...Still too uncertain to take that step. She ground on Ellesandra still, but it was more her whole body now, and only just slightly. So slight it wouldn't disrupt their kiss, but would give a small bit of heat. Her hair once more splayed across her back and spilled over her figure, draping them both in that cascade of white. She didn't rush this. She didn't want Ellesandra to feel like Star was impatient to get them to their peak. She wanted it to be whole, and fulfilling. Not just a beautiful culmination of physical stimulation brought carefully to boil, but with the intimacy that was so very new to the knight. The deep, burning desire in Star to make Ellesandra feel happy, whole, fulfilled, cared for...Loved. So she let Ellesandra set the pace on this, kissing them while gently grinding to build the intimacy and heat in tandem while her heart continued to pour her love through her and into them. But once Ellesandra was satisfied, Star fully intended on taking the lead again to bring about how she wanted to bring Ellesandra to their peak.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Star telling her to hold her was immediately obeyed. Her hands moved from above her head to wrap around her back. One hand splayed fingers out on Star's lower back, perfectly positioned to help move and grind her down, while her other simply wrapped around her back. She didn't actually put pressure down to help grind, and after a second she moved both arms up to around Star's shoulders and neck, fingers running beneath her hair and against her bare back, the back of her neck. The more intimate form of the holding that Ellesandra was sure Star had meant - not the holding like she'd initially gone for, where she was poised to help Star pleasure herself on Ellesandra's body. The kiss that Ellesandra gave was tender, matching that of Star's. There was obviously a desire burning in her to push more, to make it more of a passionate kiss, but that was reigned in. Her lips brushed softly against Star's, her tongue gently gliding over Star's, her heart singing the words that Ellesandra simply could not bring herself to verbalize or admit to herself. While she denied it to herself and couldn't say it, her actions spoke the words nonetheless. Even compared to their first kiss, the gentleness, there was...more here. She pressed her lips up into the kiss, even as she groaned at the feel of Star continuing to grind on her. That was there, and there was no mistaking that Star had found a way to arouse her quickly and get her all worked up, but there was also just...desire to kiss Star. To hold her and kiss her, and stay like that forever. The type of feeling teenagers had when kissing and cuddling for the first times, wanting to just repeat it over and over. Ellesandra was far beyond that stage in her life, but this was still an all new feeling and experience. She'd never had someone that she truly cared about to do this with - after Marigold's unwitting rejection, she'd not let herself feel this again. The kiss broke much sooner than Ellesandra actually wanted, but the arousal was also peaking into the desire of the kiss and she didn't want the memory of that kiss to have too much desire and passion in it. It hadn't been her intention when she'd asked for the kiss. As she broke it though, she opened her eyes to stare up into Star's face, breathing heavily. Desire and love was written, even if only the desire was spoken. Her lips were parted, hot breath coming out onto Star's own lips, and she ran her hands down either side of Star's neck, fingers tracing the sensitive spot over her pulse that had been kissed before, then up to cup her face in return. A soft smile, but she was back to letting Star lead this now, to see what she wanted next.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's eyes remained briefly closed when their lips parted, just feeling their breaths, just feeling...Them. There was so much sensation, so much emotion to take in in this time together with Ellesandra. It was more than just a romp. It was more than anything Ellesandra had described, and indeed when she had asked them what it was like, she had done so in the hopes that Ellesandra could elaborate on the emotional side of it all. That they hadn't had been a clue in itself, though truly Star would have focused on this emotional connection regardless. That it was new for Ellesandra only made her ever-more gentle and careful with her motions. Being held the way she was, the tender strokes of Ellesandra's hands along her neck as well, had her briefly be putty in Ellesandra's hands. Head moved and craned to let them slide their hands around her however they wished, touching and feeling her. She had to reign herself in to avoid just...Basking in the sweet touch. And it was time that her plan, for however good or bad it would work out, came to pass. She ceased her grinding, then rose up from Ellesandra, dismounting them. The dismount was only temporary, however, as she crawled up the bed a bit, turned around, and moved instead to straddle Ellesandra's head, knees gingerly pressed against the tops of their shoulders and calves and feet resting on the pillow beside Ellesandra's head, though for the moment she was still extended upwards. Ellesandra got an immaculate view of Star's hot sex hovering above them in all its wet glory. "You're not allowed to touch me anywhere...Until I touch you there first," she said with a little giggle. "Those are the rules for right now. Okay?" Because, well...If Star teasing Ellesandra wasn't going to work nearly as well, she figured...Why not try teasing Ellesandra not with touch, but with her own body, and slowly let Ellesandra get what they want while she was still...Obviously in position to lean forward and dip her head between Ellesandra's legs once she worked their pants off to still get their release with her own hands, just with something else to spur on their flames along the way. Of course, she wasn't going to start this little game until Ellesandra agreed. Partly just to tease them, but mostly just to make sure her partner was comfortable with what she was suggesting.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

When Star ceased her grinding, Ellesandra's eyebrows scrunched up. And then Star dismounted her. There was an immediate feeling of loss, not having Star atop her like that, and she even groaned in disapproval. That had not been what she had expected and even without being able to see the disappointment in her aura, her face said it. That was, of course, until Star turned and began to straddle her head instead. That changed absolutely everything about how she'd reacted, and if it were possible for arousal to literally set something on fire - it would be happening right now. Ellesandra clenched her legs together tightly as the sight of Star hovering above them like this set in. They were already partway towards Star, moving in for a kiss against her, when Star set the rule. She froze, before lowering her head back down to the bed and glancing down between Star's legs towards where her face was. Her heart was beating fast and there was a NEED in her eyes, to touch Star, to not just sit here while Star touched her and was all wet right above her. She bit her lip, actively refraining from saying something a lot more naughty than the situation needed. They could play with dirty talk later, when it wasn't as focused on the emotional connection as this first time really needed to be. She took in a few bracing breaths, knowing the temptation of touching, kissing, licking would be really hard to resist. "Better go fast then. Killing me, Star." She muttered in agreement, looking back up to the arousal just a bit above her face. The desire written in her eyes shown as she just...looked. She would raise her hips or do anything needed to help Star get her pants off and situated herself, but her eyes were just taking Star in. Exploring and touching all those places that she physically could not yet, familiarizing herself with Star. Her hands were now clenched tightly at her sides, resisting the urge to reach up and take Star's hips to pull her down on her face. There was also a small amount of...self-consciousness. Anxiety, about Star actually fully removing her pants. The same type of anxieties Star had had when getting naked in front of Ellesandra. The 'what if she doesn't like what she sees' fear, always there just a little bit even in someone as experienced with this as Ellesandra was.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was oddly comforted by feeling the same anxieties in Ellesandra. She didn't need them spoken to know what they were feeling. But oh, was the shoe on the other foot, now. Something she'd make evidently clear as she threw Ellesandra's words right back in their face: "Patience, Ellesandra," she began, smirking even though Ellesandra was looking at the wrong set of lips to see that smirk. "Trust me, I will take and taste every inch of you before the night is through." She let those words linger in the air, spoken with a tone that knew, absolutely without a doubt, that she was feeding Ellesandra their own medicine. Sure, she knew she was killing them, but what in the nine hells did Ellesandra think they did to her earlier? That all aside, and Star's desire to please the woman below her stronger than ever, given just a tiny bit of haste by their plea. She bent forward, sliding her splayed fingers along Ellesandra's abdomen, slowly sliding down them until their naval where hands split off and moved to either of Ellesandra's sides to focus on those weak spots she found earlier. Getting back to exploring them, except now upside-down compared to earlier. She lingered a moment on that weak spot, seeing if that divot was equally sensitive on both sides of the knight, before mercifully hooking her thumbs into pants and panties together. She couldn't exactly pull them off with her teeth all sexily like Ellesandra did from this position, and while she HAD intended on being mean and declaring that touching over their panties didn't count, and toying with Ellesandra a little by doing that, she did actually believe that their assertion that she had to go fast was one given in earnest, lest Ellesandra start turning into a feral animal on her. Once the pants were off, she took a look at Ellesandra's bare legs and, of course, the sweet curve between, and then took just a short moment to...Take them all in, her love, admiration, and desires stoking higher and burning hotter, indulging in this final moment where they were finally fully bare to each other. Of course, she wanted to drink them in fully before deciding what exactly she'd say. As if there were even any words that could come close to expressing how in love she was. And if there were? Well. Probably too dangerous to say those right now..
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra ate her own damn words thrown back at her. There was frustration, but also a little bit of pride at Star doing that. She looked down between Star's legs back at her face and gave a mock glare, as if she'd upset her by doing it, but there was no hiding that she'd found it a little amusing. Frustrating, because damn she wanted nothing more than to just lean forward and run her tongue along Star again, but frustrating in a good way. And in a way that Ellesandra was barely holding back from. She might be a little bit of a brat if she wasn't in charge, but she was holding that in right now, not testing the limits or seeing what Star would do if she kissed at her thighs. So as Star began touching her, letting her hands splay out over her stomach where previously that heat had been, then slide down to her hip bones to give them attention, Ellesandra actually groaned aloud. Before it had been obvious those were sensitive spots, the inner part of the bone as she arched up, but with how turned on Ellesandra already was? How she wanted to take action right now, but couldn't? That just made the desire they sparked even stronger. There was no difference between the left or right, though Star would find lightly pressing - or nipping, if she did any of that - on the inner part of either got the best reaction. At this point Ellesandra was grinding her thighs together, shifting her hips side to side, and as Star began to push her pants and panties down, she gasped as her heat finally hit the cool air outside of her pants. She finished removing her pants with her feet, kicking them off quickly, but kept her thighs closed afterwards, tight. There was obvious arousal, having been smeared across her panties and then along her muscular thighs. Unlike Star, Ellesandra wasn't shaved completely. She was relatively trimmed, for having been out travelling and not in a single place to do so consistently, with a few centimeters of hair all around her lips and up above, all the way up her pelvic region. It wasn't long and unkempt, but also wasn't the bare skin that Star had. Interestingly enough, this hair was silver as well, though a darker silver than what was on her head. Instead, it looked more like the type of salt and pepper mix someone who was just hitting their middle aged years would have on their head. A mixture of darkness within the silver that was relatively unique, for pubic hair. And really, that was what had Ellesandra the most nervous. With Star having been completely shaved, she wasn't sure if that's what Star liked. And she hadn't exactly expected to be having sex tonight, so she hadn't prepared specifically for that. Droplets of her arousal was obvious within the hair though, trapping it some, and the hair was short enough that it didn't cover the sight of her heat itself, or the swollen nub of a clit from her current arousal. Ellesandra's breathing was heavy, and she was a little afraid of looking down to Star to see what she thought. With her average lover it wouldn't have really mattered; whatever, find someone new if they didn't appreciate her. But with Star, there was that emotional connection that made tossing the idea of Star not liking the way she looked away impossible. So, with nerves, Ellesandra reached up, around either of Star's thighs and ran her fingers down Star's sides, then to her hips - right where Star had touched her earlier. She didn't pull Star down onto her face like she actually wanted to do, but she still distracted herself with touching Star, dipping her fingers into the spots that she'd liked herself to see if Star enjoyed it too.

There was certainly no displeasure to be felt with Ellesandra having hair. It was natural. And with Star, when Ellesandra was maybe a bit more lucid and not burning with heat, it might be noticed that Star didn't exactly have razorburn or stubble. She didn't have hair under her arms or on her legs. So either Star had some exceptionally religious commitment to being hair-free and tools to make it effortless, or, more likely, there was some magic at work there. But seeing hair on Ellesandra? There was no hesitation once she had taken her time to drink in the woman's figure. Hands smoothed over the hair, gingerly trailing her fingers over it with affection and love. "You're so gorgeous, Ellesandra..." she breathed. "Beautiful doesn't even begin," she added, with the expected swell of affection and admiration swelling in her. She wanted to just...Dive in, throw it all to the wind and get Ellesandra cumming their brains out. But no, she had to actually live up to what she said, not just enjoy the little glare Ellesandra gave her and be done with it. She knew she had to be careful, because anything she touched became fair game. So after giving a bit more attention to their hips, giving a bit of pressure to find the pleasing reaction there, and still not being comfortable with using her teeth in any way, she smoothed her hands up and along the outer sides of Ellesandra's thighs, up to their knees. There was a limit to how far she could reach of course, so when she began to draw back, her touch tender and sweet as ever, she shifted just slightly so that she could hook one hand under Ellesandra's knee to gingerly guide the leg back, folding it back so she could bring their calf forward so she could kiss along the top of it to the top of Ellesandra's foot, planting a single, lingering kiss on the top of it in a sign of worship, not expecting it to evoke any sort of jolt from the knight for finding a secretly erogenous zone on their foot. But there was something quietly romantic to her about the gesture, as kissing a foot was widely regarded as lowering one's self before another. This was naturally in a romantic context, and only a brief point along the way, but one she hoped conveyed a warm affection to it. When she trailed back, it was along the inside of Ellesandra's calf, past their knee, and let their leg stretch out again as she trailed slow and purposeful kisses along their toned, firm thigh. Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...Each splash of heat was pushing in her affections, while also giving Ellesandra license to do the same to her. Truly, she didn't expect much of her kisses along their leg, but it was the torture of intentionally starting on the outside, where Star knew she herself was less sensitive, then to the top of the calf which Ellesandra couldn't reach anyway as it was pressed into the pillow, and resuming on the calf until finally, finally she was kissing parts of Ellesandra that she knew they could kiss back. The torture was slow, but with a clear path that was signalled to give Ellesandra something to focus on, count down in their mind, before finally being allowed to start giving worship to Star's inner thighs, starting from the knee, and up, as Star went down, towards their sex. And then, of course...Skipping over that, to the other thigh, to kiss up along the inner thigh there, going...Noticeably slower, to trigger one last little burst of frustrations as her actions proved so obviously intentional in their denial of what was literally right in front of Ellesandra's face. The heat, the scent, the occasional tremble of her legs and clenching of her petals from any affections Ellesandra provided to her legs once allowed...And of course, a few drops of lust dripped from her as attention resumed upon her body that wasn't of her own doing, dropping on Ellesandra's lips or cheeks, depending on how they had their head facing at the time. Though of course, there was plenty of wet arousal to taste on Star's thighs along the way, so despite Star's teasing, there was still something for Ellesandra to satisfy themselves upon. It was simply a matter of ensuring that by the time Star finally was licking their clit, Ellesandra was ready to hit at least the same cloud that she did on what was truly her first orgasm of her life. And while some partners might desire that sort of affectionate reciprocation just because that was part of sex, Star did it, all of this, solely out of love. The playfulness, the teasing, had all been in the name of making it as memorable for Ellesandra as it was for her.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra's heart missed a couple of beats at the compliments. She didn't respond, but Star's response to seeing her had gone a long way towards easing some of those anxieties. When Star had touched her hair, smoothing fingers through it, she had to resist the urge to just raise her hips and force Star to touch her where she needed it, prior to Star being ready for that. Mostly, because that would have given her permission, by the rules, to touch Star there too. Shen Star showed that she wasn't going to get right to it, but instead begin kissing and touching down her thighs, she groaned out loud. Not because her thighs were particularly sensitive at all - in fact, the only sensitive place she'd find on Ellesandra's legs after kissing and touching them would be the area just behind her knee, and this was a ticklish sensitive, not an erogenous sensitive - but because it delayed her being able to do anything in response to Star. The fact that Star was literally dripping with arousal onto her made her squirm and by Torm was she about to say fuck it to the rule. She held back, but the desire was mounting more and more, Star doing a surprisingly wonderful job at pushing Ellesandra to the edge of her desire without even having touched her. Perhaps she should have just pushed Star straight into an orgasm earlier, rather than giving her ideas about this? No, she didn't regret what she'd done at all. When Star was finally touching places that Ellesandra could reach, she tried to distract herself with that. Kissing along Star's thighs, licking up one to get the stray wetness from it and then blowing soft cool air onto the wet streak she'd licked to cause a different sensation, before kissing again. Knowing and feeling that Star was literally trembling with need above her in some spots caused every touch that Star made seem even more torturous to her, as she got closer to the heat between Ellesandra's thighs. Similar to Star, Ellesandra was dripping with arousal. Her own lips were flexing constantly, matched by her thighs flexing, as if trying to cause their own friction and sensation, to flex and relax the muscles to make it easier to hold off on being touched, but it was getting harder with each moment. Her hips were pressing down into the bed now, since pressing down was action even if what she wanted to do was to press up into Star. And even if Star was doing it out of love, there was more than just love experienced here. There was the lustful desire, even if it was felt alongside the more intimate, romantic feeling behind it. Ellesandra wanted to cum to Star, not just because of that lust but because she wanted to experience that high with Star, at the same time. She enjoyed bringing Star to that point not just because she got satisfaction from pleasing a partner, but she wanted to experience the joy and satisfaction Star had there - to share that experience with her. It was a new addition to this experience for Ellesandra, and it made her restless, impatient compared to how she might normally be. And even if most of her anxiety had been dealt with in regards to their sexual interactions right now, there was still some that was a little afraid she wasn't doing this right for Star.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star still focused more on the intimacy, the romance, the tenderness. That hadn't changed. But sex still involved that physical component, and connecting the physical and emotional was what Star aimed to do, so that Ellesandra was not just getting off, but that it all meant something to both of them as they mutually serviced each other. She also made a mental note that she could tickle Ellesandra near the knee. For a more playful time, that was being saved in her back pocket. For now, joy and satisfaction were the goal. Star could tell she was pushing Ellesandra to the edge, but she also wanted to ensure that she was bringing them as far to the edge as she safely could without making the frustration unpleasant. And, well, she herself was still aroused as all hells, so the justifications for just diving in were plentiful in her heart and mind. Her own legs trembled and quivered when Ellesandra kissed and licked them. She moaned, whimpering and trembling as before. She was only more sensitive in the wake of her orgasm, even if she had been able to cool off from it, so it was going to be that much easier to bring her to her next climax. All this torturing and teasing did have an end in sight, however, and she lowered her hips to be more fully in Ellesandra's face as she concluded her slow journey of kisses, pausing to moan now and again, back down Ellesandra's thigh to finally...Finally arrive at their hot core. Just as Ellesandra did before, Star wasn't just diving at their clit. First, a few kisses to the outer lips, Star clearly having no reservations or hesitations about kissing anywhere on the woman even if it was her first time, and hopefully that eagerness that was free of even a shred of doubts or hesitance in the face of the hair would assure Ellesandra that it truly did not bother her, that Ellesandra was beautiful, that they didn't need to be like her, smooth and shaven, to be so. Of course, there was still hair to contend with for Ellesandra. But it was the hair spilling down from Star's head. It was so long that it just spilled over her butt and dropped down like a curtain to tickle Ellesandra's face. Easily moved out of the way and off her hip of course, but it did still flow over her like the beautiful platinum mane it was, thick and luxurious to touch, and carrying that same floral, breezy scent of Star along with it that would surely be overtaken moments later by the scent of arousal that was so thickly concentrated at her core. Star kissed along Ellesandra's outer lip from beside their clit down to their entrance, then along the other side back towards their clit, but didn't touch their inner sex along the way. She moved her hands to their hips, gripping them with a bit of pressure as she had discovered that Ellesandra liked, then, finally, dove in with her tongue to slowly, tenderly, push into Ellesandra the inch or so that she could, as if passionately kissing the woman's entrance. She groaned as she finally got a taste for the other woman properly, from the source, and felt their heat close around her tongue. She slid her tongue back, then forwards again once or twice in slow, exploratory motions. There was an obvious hunger being sated with this motion, and indeed it just made her leak that much more vigorously in turn for Ellesandra to enjoy as they were given free license to give much desired attention to Star's tight entrance as well. Just lips, or fingers, too? Star hadn't specified really, but she was also a little beyond caring about the technical details of this teasing game she made up on the spot, and was simply bracing to do her best to still focus on Ellesandra when she knew their counter-attack was imminent.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

When Star began to get closer to Ellesandra's core, her breath hitched in anticipation. Anticipation both of being touched, and also being able to touch Star. She began to mirror Star's movements, her kisses up Ellesandra's thigh. These were...pleasant, for Ellesandra, but not erogenous necessarily. She enjoyed her thighs being touched, and specifically rubbed, but she enjoyed them like a back rub, not an arousing, sexual act. So the kissing, while nice, didn't do for her what Star's inner thighs did. What did work for her was when Star took her by the hips again, just before pressing her tongue into Ellesandra. She had been mirroring Star consistently, kissing along Star's outer lips, feeling them tremble against her but not directly pleasuring them. As much as she had wanted to go straight for it, she wanted to do just as Star did. Not only was this an interesting kind of romantic, on the same page type mirror, it was also a good way for Star to see how what she was doing actually felt - at least for her. Everyone was different, so it wouldn't be an exact mirror, but it was close. But when Star finally pressed her tongue into Ellesandra, she had to pause her actions because she'd moaned out loud, her hips pressing up towards Star's mouth to encourage more. Her hands, which had been wrapped around Star's thighs both to move her long hair to the side and also be able to grip Star now that she could, squeezed tighter. She'd considered using her fingers for Star now, since she'd already made Star cum with her mouth, but she was going to follow Star's lead. And since Star was using her mouth, that's how Ellesandra would respond. After the moan, the "Mmm" followed by a silently, breathed out "fuck", Ellesandra pressed the tip of her tongue to Star's entrance as well. She circled the entrance once, then slid inside the few inches she could get, pressing the rest of her mouth directly against Star as she stretched her tongue muscle. Deeper than she'd gotten the first time, since she'd mostly just teased with her tongue then achieved orgasm via clit stimulation, she licked up at the inner wall. Tasting her fully, and that alone sending her close to the edge. She moaned again, the vibration of the sound directly against Star, eyes closed and hands tightening on her. There was a really good chance that Star was going to push her over the edge before Ellesandra could do the same to her, to push Ellesandra into an orgasm that she'd denied herself previously before Star was ready for her second one. Just knowing that they were both pleasuring eachother the same way right now was almost enough to do it for Ellesandra, anyways.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wasn't one to curse much. When she did, it was a real sign something was hitting her hard. But she also knew that Ellesandra expressed themselves with such words often, but only when something was getting past their stoic exterior. So hearing them give that breathy curse shot that little bolt of arousal into Star, only because she knew it meant she was giving Ellesandra something good. She moaned out right in turn, whimpering and needy as the other woman pushed back against her. The use of fingers would certainly have had a small, slightly bloody consequence, so the use of just lips and tongue bypassed all of that and let Star focus on the pleasure. She didn't linger too long on tongue penetration of course; she was still sensitive enough from her earlier orgasm that Ellesandra would feel that just the grinding and kissing had brought her back to a similar hair-trigger. Knowing how close Ellesandra was getting was doing plenty to the auramancer as well, for Ellesandra was not the only one who got off on the pleasures of their partner. Star wanted it. She wanted to feel Ellesandra orgasm. She wanted to do it at the same time, as well. The unity, the romance of it, had her careful with how close she pushed Ellesandra, and was able to leverage her auramancy to ensure she only went as far as edging them while Ellesandra had time to please her in turn and get her ready. In the meantime, she slid her tongue out of them and then gave gently, sweet licks along the length of their inner lips, not yet touching their clit, but just below it as she stroked her tongue along their slit. Then, some little circles around, but not touching, the sensitive, throbbing clit that demanded attention. Teasing, pushing them to the edge without sending them over, while she continued to bask in the sensations and affections bestowed upon her to bring her closer, closer, closer to her second peak. Her body trembled, her back occasionally arched into Ellesandra, her hands made liberal action in squeezing the knight's hips, but now that she knew what led up to an orgasm, she was sure to deny them that until they were both on a hair trigger, which certainly also gave Ellesandra plenty to enjoy in pushing her to the edge as well. Naturally, if Ellesandra was getting off too much to pleasing Star, she would have to settle back into little kisses that were just affectionate and not stimulating to even things out. But then...Once the two of them were trembling, hot messes that were on the brink, did Star lean in to kiss Ellesandra's clit, holding her lips there a moment, before tongue slid from between her lips to begin finally, directly stimulating it in a vaguely similar way to how she felt Ellesandra do to her with her tongue. She was in a bit of the wrong position to plant her open maw over their sex like they had done to her, so she just started with mimicry, then focused on what Ellesandra liked most, and did more of that, switly refining her technique to adapt and do whatever was needed to send Ellesandra over the edge right when she felt her own orgasm coming from the woman stimulating her, so they might ascend to the heights of bliss together, as one.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

It was hard to focus, but focus she did. The only reason she could focus was because she wanted to give this pleasure to Star, enjoyed tasting her, the feel of her on her tongue. Had she used fingers she would have been gentle, to lightly press against the hymen inside rather than stretching it to the point of bleeding. There were ways to make love to a virgin without causing a lot of pain and bleeding, there were just too many impatient guys to do that. But that didn't matter, since right now it was a matter of running her tongue along the inside, and then running it along her lips outside as well. Teasing Star the same way Star was teasing her. There were definite sounds of pleasure from her as she built up close, and closer. They weren't quite so loud as Star's moans had been that first time, but it didn't really take much to come to the conclusion that Ellesandra typically wasn't that loud to begin with. It was a sign of how close she was, how much she was gripping onto Star's thighs or hips, pulling and holding her down on her face. And when Star's trembling began to the point that Star too was on the edge, Ellesandra could hardly hold herself back from pushing her over. The desire to do so immediately was there and her breath brushed out along all of Star's core as she sighed in a satisfaction at pushing her here again, and the frustration of not immediately going for it. Her own lips inner walls were squeezing, thighs tensed and body arching into Star's touch, so so ready for this. When Star finally began to lick at her clit, to run her tongue around it and then stimulating it directly, Ellesandra cried out. Her hips bucked up into Star's mouth, but after the initial cry she immediately returned the same attention to Star's. Well, almost the same. She licked it once, twice, and then brought her head down so that she could focus solely on the clit and sucked it into her lips. A gentle amount of suction, not too strong so as to hurt with how sensitive and aroused Star would be, but just enough to trap it into her lips as she, both uncontrolled and intentionally, moaned her own orgasm onto it, letting the vibrations of her voice along with the stimulation of her tongue hopefully push Star over the edge too. For Ellesandra's part, her orgasm presented a little differently than Star's had. While she had tensed and then shook and trembled and arched into the previous orgasm, Ellesandra's body seemed to want to use every single muscle at once. Her left foot slid to be flat on the bed and pushed into it, using that to push her hips and her core up into Star's mouth more. Her right leg was straight and tensed, toes curled. Her abdomen was flexed outback arched. Hands had begun to dig into Star in a way that, outside of a sexual experience, might normally be considered too rough or harmful. It wasn't enough to cause bruises, and Ellesandra wasn't using nails, but it was definitely a tighter hold than Ellesandra had ever had on Star. Her entire body tensed up and literally shook with the effort of her orgasm, as if somehow her body was resisting it. That wasn't actually what was happening - she fully experienced the pleasure of the orgasm, and was plenty wet from the results of it as she bucked into Star's mouth for more and more of that stimulation - but it matched her typical 'brace against strong emotions and sensations' mindset. Because that's what her entire body was doing - bracing into the orgasm.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star might have found it all so interesting how different Ellesandra's orgasm was if she wasn't busy gushing on Ellesandra's face. Sure, she'd think on it and digest that nuance later, but for the moment she was busy moaning, arcing her back, trembling from head to toe, and trying desperately to do all that while still licking and swirling her tongue on Ellesandra's clit to help them ride their orgasm as long as possible. Their hips bucking up was helpful, as it let her back arch while still being mouth-to-clit on Ellesandra. But this certainly would prove that Star being a bit of a messy girl was not just a fluke or one-time thing, and this time Ellesandra was below them so gravity would ensure that that which did not flow into Ellesandra's lips was going to flow down onto their cheeks, possibly also neck depending on how much Ellesandra caught. And through this, their shared orgasms did work in causing a wonderful feedback loop with one another. Star's orgasm was felt by Ellesandra, whose orgasm was encouraged to be more intense from that, which made it more intense to feel for Star, which made hers stronger to feed back into Ellesandra, and on and on in that lightning-fast circle until both of them hit their peaks of pleasure and the final JOLT of it shot through them both and left Star trembling twice as hard as she had been before, a combination of enduring a second orgasm and this one being stronger, with an accompanying moan loud enough that...Other people in the tavern, given all of them had sensitive ears, were very likely overhearing her. Future embarrassment was the price to pay for such a beautiful, fulfilling moan rising from Star's chest and out for Ellesandra to hear. An affirmation that yes, Ellesandra made her feel incredible. Further affirmation came as Star very much went limp on top of Ellesandra, aftershocks causing shudders as she lay on the woman below her, chest heaving as she came down from that, not a single coherent thought able to focus in her mind until she realized she was...still laying on Ellesandra, and they might want to not have her be doing that. She summoned what little strength she had left to roll off Ellesandra, then lazily turn herself around so she could lay on Ellesandra's left side, climb up, and lay her head on their shoulder, eyes closed, still panting, with one arm stretching across them to cuddle up against their side. She'd obviously not complain if they turned to meet her and cuddle, but for now all she could focus on was just not squishing the knight - even if she was far too light to actually do so - and her immense need for tender aftercare.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra hadn't expected either the feedback loop, OR how strongly Star had orgasmed. Even without the feedback loop, just feeling that Star was literally gushing on her was enough to push her pleasure to greater heights. Having a messy partner was...bliss for Ellesandra. It not only fed her desire and enjoyment of tasting her partner, but it was also a physical, unmissable measurement of how much her partner was enjoying what she did. A physical sign that could not be ignored, or misinterpreted. Someone squirting or gushing was the epitome of what Ellesandra wanted when pleasuring her partner. So this alone sent enough satisfaction and pleasure through her to push her orgasm to greater heights. Now, add on that there was this feedback loop. That she could feel Star's pleasure, and how it was increasing. Even if she felt it as Star's pleasure, separate from her own, that was a lot for someone who thrived in a sexual encounter by giving pleasure, rather than receiving. She peaked to the point that she made up for that previous orgasm she'd held back, pushing her into a second orgasm as she arched into Star. At this point, she'd broken her sucking on Star's clit, head thrown back against the bed and groaning out loud. It wasn't quite a 'moan' like Star was doing, but more her body just...making noise as the tension build up in all of her muscles. She held herself up, and then collapsed to the ground with Star atop her. All of that tension just left her muscles quickly, making her feel...empty, energy wise. Like someone had literally sucked the energy out of her muscles, with how much strength she'd used tensing herself. Her vision was...white. Just completely blank, not actually taking any any visual cues as her chest heaved to bring in breaths. Throughout all of that, other than her groans, she hadn't actually breathed. Now, her body was screaming at her from the soreness of her muscles, and the lack of air. She felt Star turn, and then move to cuddle against her left side. It took a few moments for her to breathe in and deep enough to actually start taking more in again, her ears - they had been ringing? She didn't even realize at the moment, but now that they weren't ringing anymore, the silence seemed odd. The intensity of that orgasm had made Ellesandra herself look like a gusher, even though she normally wasn't. And she still felt some of Star's cum on her face, dripping down her cheeks, coating her lips. She raised her right hand to lightly brush it off of her cheeks, then suck the fingers, eyes closing. Pleasure, at the taste of Star. And then turning, directly cuddling Star back. Her body still shook a little, the exertion of the orgasms more than it was used to, but that didn't stop her from running her fingers along Star's cheek, to pull her hair back and look at her. "You..." She said, deep breathing, then continued. "Okay?" This time, she had a smirk on her face, knowing how ridiculous the question was. Kind of making fun of herself asking that previously.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was trembling against Ellesandra. Hazy, and exhausted. One orgasm had been enough to knock her out, so two? Yeah, it was bed time. Which was fortunate, because it got her to feed a bit more of Ellesandra's medicine to them. Wanna talk about why you can still see Star's aura? Wanna talk about why Star suddenly had wings for a second there, crystalline and ethereal? Too bad! Because Star gave a sleepy nod, then more or less passed out on Ellesandra's chest. She could be roused, sure, but surely these things could all wait until morning. Star also for once felt it was prooooobably for the best that the two of them not acknowledge too heavily that Star had confessed to Ellesandra during. She felt it was mutual, that was enough for her. She didn't need Ellesandra sitting her down and wagging a finger in her face saying it was a mistake or how she definitely didn't know her own emotions, because that would require she be like, an expert in emotions or something. Like an auramancer. Which she definitely wasn't and therefore it made perfect sense for her to be mistaken about what she felt. Alllll of these frustrations were miles away from Star as she drift away into a sweet slumber, happily cuddling as close to Ellesandra as she could to get some much needed rest, and just enjoy some happy dreams that were probably going to feature the two of them together, naked, to some degree. Loving, not horny dreams were on her menu. And on the menu for Ellesandra when they did go to bed? That pull to lucidity again as they were planted in the realm of decision. The white and gold-handled door to Sapphire. The black and red-handled door to Valentina. The void beyond to go to dreamland. Or, a new addition, the card singing with energy in Ellesandra's legging or pocket, wherever it was normally kept with them. Whether Ellesandra was in their armor or plain clothes was entirely up to their own desire, what they wanted themselves to be in. Now back outside of Myst, this would be the norm going forward unless something changed. The choice of whether to dream, or to address one of the now three paths their unconsciousness could take.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt Star's weakness. Her tiredness. And how she needed to sleep, after the strong orgasms. Ellesandra very much needed the same, but as Star began to drift off she repositioned the auramancer against her so Star would be more comfortable. She combed her hair back lightly, out of her face, and then pulled her arm around Ellesandra's waist. Fingers lightly, if still shakily, brushed against Star's sleeping cheek. There was such softness in her gaze right now, if Star was awake she would be loving the tenderness that Ellesandra was showing her. The love. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Star's forehead, before pulling back and laying her head back down against the bed. Her breathing slowly calmed, and her eyes shut. She awkwardly grabbed what she could of the covers and threw them over the both of them, not moving too much to do so and just doing what she could. And then she rested one hand on Star's arm across her, and the other around Star's shoulder as she lay up against her, the left hand lightly caressing the small of Star's back and her lower hip. Not sexual, just...mindless touching, as Ellesandra drifted into sleep. When she fell into that dream scape, with the two doors, Ellesandra sighed. Of course she was back to having this again. With the night she'd just had, she didn't really want to talk to any of them. She didn't really want to dream, either. She just wanted to sleep, hold Star, and wake up tomorrow to maybe a few light kisses and then seeing what the day had for them. The card feeling like it was burning with energy drew her attention, though. She pulled it out, staring at it for a moment. It was back to closer to the middle, not pushed towards the side of defeat like it had originally been. She clenched her teeth, considering. The memory of that last dream, where she'd fought herself, sat uneasy in her. While the fight had been a nice thing to dream, the rest had been not as great. So she put the card away again. Her focused then turned back to the two doors in front of her. She'd already spoken to Valentina that day - even if the day seemed really long. Should she talk to Sapphire? Was there anything to talk about? She knew about Sapphire's past now, and knew her relationship to Valentina, but there wasn't exactly anything that could do for her was there? Potentially, Sapphire could give her some guidance on how to handle Valentina. With a sigh, she approached Sapphire's door. She knocked on it - probably unnecessary, but she didn't want to walk in on Sapphire fucking someone - and then opened the door to step through, looking around. "Sapphic?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The door opened from the knock, revealing the same sanctuary Sapphire had been in the last time Ellesandra was here. The waterfall falling into the circular pond below. The beautiful flowers all around. It sort of looked familiar, like something Ellesandra had seen recently, but the focus on that might be minimal as Sapphire responded. She smiled at Ellesandra from her place seated at the water's edge, back to the water and brilliant white wings spread behind her. She waved them in, happily accepting their presence to come join her. "Long time no chat, Ellesandra," she said pleasantly. Sapphire being an angel certainly did lend to how warm and inviting she was, even if the topics were regularly unpleasant. "How are you faring on this night?" A question posed genuinely, because Sapphire remained blissfully ignorant to all that Ellesandra did in private with Star, as it rightly should and would indeed remain.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took a step in, closing the seat behind her, and eyed Sapphire and where the water was. She didn't approach, trying to make it clear she wasn't here just for a friendly chat by the waterfall or anything like that. While meeting Sapphire in normal circumstances may have led to them being something akin to friends, the circumstances in which they actually met still put a large barrier between them for that. Sapphire was, at best, an ally. At worst, an enemy of her enemy. Though based on the vision she got from Valentina, she wasn't quite so sure of that anymore. She crossed her arms, eyeing Sapphire and where the necklace used to lay on her neck, but she didn't comment on that. "We're in Gurhal, now. Star, myself, Amelia and Amara. Or at least I assume they made it back, if not they'll probably be back first thing tomorrow." Ellesandra had been just a little distracted of checking in on them that evening. "And as such, I suspect we're going to be running into Valentina's minions and captains more." A drop that she knew Black Diamond's name now. This would be a development since Sapphire last spoken to her. "Just curious if you could shed any light on potentially facing them, or avoiding them. I'd rather avoid them entirely, but understanding that's not possible, I'd rather not be surprised and accidentally magically draw a curse into myself again when trying to put down a magic suit of armor." And another drop. Obviously, lots had happened since she last spoke to the angel.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sapphire hadn't been expecting them to come out swinging with that information, but she also wasn't fazed by it. Sapphire might be easy to look at, sweet, gentle, and a lot of things of that nature, but behind those eyes was the spirit of a very powerful woman, a woman who regularly held life and death in the balance for countless around her, and thus could not afford to ever be shaken. So. She smiled. "I'm glad you made it," she said tenderly. "If you ever make your way to Hotenz city, I might be able to have someone show you around. That's where I was born," she said, then briefly looked to the sky above. It was a beautiful night sky, of course, in this dreamscape. She looked back to them, again. "You're correct that Valentina will retaliate. In no small measure. When it comes to fighting them, well.." she briefly looked at the ground between them. "Avoid fighting her thralls if at all possible. You will die. You aren't strong enough to face them in direct conflict. But...Understand that Valentina doesn't want to kill you, any of you, either." She took a moment to consider her words, then looked back at Ellesandra. "Some would find it easiest to be described as there being two Valentinas. One who does the awful, unforgiveable, inexcusable things, the other who wants to help, to heal, to be at peace and to love all those around her. And those two are constantly at war with one another. It changes little about what actually happens, of course. But it might help you understand her mindset more." She paused again with another smile. "Remember Lissana? I'm sure that all felt very rightly threatening and exigent. And to some degree, it was. But I'm curious how much you'd reject the notion that it was only ever meant to...Appear awful. That Lissana was kidnapped and traumatized by that itself is true, yes. None will argue otherwise that it was, in itself, a horrible thing to do. But while Lissana could certainly have been more comfortable, the woman wasn't ever in danger of the atrocious things you'd think someone in her position would be subject to." One more pause, then a deep breath. "This is all to say that...To answer your question, the best way to fight Valentina is to understand her. Know when you can appeal to her good side...When your calls for mercy will be answered...And what steps over the line, and will evoke reprisal. I have...Concerns that what has already transpired will be met with a show of force. So...Knowing what you've told me, I will keep an eye on Neet, and do what I can to support you and your allies. As true as it is that Valentina could, at any time, kill all of you...She also knows that I am watching over you and your group. And while it is my desire to not interfere in yours or any of the lives of those around you...I'm sure you've appreciated the utility of the shadow-sense I've blessed you with. Best to keep that a secret from Valentina as best you can," she said, smiling, then winking once.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The comment of Hotenz city again made her shrug. It wasn't on the active destination list. It had been where they'd planned to teleport, but now that they were across the planes from it, it was a 'if something else comes up needed in there' moment. She'd keep that in mind, though. At the, basically, confirmation that they'd die fighting them, she shook her head. "I don't understand. Star and I together already took out one of them, or what he not really a captain?" Though, to be fair, the captain had very nearly killed Ellesandra. And if he was the weakest, the others surely would. But now Amara and Amelia were there, along with others potentially. Sapphire's explanation of there being two Valentina's was waved off, disregarded. She didn't care what excuses Sapphire made for Valentina, the person she'd used to love, to not hate her like this. But the mention of Lissana, and her not actually being in danger, sent a spark of fury through Ellesandra. Not only this, but to hear that Sapphire knew where they were - she'd never told Sapphire yet they were in Neet - and also had been the one to 'bless' her with the gift of sensing the shadows, she growled and waved her hand angrily. "Oh for fucks sakes you two are worse than deities yourselves. At least deities will look other deities in the face and spit at eachother to fight their wars, not bringing lowly mortals like us into it constantly." There was obvious irritation at being forcibly involved into the web of plans these two people had. Well, that Star was being forcibly involved, because if Star was involved she was. "So your suggestion is don't fight them and if I do try to find the right time to appeal to her 'nice' side? Oh please don't kill me miss Valentina I promise I won't try to break the curse again?" The sarcasm absolutely dripped off of her tone and she huffed. She didn't turn down the assistance, per say, but just expressed frustration at having little choice in the matter. "I already know Valentina could kill us with a wave of her hand if she wants to. She did, and somehow brought me back immediately after. If she wanted us dead we'd be dead. But it still stands that she's going to stand in our way for our mission, and considering Aurora is actively being held captive by her people, I don't think avoiding her forever will be possible, my ability to sense them or not. I'm not exactly the quietest person walking around in my armor either. So, should we just plan to wage an all out war? Because that sounds very not ideal."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sapphire gave a sympathetic expression. "He might as well have just been a zombie. The trio of Blood Onyx - Sylvia, Blood Emerald - Calypso, and Red Opal - Willow, are her actual lieutenants. Her direct reports. The ones who carry out her will, with a great deal of latitude. Willow is unique among them; Sylvia and Calypso were formed from souls of the damned, given solid form in hateful necromancy to give life to a formless shell. Willow was...Is...Human. Of the three, Willow will be the one you could actually kill, if you had to. Willow is the name of the one who remains invisible. A tracker. It's hard to know if Valentina knows that you and Star can both see her but...Willow doesn't like being seen. It may drive her to acts of violence if you expose her. She can often be trusted to be passive otherwise," she explained, hopeful that actual advice would land a bit better than what had clearly been upsetting for Ellesandra to hear. "The gems that Valentina used on the captain you killed was how she resurrects the dead. But doing so strips them of who they are, and makes them her puppet. You'll surely find more of them who are just...Low-level peons for her. Those, you should be able to kill, but do not underestimate them all the same. As for my suggestion, well. I wouldn't phrase it quite like that. I would sooner say that if you were to ever assert to Valentina that she doesn't want to kill you, it might very well be what stays her hand. Because it is the truth. She is just too corrupted by the curse now, and too far gone under the weight of her own atrocities to fully stop until her curse is lifted." An assertion that suggested Sapphire believed the curse could be broken, despite Valentina's assertion that it was impossible. "Waging an all out war is not what I would advise. It is a war you would lose. Even if you manage to free Aurora with force, it wouldn't end there. You cannot kill her. Nobody can. Not even herself." She drew in a soft breath. "The only way you get peace at the end of all this is first by understanding the 'why' of it all, so that when you do free Aurora, and I do believe you will...That Valentina turns her attentions elsewhere and your victory is enough fire for her kind, loving side to convince herself that it doesn't matter, and she'll find some other way. If it might ever help, I could tell you about how this exact strategy has worked in the past, with the Tsukino family, and how it saved a girl named Sophia Lee, as well as reunited a family of moon sorceresses. But, perhaps a story for another time. It's quite the tale."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra did note the information provided. The names, Sylvia and Calpyso, and Willow. How Willow was an actual human, and didn't like being seen - thus being invisible most of the time. And how exposing her might piss her off. She would keep in mind to share that bit of information with Star later. The information about the gems and the captain just solidified that Valentina was a shit person. This wasn't a situation where she just gave magic to a shit person - she was actively ordering an in charge of said peon shit person. It was good to know her apparent shadow sense blessing would work on them too though, at least, if not their active subordinates if there was a situation similar to the pirates. "So what you're saying is we appeal to Valentina's good side and say oh our love and devotion has been enough to make this fight not worth it for her. Or, alternatively and the one I think is the better more likely option, we break that damned curse." She paused. "It destroyed my sword when I tried last time I met her, or she did I'm not entirely sure. Can't say I'm surprised though, if me stabbing it could have broken it she probably would have broken it millennia ago herself." She reached up, scratching at the back of her head and shaking it. "Star might be able to convince her to look the other way, but me? I'd be more likely to cause her to throw me on a pit of spikes again -" though Ellesandra WOULD be more careful of that from now on - "Yet Valentina said in no uncertain terms that either aurora or Star seeing her would drive them to madness. And I believe that part. So I can't really let Star speak to her, can I?" Frustration. The tale would potentially be one to have now, or later depending on how time actually worked in this realm. She wasn't sure.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sapphire stood up at this point, looking at Ellesandra with a tiny bit of pride, but the kind of pride that was garnished with a hint of temperance. The sort that said Ellesandra's heart was in the right place, at least. "Then we're in agreement about what needs to be done but...As you say, it's a little more complicated than just...Jamming a sword into the necklace. The physical housing of the curse is just that - even if you did manage to break it, it would just move to another vessel. Curses of this magnitude are as frustratingly complex as they are powerful. So my advice to understand her and the lines she will not cross is not because I don't agree that breaking her curse isn't the superior solution - it is. But the fact remains that the person who knows best how the curse could be broken is the one who is cursed by it. It isn't a matter of just brute force, I'm afraid. If it was just a matter of having sufficient magical strength, I could have found a way by now. But, frustratingly, it's better to think it a puzzle than a lock. Smashing it open won't work. And I have no reason to believe Valentina would just break your sword, so it's safe to assume that was the curse's doing. It'd have done a lot worse to you if it afflicted you, rather than the sword. And as to how it would affect Star? I believe it as well. And if you keep in mind that she does not want to kill Star? Then that is one line she will not cross. She won't appear before you, if Star is with you. Use that knowledge to your advantage. And should you ever feel Star is at risk, and I might be wrong, well...As brutal as it sounds, having some method of magically putting Star to sleep in an emergency may be wise to have on hand. Unconsciousness will be the only thing to save her, if worst came to worst and I am wrong. I'd never dare hinge someone's life or sanity on such advice, even if I do remain confident in my assertion." Sapphire wasn't going to suggest it, but in an absolute worst case, physically knocking Star unconscious to save their life was a last resort, but one that might come to be required if indeed her belief that Valentina would never cross that line was misguided. Before she could continue, however, Sapphire looked troubled, and moved a hand to her temple, pressing into it with the pads of her fingers. "Nn...No, something's wrong. No..." Sapphire was looking down between them as she focused on this. She then went wide-eyed, and looked at Ellesandra. "Ellesandra. Go. Now. You have to wake up," she said, flicking her hand at the door behind them to force it to throw open. "I don't have time to explain - you telling me you've arrived made me focus on your location, and now that I am I see shadows have descended upon Neet; you and Star are under a sleep spell, you will have to fight that to wake up. You have to wake up and buy me time. DO NOT. WAKE. STAR. GO. Out the door, and wake up! NOW!" And if Ellesandra listened to these grave and dire words, rushing out the door would indeed bring them back to wakefulness, wakefulness that had an oppressive magic weighing down on Ellesandra, trying to get them to stay asleep. Their magical resistance fought it, and fed on the mana. The magic was contained only to the room Ellesandra and Star were in, made clear by a wavy, hazy magic that lined the walls, ceiling, and floor. It would blur Ellesandra's vision and make them drowsy, but could not overcome their magical resistance. Star, meanwhile, would not wake from being roused because of the magic. There was also an ominous red moonlight pouring in from the window..
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded, listening to the description of the curse. She remembered Valentina trying to puzzle the curse out when trying to break it, and how complex it had been in that memory. It was definitely out of her wheel house, but it didn't mean she couldn't try to find something else to work for that instead. Her own form of curse breaking was essentially just siphoning the curse into herself and then out into a different item. It was also noted that if she sensed or noticed Valentina around, knocking Star out was a valid option. Star would forgive her, probably, eventually, once Ellesandra explained why. She also hoped that Sapphic was right about Valentina not showing up when Star was there, since her planning to be around Star at all times meant the chances of her having to actually try to fight Valentina low. Which was good, since Ellesandra held absolutely no delusion that she could actually take Valentina. Didn't mean she wouldn't try if push came to shove, but she'd try knowing it was certain death. However, when Sapphic immediately switched postures, staring down at the ground between them and with alarm in her voice, Ellesandra didn't hesitate to follow her instructions. The not waking Star bothered her a little - if Star was in danger, why not wake her? - but she decided just as she was turning and going back out of the door to put her trust in Sapphire. She might later regret it, but in a situation like this she had to make the choice in the moment, and she was putting her faith in that. So when she woke up, no doubt tangled up into cuddles with Star, she felt the magic weight down on her - and empowering her at the same time. She pulled back form Star, the only part in which she went slowly so that she didn't wake Star with her jerky movements panicked behavior. Ellesandra didn't know what it was for, and something sat wrong with her in leaving Star here, asleep. But at the same time, she'd chosen to trust Sapphire, so trust her she would. With that, she grabbed her rapier, slipping it out of it's sheathe and stepped towards the door. She paused on the way, grabbing the pants that had been pulled off that night at the end of the bed and grabbing the coin that communicated with Amelia. "Amelia, the fuck is going on? Are you okay?" She was already in the process of opening the door and slipping out, zero care in the world that she was nude. She would have loved to be able to put her armor on, but there was a good chance that she wouldn't have time for that based on how Sapphire responded. And along with this message, she was putting Sapphire's 'blessing' to use, trying to actively search for any shadows and where they were. If there was nothing in the hallway and she was able to feel one, she'd start heading towards the closest one, hair a mess behind her and obviously sex-stained dry thighs available for, well. Surely people had heard them last night anyways, right?
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star remained entirely lost in slumber. She was in a deep sleep, deeper than what was natural. Even bumping her a little might not wake her, and even if she did wake, it would take consistent rousing to keep her from falling back to sleep. So she kept sleeping, a small tingle of anxiety pulsing from her when she felt Ellesandra leave. Even sleeping, she was aware of the knight while they were close. But that faded as Ellesandra moved away. If not for the spell on her, she might have woken from that. Ellesandra would still be able to see Star's aura, and see that she was content, if a bit anxious now. Her dreams might turn a bit more frightful or sad because of the separation, but there were more important things than her dreams at the moment. First, Ellesandra's attempt to reach out to Amelia with the sending coin. The response? A shrill, loud ringing in Ellesandra's ears. Not painful, but disorienting for a moment. Some magical fuckery was afoot, blocking the magic from doing what it should. It only lasted a few seconds, then faded. With that, Ellesandra's foray into the hall of the tavern leading back to the main room was...Quiet. Eerily so. It was the sort of quiet that was only ever experienced after a snowfall. The lack of the ambient noise in the surroundings. Deafeningly quiet, such that Ellesandra's footsteps on the floorboards were especially loud when one creaked. The shadow-sense did as it always did, revealing the presence of the Blood Onyx - Sylvia - out in the central part of Neet where the crossed roads that split the settlement divided it into its four quadrants; it revealed as well that the Red Opal - Willow - was with them. Arriving in the main room of the tavern would see a familiar face - Ricca. Except...She was folded over the bartop. Blood was leaking out of her ears and eyes and mouth. A harrowing sight, certainly, to see the innocent girl with hair matted with streaks of red and face stained with the streaks of crimson leading to a small pool of blood on the counter. There was motion in her figure. Slight, bare motion. The sight of her chest motion indicated shallow breaths, but inspecting her would reveal her to be barely alive. A weak pulse. And magic...Vile, horrid magic hung in the air. Red moonlight poured in through the windows at the front of the tavern as well, and walking out, Ellesandra would see flakes of pale red ash falling from the sky. It covered the ground like a snowfall, to about ankle height. And stepping out into the street would reveal more bodies laying in the ash. The innocent fox-people of Neet who had come out in the dead of night, perhaps to examine the curious goings-on now lay in their night clothes, face down, bleeding from the ears and eyes and mouths as Ricca was. Dead, void expressions upon their faces, just as Ricca's. No awareness. No consciousness. The magic that hung in the air here was different than what was in the room with Star, but was very much not affecting Ellesandra, and thus was not able to be absorbed by their magic. Looking towards the center of the settlement, a vile red crystal had been erected, jutting out of the ground, jagged and splintered, and was radiating the magic through the settlement. Relative to it, Sylvia was standing nearby, looking around. Willow was on the opposite side of the crystal, cloaked as always. And in the air clung the thick, metallic scent of blood that filled Ellesandra's nostrils with every breath. It remained the dead of night, perhaps an hour or three after Ellesandra went to bed. Sunrise would be in a few hours. But Ellesandra's only direction had just been to...buy time, whatever that meant.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra winced when the magic of the coin just gave her an ear splitting noise. She cursed under her breath as she walked down the hallway, then down into the main area. Seeing Ricca slumped over the bar, she took a moment to glance around to ensure there were no active threats in the room itself then moved quickly over to Ricca. A hand on her back, head tilted to check on her. Alive, but weak - and obviously barely alive. She again felt like following Sapphire's suggestion, to not wake Star, was a mistake. Star could help heal Ricca, and any other villagers that might be hurt too. But she didn't dwell on this. For now, Ricca was alive. She placed the coin down on the bar next to Ricca, in case she happened to wake soon. Whether Ricca would know what the coin was or if it would work she didn't know, but she figured at least leaving the coin with someone who could communicate with Amelia would be better than taking it herself, naked. She'd need her hand free for spells. A glance around found herself a coat, and she slid it on as she made her way to the door. Just enough to cover some of her skin from any of the potential magic she could FEEL around her, even if it wasn't actively effecting her for some reason. As she stepped outside and looked around, the red...ash disturbed her. She didn't take too much time just staring at it, but she looked towards the obvious red crystal. And all of the villagers. There was a pang in her chest, but she pushed it down, ignoring it for now. There was no guarantee if they were dead; Ricca was still alive, after all, and Ellesandra could potentially stop this before it fully killed them. Whatever 'this' was. Her eyes focused in on Sylvia, making her way forward with long, sure steps. To distract, to take up time, Sapphire had said. Buy her time. Ellesandra made no indication she knew Willow was there, but even if Willow wasn't there she was fully aware she probably couldn't take on Sylvia one on one. This big crystal, though - would she be able to survive long enough to try to destroy it? Would she even be able to do that, or would it destroy her rapier like the curse had? She was getting ahead of herself, but her mind was mapping out a potential plan to destroy the crystal, rather than actually trying to fight off Sylvia and Willow. As she approached, she called out. "This seems a little unnecessary, doesn't it? All this death does what for your cause? It's not like these people will somehow help you or deter you from fighting the gods and making them pay." She spoke loud enough to get Sylvia's attention, trying to get them to focus on her - and maybe stop whatever magic, if it was something they had to actively focus on.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sylvia turned when Ellesandra spoke up, having been looking down one of the other streets. She had her scythe in one hand, the same less-than-modest outfit giving little to the imagination about her figure or curves. She stepped forward through the ash, kicking it up with each step as she did. It continued to fall from the sky, landing to dust Ellesandra's hair and their shoulders. "Ellesandra? Now, now...You were supposed to be asleep," she said as she encroached. "You'd best walk back to bed now," she said, looking at what Ellesandra was wearing, noting the lack of shoes, the bare calves she could see under the coat, the bare collar. And it obviously being a man's jacket. "Seems like someone is back there waiting for you, after all. As for the necessity of it? Well. That's not for me to argue. Just to execute. Let this all...Set the stage, as they say. To reinforce that anyone whose lives you touch is as good as dead," said Sylvia with a cocky grin. "It'd obviously be easier to just kill you, but I'm getting the feeling that dear Valentina much prefers the idea of breaking you. How many innocent lives do you think you can bear on your conscience before you give up, I wonder?" She stopped a fair distance away from Ellesandra. She was interposing herself between the knight and the crystal. Not aggressing, but rather, defending. Willow's presence remained unmoving by the crystal.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shrugged at the asleep comment. She hadn't stopped her approach, even as Sylvia began moving towards her as well. At the obvious attempt to stop between Ellesandra and the Crystal, she simply began walking to the side, circling to try to force Sylvia to move if she was planning to stay between her and the crystal. It would be revealing if Sylvia felt it was necessary to do so. It could also just be arrogance if she didn't do so though, so Ellesandra didn't push the possibility out of her mind entirely. Her eyes flicked to the crystal, making sure to focus her sight on the crystal and not where she felt Willow from, then back to Sylvia. On the outside, Sylvia's words looked like they had no effect on her. Like she brushed them off, ignored them. On the inside? Her gut wrenched. All of this, all of the pain and potentially dead townspeople was just to dissuade her from continuing on this path? That...would be a lot that she would need to process later. Or well, to hate herself for. There was plenty of time to go through that when not actively in this situation though, so for now, Ellesandra did what she did best. She took the feeling of guilt and devastation, the grief for these innocent Gurhalians, and shoved it down into a corner of herself, locked away to focus on the current situation. "Obviously less than you are comfortable having on your consciousness killing. Valentina started out as a lovely person, wanting to help others. I get her anger at the gods - and honestly, if it weren't for her methods I might join her in her fight against them. But this?" She waved her right hand towards some of the townspeople, at the ash, while circling. She was trying to get ever so closer, inch by inch, without Sylvia noticing as she circled. Make it easier for her to use haste to get to the crystal before Sylvia could interfere. "Going a little far for my tastes. And I'm sure if she let herself be who she truly is beyond all that suffering, she'd agree." Sapphire HAD said to appeal to them, right? To appeal to Valentina's good side? Ellesandra didn't actually expect this to work, but it was a way to continue conversation and potentially distract Sylvia while Ellesandra came up with a plan.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sylvia matched Ellesandra's motions. They circled, so did she, moving to keep herself in the way. There was only so far one could circle without running into the buildings, though ducking between the buildings to try and elude the other was a possible path. If sticking to the road, there wasn't too much wiggle room. Sylvia also stepped closer with this motion, pushing Ellesandra to a position where they might soon be in striking distance of one another if they kept it up. She was obviously defending the crystal, and obviously could tell what Ellesandra was trying to do. She gave a dry laugh at the other's words. "Please. I don't have a conscience. Having one would just hinder my work," she admitted, clearly having no shame in revealing that she was a remorseless killer. "But listen to you. Do you really expect me to believe you feel any of that? Please. You say you might actually join her in the fight against them, then say this is too far. Well. If this was a town full of criminals, the gods wouldn't give a flying fuck, now would they? And neither would you, probably. But even without a conscience, I can know that doing this? Well. This is something everyone should agree is fucked up. And...Where are the smites from the gods? Hello? Anyone up there?" she asked, then waited a moment, though kept her eyes on Ellesandra, not wanting to give them a chance to take advantage of her being distracted. "...No? No lightning bolts? Huh. Well. Guess they can't care THAT much, can they?" As Sylvia was going on about this, there was a sound from the church. The door opened. Father Copia stumbled out, coughing up blood. He was weak, clearly, but strong enough to resist this, and then took in the horrors before him. "...By Eldath's grace...SCOURGE OF EVIL, WHAT HAVE YOU BROUGHT UPON THIS FLOCK?!" he shouted, and eyes then burned with divine light, which sent a shockwave of divine energy out, kicking up the ash all through the street and forming a cloud all around, engulfing the settlement in an ashen mist that reduced visibility to just a few feet. Of course, Ellesandra could still see the evil two through it, and sense them when not looking towards them. It was as good a chance Ellesandra was going to get, but there remained the clear possibility that this distraction might come at the price of Father Copia's life if Sylvia chose to exact retribution for this interruption.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra accepted Sylvia getting closer. If they wanted her dead, they would have killed her. Sylvia herself had stated that Valentina did NOT want her dead. Did that mean they couldn't still beat the shit out of her and cripple her? No, but they were just outside of striking range. Hopefully enough time to react, if needed. She didn't know how fast Sylvia was, but if she was fighting at a speed equal to an average fighter - no matter how skilled or strong she might be magically - Ellesandra would be able to outpace her and move away. During the pause, when waiting for the lightning bolts, Ellesandra responded. "Oh no, the gods don't give a shit about anyone, criminal or not. I agree with you there. But the thing is - I do. And that's what makes us better than them." She winced when she heard Father Copia come out of the church and shout. There was an internal cringe and wish he'd have just stayed inside and tried to get through this magical ailment or leaching or whatever was happening. She wasn't about to not use the distraction he so kindly gave to her advantage, though. As soon as she realized the dust had picked up and blocked off most sight, she made the signs with her right hand to cast haste. A light golden glow spread around her, kicking the magic into full gear. She had some extra magic from what she'd absorbed of the sleep spell, as well as anything left over from the aura empowerment she'd had with Star if that was still there from earlier that night, but going full force haste would still take a toll on her body quickly, either way. Ellesandra moved quickly, pushing her body to it's limits for this. She would attempt to move around Sylvia, but do so in a way that she could slice out with the tip of her rapier at the back of one of Sylvia's knees. Rapiers were not typically slashing weapons, but if someone skilled knew how to use the very tip of the blade to do so, it could be. And she'd assume Sylvia was like the captain, where pain wouldn't exactly matter, but no matter if you could ignore pain you couldn't exactly run if your tendons were cut. The muscles just wouldn't work....right? That was her goal, to stop Sylvia from being able to get to the Father that way, but either way it wasn't her main goal. It was a strike as she moved, straight towards the shadow of Willow since she knew that the crystal was between them.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sylvia had turned in the midst of the mist, ready to charge at the fox-man and cleave him in twain. Which just set her up to be perfectly struck by Ellesandra, who would find the lingering mana was there, and Star's presence still within them. There was a surprising amount of strength in that spark of Star inside them. Ellesandra's haste would exceed anything they had done with it before in their life, able to run faster, move more fluidly, and react with more speed and precision than ever. It wasn't on part with that invincible feeling Ellesandra had experienced before, but it was a taste of it. A small drop of that same power. This had been what Star had been speaking of as tactical benefit to empowering their resonance, certainly. Ellesandra was magically stronger, now. Not enough to go toe to toe with Sylvia, but it was definitely noticeable. Star's magic lingering in them also seemed to fight hard against the toll it took on Ellesandra's muscles. It wasn't eliminating it, and pushing this hard was still going to plant them on their ass when it was done, but it meant that Ellesandra could sustain it longer, with lesser repercussion. Sylvia's legs were open targets, and the swift slashes with the tip of their rapier was enough to drop Sylvia to her knees. "BITCH!" she shouted, which was likely such a sweet sound for the knight to hear. It then allowed Ellesandra a clear path to the crystal while Sylvia recovered. She would be up in just a few seconds, so Ellesandra had but a small window to react before finding out how fast Sylvia was.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Okay, hearing Sylvia shout Bitch at her was definitely a pleasant thing to hear. And the feel of power and increased speed in her was even better. She'd have to thank Star later, if she made it through this without devastation. Her left hand flicked again, making arcane symbols as she stepped up to about where the crystal would be. She was guestimating now, since the dust made it impossible to see it super well, but she COULD see Willow, and she knew about where it was in relation to them. The blue light coated her rapier, the ice magic within hopefully being used if needed as well, to pierce directly into the core of the Crystal. If the piercing worked, and her blade didn't just explode like the last time she tried to pierce something, Ellesandra didn't stop moving. She used the momentum of her speed and the strike to toss herself up, flipping over the Rapier within the crystal and planting her feet onto the crystal itself. She yanked, ripping the weapon back out of the crystal and using this motion, like a front flip, to propel herself up and over the crystal. It almost looked like a circus act, but - well, Ellesandra was wearing a heavy coat and nothing else, plus she was not a circus performer. She may be acrobatic, but this might be a bit much for her. She aimed her feet to just so happen to land right around where Willow's chest would be, her eyes focused past Willow and in the direction of the father's voice though. Trying to play this off as coincidence as much as absolutely possible.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra's flipping would prove successful, and impressively so. The top of the crystal had jagged, frayed spikes that required careful footwork to avoid, but Ellesandra's haste and acrobatic adeptness had them up for the task. Sylvia was up on her feet again, fighting through the injury, and was about to lunge after Ellesandra, but with them flipping around like a circus monkey she ended up losing them in the dust, and would have to circle around to find them. The shadowy presence of Willow did not stand idle as Ellesandra nearly landed on them. They zipped away, so fast it might have been a teleportation. But with that series of actions? Likely not intentional, but the crystal began to crack all around it, growing more and more fractured by the second. A build-up of mana was tangible in the air around it, until it proved to be too much and the crystal vaporized in a potent explosion, sending red dust out from all around it that shot out in all directions from where it once stood, and certainly blowing Ellesandra, as well as Sylvia and the Father, off their feet from the shockwave. Disorienting and dazing, but not enough to break bones. Maybe some ringing in the mind, though Ellesandra's haste if still active would keep them sharp and alert. The ash dispersed from the force, clearing the air and revealing that Sylvia and Father Copia had been knocked down as well. Sylvia, on her side. Father Copia, onto his back, unconscious. The evil mana in the air, what was presumably killing everyone, was now gone. Sylvia scrambled to her feet, looking at the destroyed crystal. "Fuck's sake.." she muttered. "Well. Guess I gotta kill 'em by hand then, don't I?" she said, an obvious threat to Ellesandra as she began walking towards the unconscious Father Copia, scythe spinning in hand to be held midway along the shaft, the blade pointed up on a diagonal, in a prime position for an overhand swing that she surely would carry out if she got close to the priest.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was a little pleased in that she'd completed that successfully. She hadn't actually expected that to work so well. She'd gotten Willow to go off somewhere away from them for now, and the crystal had been destroyed. Of course being knocked on her ass by the shockwave of the crystal breaking hadn't exactly been pleasant, but she'd survive if that was the worst she got from it. The haste was still on, the benefit of it being on when getting hit like that meant as long as the attack wasn't too disorienting - like that of when her mind was taken over by the curse - then it was relatively easy to concentrate on the spell. So she was able to get up quickly, eyeing Father Copia unconscious, and then Sylvia moving to get up. "Well, fuck." She muttered to herself in response to Sylvia deciding to just kill them all by hand then. Ellesandra couldn't prevent both Sylvia and Willow from just going around and doing what they will, but maybe she could distract Sylvia from it and hope Willow decided to watch or to just do nothing? Unlikely, but it was better than just sitting here while Sylvia went for the Father. And though she was tempted to just put herself between Sylvia and the Father, that would make it all to easy for Sylvia to force Ellesandra to make the decision of taking a hit, or having the hit kill him. While Ellesandra would always take the hit in that situation, there was a voice in the back of her mind reminding her that she'd promised Star no death, if she could control it. Sacrificing herself here wouldn't do anything good. And so, Ellesandra chose to directly engage Sylvia in a fight. Far outmatched, but Sapphire had just said to buy time, right? Ellesandra was putting faith that she could maybe survive against Sylvia long enough for that time to happen. The haste would help, but she made a quick sign with her hands to cast her enhanced defense on herself as well. She had no armor, and though this was mostly aimed towards protecting against magical attacks, Ellesandra had no idea how Sylvia fought. She had a scythe, but that didn't mean she didn't also use magic. And so, Ellesandra lunged towards Sylvia. She aimed towards the gem, her heart. She had no expectation of landing the blow, but she needed Sylvia to turn to her and take her attack seriously. If Sylvia felt she could just take a stab and kill the father anyways, she had no reason to turn to Ellesandra. But with Ellesandra being on the side, trying to pull Sylvia's attention away from the unconscious man, she wanted Sylvia to turn towards her. To engage in combat. And so as she stabbed, she growled out. "Start with me then, you sad reaper wannabe."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sylvia walked with a slow pace towards Father Copia. Walked with an arrogance of invincibility that was to be expected of someone like her. But it did mean there was plenty of time for Ellesandra to be annoying about it. Sylvia saw their attack coming, and did in fact treat it with the seriousness a strike like that ought to be given. However, Sylvia deftly dodged the strike with a turn of her body that saw the rapier striking air right at the last moment. She was fast. Extremely so. The wind rushing from her movement was easily felt. And with this twirl came a spin of her scythe that saw not the blade, but the blunt metal face opposite the blade swinging at Ellesandra, flying at their side to strike the woman and certainly cause them to fall off balance from the strike alone, sent with great force to the side, though not clear off their feet. A strike around the kidney that would certainly ache once the adrenaline wore off and would leave a nasty bruise, but very much proving that she wasn't going to be killing Ellesandra. Sylvia then turned to face the knight as they likely recovered from the counterattack. She changed her posture such that she was holding her scythe before her, in both hands. "As you wish, you failure of a guardswoman." Ellesandra's shadow sense allowed them to sense that Willow was nearby, but jumping around at a rapid pace across rooftops until stopping on one of the rooftops that overlooked the other two from behind Ellesandra. A potential pincer attack, though Sylvia's eyes remained fixed on Ellesandra, giving no clues to Willow's presence, unaware that Ellesandra could feel it anyway. Sylvia didn't move to do another strike, instead began to crackle from head to toe with black lightning, that she then discharged at Ellesandra by thrusting a hand forward. It would be quite difficult to dodge lightning of course, but it also showed that she didn't necessarily know that this sort of targeted attack was among the worst ways to try and fight Ellesandra. The lightning was strong, and even with resistance it would burn Ellesandra's every muscle, but it would be a bearable pain, and a short-lived one, as Ellesandra would be free to do with the rather plentiful mana whatever they wished.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ouch. Ellesandra was expecting her strike to miss or get deflected, but she had not counted on just how fast Sylvia was even past her haste and how the blunt end struck her so quickly. It was well controlled at least, proving that Sylvia didn't want to kill her - because she probably could have in that strike, if she'd wanted to. But especially without armor on, the blow caused her to grunt in pain and step a few to the side with the force of it, clenching her jaw against the bruising pain that shot through her. She didn't drop her weapon or haste though, eyes narrowed at Sylvia. The failure of a guardswoman again struck her in the gut, but it was also pushed aside. While in the middle of a fight, against an enemy like this, it was easy to shove those feelings to the side, to repress them, to focus on fighting instead. There was a brief flash of concern when she felt Willow rest on the rooftop behind her. She couldn't really fight off one of them for long, let alone if both decided to attack, but lucky for her Willow wasn't making any motion right now. It also meant that she wasn't going after any of the villagers, so she'd take that. The black lightning crackling over Sylvia was honestly kind of impressive, though less impressive when it was shot at her. Well, still impressive, just annoying. Ellesandra didn't have the opportunity to dodge it, but lucky for her - she was able to take the blow. The blue magical barrier around her that she'd cast previously, only barely responding to the physical strike, now glowed brightly as the black lightning struck. It obviously hurt, burning her muscles, causing her body to tense up and brace against it, pain shooting through her - but it wasn't nearly as bad as Sylvia probably expected it to be. Ellesandra also literally buzzed with the energy, the magic that it provided her with. She didn't show it's use immediately though. She gritted her teeth and growled, then struck forward with her rapier at Sylvia again. She fully expected Sylvia to dodge or deflect it, but she was hoping Sylvia didn't expect her own black lightning to shoot from Ellesandra's left hand back at her. She angled and aimed it in a way to ensure that if Sylvia did manage to dodge it, it wouldn't hit the unconscious man behind her. She hoped though, with her stabbing forward with her left arm, extending her body to partially hide her right hand coming up beneath it, the black lightning would just siphon into one point in the palm of her right hand, and then shoot back out into Sylvia's chest from beneath her left, extended arm. Either way, Ellesandra was trying to pull back again afterwards, to prevent an immediate counter attack, but with Sylvia's speed that might be useless.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sylvia had expected quite a bit more than what she got in reaction to the lightning. But still, she wasn't aware of how Ellesandra could fire it back at her, so when the knight came at her with weapon going for a strike, her arrogance let her believe it was another stupid, thoughtless attack. Ready to dodge it as she had before, the lightning took her by surprise. While the rapier missed, the lightning homed in on Sylvia as it burst from Ellesandra's palm, striking her with her own spell. She stumbled back a step, gritting her teeth. It clearly hurt, but the thrall was not so easily subdued, or even weakened. It was truly more of an annoyance to her, which begged the question of how much she was holding back against Ellesandra. She did look visibly angry at this point, now, however. She rose a foot and drove her boot into Ellesandra's chest, kicking them back off their feet and onto their back, clearly frustrated as she growled through barred teeth that she wasn't able to kill them. "Fuck it. You can survive without one of your arms, can't you?" she barked, then lunged towards Ellesandra, stance shifting with what was obviously going to turn into a slash that would cleave something important off Ellesandra rather permanently. Only this time, while Ellesandra was on their back or possibly scrambling to their feet, Sylvia was struck by what looked like a beam of light that made them stop dead in their tracks and suck in air. After the initial flash, it was clearly an arrow that was aglow with golden light now sticking through Sylvia's sternum and out their back, sizzling with divine energy. Then, a burst of light appeared between Ellesandra and Sylvia. Sapphire appeared in the wake of the flash, standing with a brilliant, shining greatsword in one hand. The sword was certainly the sort that a human needed two hands to wield, but Sapphire held it down at a diagonal as if it were a longsword in her left hand. In her right hand, a gilded and golden bow. Both it and the hilt of the blade were ornate masterworks, with intricate detail in the golden and silver metal that formed each; the bow's string was shining and golden. Radiant, divine energy wafted off Sapphire to an immense degree. Without even looking at Ellesandra, a beam of soft white light poured down on them. Immediately, Ellesandra was struck by what could only scientifically be described as a 'fuck you' amount of healing energy that would make their battle wounds banished in an instant, and make their muscles feel like they had just gotten a full night's rest after an invigorating workout. Limber and energized. Sapphire held a stern look on her face as she took in the sights around her. Sylvia, now, looked...Nervous. Sapphire looked Sylvia dead in the eye. Sapphire raised her longsword to point at Sylvia. "The arrow in your chest was cast from my slaying longbow. You'll crumble to ash, now, for your violence against these followers of Eldath."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had hoped the lightning did more than that. The fact she just looked annoyed was probably bad for her. This was shown with how her boot slammed into Ellesandra's chest, throwing her back onto her back. She grunted, the coat hanging open and well - naked, with obvious bruises along her rib and she wouldn't be surprised if there would be bad bruises along her sternum now too. She groaned, trying to move to get up when Sylvia began moving forward and said something about losing an arm. "Shit" Without thinking, her right arm was thrown up to block whatever blow it was. If Sylvia was going to take an arm, she could tell Ellesandra's right arm. It wasn't ideal in any way shape or form, but if it was going to happen - and it almost certainly would at this rate - she could at least choose her already injured arm, right? That didn't actually happen, though. She saw the light slam into Sylvia, and then Sapphic appearing. The healing that came to her was surprising, not only in that it was just a sheer amount of power but also because she hadn't expected Sapphire to heal her. She wasn't grievously wounded, after all - there were plenty of other villagers she could be focusing her healing on. Either way, though, she wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. She stood, pulling the coat close around her front again to mask at least some of her modesty - not that she cared too much, but no need to give them all a completely free show - and moved to stand beside Sapphire. "Don't pretend you're here for Eldath." She grumbled. Sapphire was here for Ellesandra, and for Star. Sure helping the villagers probably helped, and was a great bonus alongside it, but it wasn't like Eldath had sent Sapphire here. This truly was one thing she agreed with Valentina in - the deities couldn't give a fuck about the mortals that served them. Torm, and his follower's, treatment of Aeras had proven that. Ellesandra didn't let her guard down, despite Sapphire being here though. She shifted a bit so that she was partially behind Sapphire. To Sylvia, it would look like she was just hiding behind the angel, letting the super powerful being take on Sylvia rather than putting herself in harms way. In reality? She was covering Sapphire from the back, keeping a strong focus on Willow and if there was anything coming from that direction. She was careful not to look in Willow's direction directly, but she did glance back to look around, as if seeking any other trouble behind them. Keeping her eyes on the ground level, but certainly watching for Willow trying to pull any shenanigans out of the corner of her eye. Ellesandra wasn't sure if Sapphire could still sense Willow after giving that blessing to her, and considering her obvious power Ellesandra assumed she could, but you could never be TOO cautious.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sapphire's lips curled into a small smile. "On the contrary. I admit I'm a little surprised you didn't notice the realm in which we speak is a literal construction of Eldath's holy symbol." The waterfall falling into the still pond was one thing to recognize when it was used as a holy symbol, as it was in the church here, but whether Ellesandra did notice the one in that realm in which they spoke was homage to the goddess or not? Sapphire assumed they hadn't, though conceded mentally it was possible they just didn't say anything about it. Sylvia worked to stand, clutching one hand to the wound in her chest. It clearly was dazing her. Striking Sylvia down in this state would be much easier. Though it was true that Ellesandra was being smart about standing behind Sapphire, for Willow did attack. Unfortunately, Willow moved like a bolt of lightning, and even while hasted as they were, Ellesandra wouldn't have time to recognize what was happening before it happened. Willow was immediately behind Sapphire, likely poised to strike. However, Sapphire spun in place, releasing her sword from her left hand that she used to instead snatch onto Willow's wrist and then carried her spin into a shoulder toss that sent Willow careening past her and into Sylvia, sending both of them into the structure behind them, which they would have sailed clean through if not for a flash of white energy that acted as a barrier just before they hit the building, instead making the two of them smash against what was a solid wall of mana. The crunch of Sylvia's ribcage could be heard as audible pops of bones snapping under the skin followed. The shadow of Willow fell to the floor, then the cloaking faltered, revealing the woman at last. Dark armor covered the woman. A long, red crystalline, lance-like weapon was in her right hand. A dark metal kite shield was in her left hand. She pushed up swiftly to her feet, with anxiety...Fear, actually, rising in her amber eye. The face of someone who was having a full on panic induced from trauma might give. "D-DON'T LOOK AT ME!" she screamed, then vanished into flawless invisibility again. Then, the shadow presence of Willow bolted away, abandoning Sylvia as the speedy woman vanished beyond the border of Neet and beyond until eventually their presence vanished. Sylvia stumbled up to their feet, coughing up blood. Sapphire kept her eyes on the woman, but spoke to Ellesandra after a moment, having reset her stance after the frankly absurdly fast twirl she had performed. Sylvia and Willow were entirely different levels of fighters to Ellesandra...But Sapphire was an entirely different level to them, clearly. Untouchable. "I'll not stop you if you care for a little satisfaction of payback against Sylvia for her planting you on your back a few times. You won't be able to kill her permanently. Your rapier won't be strong enough to pierce her gem. But I'll leave whether you wish to coup de grace her or watch her crumble to ash up to you. And I'll break any more of her bones that she tries to use to retaliate against you for whatever you wish to do, worry not." A threat to Sylvia more than anything. Sylvia coughed up a spatter of blood onto the dirt. "F-Fuck both of you.." was all Sylvia had to say back. How the tables had turned.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Well, fuck. She hadn't expected Willow to be so fast that Ellesandra couldn't even react to it. It was good that Sapphire was prepared for it, because Ellesandra would have otherwise had to stand there and watch while she was skewered. Still, there was something satisfactory about seeing Willow thrown into Sylvia and them both go flying. She huffed and brushed off her front, trying to ignore how close she could have been to death at any point during that if they had decided to kill her. She was also curious why Willow hadn't just gone about killing all of the villagers while Sylvia distracted Ellesandra, considering that speed. The sight of Red Opal did surprise her, some. She stared, and the shock of seeing Opal probably worked to cover whether or not she knew that Opal was there to begin with. And then when opal shouted, to not look at her, she blinked and...actually obeyed. She looked away, just enough to keep the two in periphery rather than looking at Opal directly. She wasn't going to take her eyes off an enemy, especially not an enemy who was obviously so fast and powerful, but there was just something respectful about looking away when requested like that. If they ever had to fight Opal, she'd make sure to do so via her shadow sight rather than trying to force her into physical visibility, if possible. Though Ellesandra had no desire to take any of them head on again anytime soon. When Sapphire offered for her to beat Sylvia around a few times though, Ellesandra looked at her in disgust. "I'm not going to fight an injured, weak person just to satisfy my pride at her kicking me onto the ground." Ellesandra sounded truly offended by this. There was no honor in that, playing with Sylvia before Sapphire took care of her. And though Ellesandra would curse Torm's name and disdain him himself, she still followed and believed in a lot of his values. "If you're going to kill her, kill her. If not, send her back to Valentina to beg forgiveness and talk sense into her. Don't play with food or you'll be worse than the gods you serve, Sapphic." For someone who was so absolutely overmatched with both of the women present, she still seemed to be talking with a high and mighty opinion. Just because she knew both of these women could wave a hand and kill her didn't make her any less firm in what she thought was right.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a prideful smile that warmed up onto Sapphire's face as she heard Ellesandra talk. "She was dead, at least for now, the moment my arrow struck her," said Sapphire in response. There was a bit of pride, perhaps relief or general happiness, in Sapphire's tone, as well. It truly did warm her heart to hear how Ellesandra felt about it. Sure enough, after a bit less than a minute had passed, Sylvia collapsed to the floor before them both, face down on the dirt, and began to burn up in soft white flames until she turned to a pile of ash. The Blood Onyx within her was seen briefly on the pile of ash before flickering away, vanishing along with her scythe. Sapphire exhaled. Her sword and bow faded into nothingness. Her wings stretched out briefly, then folded neatly behind her again. She looked at the people laying on their faces, the blood everywhere, and her face twisted in anguish. Among the villagers on the ground, barely clinging to life, were the children that Ellesandra had seen, huddled in a small pile. "You did well," she began again. "I hadn't expected you to be able to destroy the source of their magic. Truly, everyone here might have actually died had you not pulled that off. And while I had no intentions of standing for that...Had I not already been on my way, your actions truly would have made all the difference. Indeed, even with my arrival...This outcome means that none of them will have had to suffer the pain of actual death. And I may bless them all so they recover without a single memory of this horrible nightmare of an evening...Just expect there to be talk of a collective nightmare tomorrow among the townsfolk. Whether you tell them the truth, or let them live in ignorance...I leave up to you." She paused, smiling again. "...You prevented a lot of pain, this night. Thank you, Ellesandra."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra turned to watch Sylvia die. There was no particular 'pleasure' in it, though there was relief. Sylvia being dead meant there were only two potential 'captains' to have to deal with, both of which were still plenty strong but also hopefully not as sadistic. Opal might be able to be scared away by seeing her? Whereas Emerald...well he seemed inclined to just throw toys at them. Hopefully he wouldn't try to do anything more than that again. It was too much to hope for, she knew very well, but there was still relief that Sylvia was out of the way. "Wicked scythe." Ellesandra complimented, nodding towards the weapon, before Sylvia could fully die. A compliment, even if Ellesandra fully detested Sylvia's virtues or morals in killing this whole town just to get to her. The reminder of that set in as she watched Sylvia turn to ash, and other than doing a quick check on her shadow sense to ensure Willow hadn't returned for revenge, she turned to look at the villagers. Her heart ached. She was clenching her teeth, looking around and, for the first time, seeing the huddled up kids. Her right hand made a fist, glancing over at Sapphire. She ignored any of the compliments, or confirmation that she did anything good here. "So you can ensure they're all fine? Not injured, or dead? Ricca too - those inside buildings. And - I'm not sure about Amelia and Amara, if they'd returned or not." Star had seemed unaffected, other than sleep spell, and she had a sneaking suspicion their resonance would have alerted Ellesandra if Star had been hurt while Ellesandra was busy fighting Sylvia. In fact, she wondered if Star had noticed her pain, or if the sleep well had done it's job in hiding it from her. Since she was healed now, she wondered if the sleep spell was still in effect on her, and turned to the Tavern. "Is there anything I can do to help? I can go check on Star, get some clothes on, and then come help as well."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sapphire took note of how Ellesandra ignored her words. She took the hint that that wasn't what they wanted to talk about, if nothing else. "Everyone will be fine, yes. At worst, a little on edge tomorrow from what they will have perceived as a dream. I will personally speak to Father Copia as a messenger from Eldath, so...Expect him to be particularly humbled. He will know it was not a dream, but that Eldath protected this place. Whether he'll remember seeing you? Hard to say. You've already done plenty, however." As she said this, Sapphire's hands pressed together before her. Warm, white light began to flow off her as if it were gaseous, spreading along the dirt roads to crawl peacefully along to the outer reaches of the settlement. As it touched each person it passed, there was visible life breathing into them. Their chests rose and fell more fully. The blood vanished. They visibly relaxed into a peaceful slumber, rather than the void of staring death in the face. "Take this time to figure out how you want to address your allies, and the people of Neet. Everyone will awake in their beds, and this place will look just as it did when you retired to bed. It will be just another day. As for your allies...I do not feel their presences around us. So wherever they are, they did not make it back here yet." And just as she was speaking these words, Valentina herself appeared where Sylvia had died in a twisted manifestation of black mana. Valentina gently kicked at the pile of ash with her boot, then looked at Sapphire, who stopped her magical channeling, and looked at Valentina. "...This is why I told you to let Star sleep. That she would have been gravely disturbed by the sights of death was certain...But being that I intervened, it was only natural that she would show up. I wasn't about to risk Star's life, no matter how certain I am that Valentina is only showing herself now because she knows Star is asleep," said Sapphire. Valentina wore a soft smirk. "Awfully cocky, Sapphire. You ought to respect more that my showing up in an instant anywhere, any time, regardless of what happens to Star, is a possibility."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra took a deep breath of relief when she saw the white mist going out and healing the injuries of the villagers. The relief she felt was enough to rival the arousal she ha earlier that evening. Her eyes specifically tracked the kids, ensuring all of them were healed and looking fine, before nodding to Sapphires words. She should message Amelia again, but as her hand patted where her pocket would be she was reminded that she was nude beneath this coat, and that even then she was mostly visible considering she hadn't taken the time to button it up. Her eyes immediately snapped up when Valentina appeared. The relief she'd had before with all of the villagers being healed vanished. Would Valentina do something to kill them anyways? Could she, with Sapphire there? Ellesandra wasn't suer their power differential, but with Valentina being unable to die she kind of put the fight in Valentina's corner. That didn't stop her from raising her Rapier, for all the good that would do. She glanced between Sapphire and Valentina, eyes narrowed, but...she had learned her lesson last time with Valentina specifically. Being too disrespectful to her would get Ellesandra thown on more spikes. With her free hand, she closed the coat up, feeling like with Valentina she acutally needed to hide herself or have some protection, while keeping her weapon ready. She would give coin to be wearing her armor right now, not because she thought it would actually protect her at all but just for the comfort it brought with wearing it. The idea in her mind of protection, despite that meaning nothing against these two. She took a step back towards the Tavern as well, specifically reaching out with her aura, or their resonance, to see if she could feel Star. To ensure Star was, in fact, asleep still, and not having woken with the disappearance of Willow, the crystal, and Sylvia. The last thing she wanted right now was for Star to be conscious and searching for Ellesandra, since they were no longer in bed together.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra would still feel Star's presence. It was still a content, quiet, calm, slumbering presence. There was a mild anxiety, but it was the same one that had been there when Ellesandra left, maybe a little stronger. Whatever was keeping her asleep was still doing so. Something confirmed by Valentina. "Easy, Ellesandra. Star's still fast asleep. I made sure she wouldn't wake for my little visit, though I hadn't ruled out the possibility of you doing something immensely stupid like carrying her out of the room to wake her anyway." Valentina then looked at Sapphire, as Sapphire responded. "You've crossed a line here tonight, Valentina," said Sapphire. Valentina looked amused. "Oh I have, have I? Did I finally find the weak spot? The thing that makes your pissant of a goddess get off her ass and order you here? Just had to massacre some people that believe in her, did I?" Valentina scoffed. "Like they're her fucking fan club or something, finally deigns to lift a finger," she went on, before being cut off by Sapphire, who looked visibly annoyed. "Enough!" she shouted, evoking a boom of divine energy all around her. "We're all painfully aware of how you feel about the current state of things, of the divine and the infernal's presence within the material plane--" she said, cut off by Valentina. "CURRENT state? Excuse you, it's been this way for a motherfucking MILENNIUM. Don't tell me anything was any different a thousand years ago when I was shot in the back and left to die. You did a hell of a lot more to actually help people when you were a human, and when you then became an aasimar, and then an angel. The stories you've shared with me of those days...You used to be tireless. You used to inspire me. Now you barely get off your ass to help anyone, and when you do, it's all just some scheme," said Valentina, vitriol dripping from her words. Sapphire closed her eyes, a single tear rolling down from either eye down her cheek. But otherwise, her face remained strong. "...There was a time...A long time, even after you were cursed, that you'd dare never compromise yourself, the values that you held dear, that Mizara inspired in you--" Sapphire was once again cut off by Valentina shouting. "Don't you DARE say her name! You have no RIGHT!" barked Valentina, met in turn now by Sapphire shouting back: "As if you could believe even for a MOMENT she'd approve of who you have let yourself become?!" A shout that visibly made Valentina flinch and take half a step back. "Make no mistake Valentina, I know the woman I love still rests deep within you. And you have denied it until you are blue in the face that this is some enlightened path you walk to try and destroy the gods and make the world anew, so fixated on the details that if you rewrite the laws of the universe enough times you can prevent people from living lives full of the suffering you feel, but it is plain as the sun is bright that it is the curse that has ruined you...And for that," she said, her voice lowering. "I cannot blame you. I cannot blame you for being cursed. It is no excuse for things like what you have tried to do tonight...For all the horrible things you do, directly or indirectly. But I know that if your curse was broken, you would never again lift a hand in malice." Sapphire's words were evoking the face of indecision, an inner battle within Valentina as she struggled to respond. Sapphire closed her eyes again. A moment for Ellesandra to interject, if they had anything they wished to say, or just a moment to sit with all that had been said. Nobody in attendance seemed to care that Ellesandra was holding up their rapier, as testament to how utterly pointless any form of violence would be in the moment.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Valentina reassuring her was odd. It did imply that Valentina was serious about not just making Star go crazy for no real reason, then. But still. She glanced back at the Tavern, only reassured because she herself felt Star sleeping. Her attention turned back to the deity level beings next to her as they just began to...argue. She blinked a few times, and then just straightened and closed her borrowed jacket up fully, closing her nude body to the chill. The argument between the two was interesting, but Ellesandra didn't interject. She fully agreed with Valentina in regards to the fact that the gods were worthless, and them sending Sapphire here wasn't proof that they cared about the lives of people in general. In that mindset, she was fully on Valentina's side. But she also was fully on Sapphire's side in that Valentina went wayyyyy too far with this stunt. And many of her stunts. Ellesandra fully believed in what Valentina was trying to do, but abhorrently against the method she was using to do it. It wasn't until the end, when Valentina got silent after the curse being broken comment, that Ellesandra piped up. "You know, if you redirected your focus towards finding something that could help cure, break, or destroy this curse, I'd even offer my help. Post getting Aurora back of course, but that's entirely at your control anyways." She offered Valentina a cocky grin, knowing damn well her help really didn't mean much at all. She had no doubt Valentina had spent this millennia, in some way, trying to figure out how to break it. Some random nobody failure guard - those words came back to her mind from Sylvia and a fresh pang of pain and shame shot through her at the thought - wasn't likely going to be the one to figure it out for her. But it was a poke that Sapphic was right - the curse being broken would end this. And, it would make it so Valentina was killable, if she deigned to do something like this again.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra offering their help had Sapphire smiling, cheeks still wet with tears. It almost didn't register for Valentina, however, who just looked at Ellesandra with an unchanged expression, still looking a little nervous after Sapphire's words. Valentina's eyes lingered, as if studying Ellesandra a moment, then shook her head. That Ellesandra was worlds out of their depth was obvious, so obvious she didn't even say it. Instead, she spoke with a pained tone: "As if I haven't jumped at every lead I've ever found.." she said, the truth of Sapphire's words on full display as the woman was visibly rattled. The 'other' Valentina. Or rather, the 'true' Valentina was starting to rise to the surface. Just for a moment. But some strong words and a single night could not untangle a millennium of suffering, so Ellesandra would see a familiar expression. Tension on their jaw, eyes shut tight. Forcing feelings back down, until her face could be a hard one again. Sapphire spoke up again: "Let me be clear, Valentina. I have slain Sylvia knowing you will simply bring her back again. I let Willow leave with her life, for like you I seek to save her, rather than act upon her with violence. Neither of you are beyond salvation. And I am truly the only one who can tell you that I understand the depths of pain you feel right now. That you feel always. I will never let you forget how noble you once were, how noble you still are, underneath all of this awfulness, even if you cannot see it yourself. But we have walked this road before. You have acted out, you have harmed innocents on great scale. My goddess Eldath will not permit you to incite war here in Gurhal. Our lady of peace will empower me to act how I see fit. I understand you intend on making life as hard as possible for Ellesandra and Star, and it remains true that Eldath will not release me to counter you at every juncture. But each step of escalation you climb will be judged, and when you grow too brazen, I will arrive again to SMACK you back down to earth. So, knowing how pragmatic you are about all this, understand that your direct interference will not be tolerated. Doesn't matter that you are immortal, doesn't matter how my heart aches for having to strike you down, I will do it a thousand times, and then a thousand more, in the name of saving you from yourself. You've already established your cult here. So leave your lackeys out of this, and let the future show whose conviction is stronger. Your followers and their designs of ruin...Or those who rise above the darkness and stand for the innocents you so carelessly would slaughter. An act that I KNOW twists your own heart in agony, which you can stand only because your heart knows so little else now." Sapphire's declaration was met with a calm silence, and a slow rise of remorse on Valentina's face. One that had her turning her gaze away with a curt "Fine," being her only response. She lingered for a short while. Enough time that Ellesandra could speak, if they wanted to. If they had nothing to say, Valentina simply vanished again, leaving Sapphire to get back to what she was doing in healing the people of Neet.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra wasn't surprised that she was ignored, though she ignored the smile from Sapphire. When the conversation continued, she kept quiet. She even considered slipping away, let these two have it out like the old times. But then Sapphire got serious. She watched as Valentina just...agreed. Agreed? Ellesandra blinked in surprise, then looked at Sapphire, then back to Valentina. She didn't say anything, but apparently Valentina had just...agreed, to not interfere? To not have her lackies come after them? After her disappearance, she looked back over to Sapphire. "Did I understand that right? She's not going to send her captains after us again?" Her voice held obvious suspicion. Even if Valentina SAID that, was she honest about it? Sure they'd still have to deal with this cult - probably the cult of fuckface Faust - but that seemed a lot more manageable to her than dealing with Valentina herself and her god damned immortal captains. She was pretty sure Sylvia could have wiped the floor with her, Star, Amara, and Amelia all together if she'd actually been going for kills and not playing around, or holding back. Even if Ellesandra had surprised her with the lightning blast, it wasn't like Ellesandra could survive getting that Scythe shoved up through her gut. Oh, Ellesandra wouldn't ever let her guard down about it, but the idea of Valentina having them back off was honestly a relief. Star would be safer, in that case.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"I've been dealing with her, bargaining with her, arguing with her, laughing with her, commiserating with her...For a thousand years now. I'd like to think I know how to talk to her by now," said Sapphire, her voice sounding melancholic. "Expect they will still taunt you. Still watch you. Perhaps even rally enemies against you. But I believe I've set a firm line for you, one that will make your aims possible. Valentina came here as a show of force, and I have responded in kind. It does mean that you cannot expect me to intervene directly like this again, either, so long as they keep their word. Ironically...She and I find ourselves in this same stalemate that she despises the gods for, as they lock in the same stalemate against the infernal world and its Balors and Devils and Archfiends. For every evil intervention that is prevented, an intervention of good is sacrificed. And somewhere in that, balance is struck, to avoid plunging the entire material realm into the chaos of war of the armies of good meeting the armies of evil and leaving nothing but destruction for all those caught in between. Yet rather than see that truth, even as Valentina herself participates in it with me...She continues to sink further into her sunk cost." Sapphire shook her head, sighing. "Overall, though...You will be safer. I believe that to be true. Do not believe that the enemies you will face will be weak...But they will be enemies you can overcome. I believe in that. In you, and Star. And with any luck...You might discover why in the name of all that is good that Valentina did this in the first place. Her violence may seem random...But it never is. Even this, it was entirely about you and I. You, to try and scare you off. And me, for targeting them because they worship my goddess Eldath."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't comment at first. She obviously disagreed at the idea that this was why the gods and devils didn't act. If it truly was, then it was foolish in her mind. But she was just a lowly, short sighted mortal - what did her opinion matter? Turning her eyes back to the people of Neet, she took in a deep breath and let it out softly. Sure, this was Valentina's fault. It was Sylvia's, and Willow's, for doing this to them. But there was still very much part of her who knew, it was her fault. If she just stayed away, they wouldn't have been in danger. Star would still be here, but would Valentina be so aggressive towards Star? No; this was to break Ellesandra. To remind her that it was her fault Marigold had died. "Let me know if you need anything then." Sapphire had told her to go off and plan. She would do that, but not before checking in on Star. Her first order of business after walking away from Sapphire was to make a path closer to the kids, to ensure they were all breathing, and actually okay. Seeing them hurt, the memory of them like that, struck even deeper in Ellesandra's heart. The idea that anything might have happened to them, permanently, hurt. It angered her, enough that even though she could see a lot of Valentina's point, she could not give up her hatred of the woman. The need to see her stopped. She walked back into the tavern, moving to take the coin and check on Ricca - to ensure she, too, was alright. She'd communicate with Amelia later - after she checked on Star, and put more clothes on. Part of her hopped Ricca was still sleeping on the bar, not really wanting to explain why she was in this coat naked if she wasn't.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Sapphire let Ellesandra go without another word. The children were alive, sleeping peacefully, and without a trace of the nightmare that had transpired. Slowly, the people of Neet floated up off the ground to be gently returned to their beds. Ricca, too, would be seen, slumbering, as she slowly lifted off the bartop and floated into the back room and up the stairs to return to her own bed. The coin was there where it was left. Star was okay, sleeping still, though the magical slumber spell had lifted, and there was certainly danger of Star waking now. Calm was there when Ellesandra came close, but the anxiety returned if they moved away, lessened by having felt them be okay and nearby, but she visible tensed in her face and groaned in her sleep at Ellesandra walking away, if they did. It was still night, and Ellesandra certainly hadn't gotten enough sleep. As adrenaline wore off, their fatigue was sure to return. But nobody was there to tell them to go to bed, of course. Sapphire was working on 'resetting' everything. Amelia, wherever she was, was likely asleep. Still, Ellesandra remained free to do as they wished.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched Ricca just lift up and begin to float off towards wherever she slept. The show of power would normally have awed her, if she wasn't in the current mental mood she was in. She felt like crying, despite having done so so much already that night. And before Star, she hardly let herself cry anymore. She pushed the emotions down, to the side, and just ignored them. But it seemed harder to do that now, now that the adrenaline wasn't there, now that she wasn't actively facing an enemy. She took the coin and removed the coat, returning it where she got it. Heading upstairs, she slipped into their bedroom and moved to touch Star's shoulder, just a physical confirmation that Star was fine. Feeling her relax a little at the touch made a smile twitch on Ellesandra's face, but she didn't stay there long. She turned to move and put some clothes on, then rubbed the coin to send a message, mentally, to Amelia. "Apologies for waking you. We were attacked, and I want to confirm you and Amara are safe. Star and I are fine." Ellesandra stared at the bed while waiting for a response, not expecting one immediately since if Amelia were sleeping, she'd probably be the type to be groggy. Her hands clasped in front of her and her shoulders were slumped slightly - a combination of weariness and just...a bad feeling. That this had happened because they were there, knowing that they were a danger anywhere they might go, to the people and the innocents around them. Even if Valentina kept her word, this cult might not follow those rules. And Sylvia's joy at the idea of killing these people, just to break Ellesandra. All of this, plus the now realization again that she'd had sex with Star - sex, in which Star had confessed her love for her. The doubts, the shadows, were circling in around her heart, only made worse by tonight's events. The dread that she'd hurt Star, that she wasn't enough. That she was just a failed guard and would bring Star down, get her killed - along with plenty of other innocents along the way. Ellesandra wasn't sure she'd be able to sleep that evening.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There would be some time before the response came from Amelia, mentally in Ellesandra's mind. "Fuck, we thought this would never work. We are in Myst. We are safe. Trying again tomorrow to teleport back to you." Other than that, there was nobody else awake, nobody to interact with, so if Ellesandra was going to stay up all night, it would be a lonely night indeed.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Thought it would never work? Did that mean they'd been trying to reach put? She considered this and realized that Valentina could have very easily just blocked the portal most likely. Maybe even communication. Ellesandra should have checked in that night before sleeping but...her eyes went to Star's sleeping form. She had been distracted. The memory of their lovemaking came back and she closed her eyes, putting her head in her hands, and whispering quietly to herself. "The fuck are you doing, El?" She took in a few deep breaths, staying like that in some way, shape or form for an hour or so. She was fighting against the desire to just...leave. to run. The commitment of staying with Star, KNOWING it would only bring Star pain in the long run. No matter how much she cared for Star, she just knew she'd hurt her. She wasn't relationship material; how could she be? And then on top of that bringing this attention to them and everyone innocent around them. Valentina may not have actually succeeded here tonight, but it still effected Ellesandra a lot. And unfortunately, she didn't feel like she could just push it down anymore. Nor did she want to talk to Star about it, so she kind of just...Sat with the guilt and anxiety, the commitment phobia, the self hatred. The image of those kids, and what might have happened just to make a point to her. She would eventually crawl back into bed with Star, moving to press her back against Star because she knew Star would want that physical contact. There were silent tears, but eventually, exhaustion would overtake her again. And if she was faced with any doors, she outright ignored them.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly didn't need to be awake to react to Ellesandra's presence. So when they back met hers, she turned in her sleep and slid her arms around Ellesandra, bringing them into a loving embrace with her nude figure pressing to their clothed one. Her love, her emotions, all of it was still bare to Ellesandra. Her aura was still visible, and the connection was just that much stronger when she held them. Perhaps Ellesandra's only light in the darkness, Star clung tenderly to them. There would be no doors on the second slumber. Nothing but regular dreams. Pleasant dreams, for Star would still fight adamantly, even unconsciously, against the darkness that tried to make Ellesandra bear nightmares each night. Nightmares would not ever win out while Star stood (or laid) on guard. A small grace for their heart in the otherwise brutal turmoils that plagued them until, eventually, morning came again, with Star still clinging affectionately onto Ellesandra.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra wasn't very surprised to have woken up first the next morning. While Star had kept her from nightmares that surely would have happened otherwise, she'd still slept fitfully. Concern of Valentina's return, of her Sylvia being revived and coming to take her vengeance, general paranoia kept her waking at any sound in the tavern - and sometimes not even at sounds, just her body going 'you haven't checked things in a while!' Stars felt love did a lot to help soothe her though, even if when morning came she still felt...wrong about all this. That, again, it was a mistake. But for now, she turned and just held Star close. Fingers trailing up and down her back, gentle caresses while she slept, or a gentle guide into wakefulness when she began to stir. Her eyes stayed on Stars face, a gentleness and affection there even if as soon as Star was alert she'd be seeing all those doubts and concerns and even more paranoia than normal. While Star slept, Ellesandra took the time to just hold her - because she wasn't sure how much she'd be able to do this I'm the future.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Happiness. That was what wafted from Star when Ellesandra stroked her back. The gentle caresses. The sweet tenderness. It stoked love, of course. But from that came happiness. Pure, sweet happiness from Ellesandra's little show of affection. It just made Star cuddle in closer, even going so far as to lean up and kiss Ellesandra on the jaw while she was still asleep. Soon after that, Star did slowly rouse awake. Peaceful at first, just rising to the waking world in the arms of the woman she loved. But then she did feel the doubts and concerns and paranoia. She rose up to alert more swiftly from that, looking up at Ellesandra with concern written clear on her face and hopeful for answers. "E-Ellesandra...Wha.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra raised a hand to Star's shoulder as she rose faster, pulling her back down into the cuddle. "Shh. Nothing to talk about right now. I promise we will when Amelia and Amara get here. Just...don't leave yet." She wanted to experience the comfort of holding Star like this a little longer. To pretend this was a normal morning, with no one after them, and nowhere to go that day. To pretend it was a day in their house, waking up with the sun and just being lazy in bed. Her eyes closed, that ache coming back. The ache of wanting that so bad, but even though she had Star in her arms, not believing it was possible. Not believing they could last to that, that she deserved that life. Was worthy of it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was quietly uncertain about Ellesandra's words. But, she trusted them. The trust had been built quite a bit, all the more so by the trust that was required for her to bare herself to Ellesandra the previous night. It had worked out well, and only further solidified the trust, the safety she felt with Ellesandra. So those uncertainties floated away. They said talk would come later. It was a promise. So Star moved back into the cuddle, squeezing more tightly. "...I'd never, ever leave you, Ellesandra." She wanted to say 'I love you', as well, but she knew that was dangerous, now. But oh, how her love swelled in her heart to try and let Ellesandra feel it regardless. Her love needed comfort. And all the comfort in her heart was given, without inhibition.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Those words made Ellesandra close her eyes tightly. She tried to believe them, she truly did. But she just...couldn't. Not because she thought Star was lying - she truly believed Star believed that. She just didn't actually think she was worth sticking around for. The kind of self hate and self doubt talk that refused to let her believe anyone could truly love her, not past the initial honeymoon phase. She took a deep breath and pulled Star closer, lowering her face into the top of Stars head and tucking her head against Ellesandras chest. Shirt or no shirt. "Don't make promises you can't keep, Star." The words came out softly, so quietly, that if Star weren't paying close attention she might not be able to hear them appropriately. And even if she did, Ellesandra didn't let her dwell on it. "We should shower, I don't know when the A team is getting here." Despite having just asked Star to stay and cuddle, Ellesandra was now trying to get them going. Ready for the day. Ready to talk about shit she didn't want to talk about, but needed to be shared. To make decisions on how they'd approach the townsfolk today, and how they'd handle future towns to stay in.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra might have a habit of saying things and then trying to just move on and not accept conversation about it, but that was just making a habit in Star to say screw all of that noise and make her voice heard. She squeezed them. They weren't rising out of bed, so she waited for Ellesandra to try and move on, then promptly ignored what they said and moved back to the first topic. "I wouldn't dare promise you something I didn't mean with all my heart, Ellesandra." The furry-ear-squad could wait, if they showed up. She was with her love, and her love needed her.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She sighed deeply as Star held on. Prevented her from escaping like she wanted. From using excuses to get away. Instead, she snuggled back down into Star, just accepting the comfort to her aching heart. Already denying her love for Star could be real. "Fine. That's you now. Things change. I'm not the life partner type person Star." Grief filled her again. At a life she wanted but truly thought was entirely out of reach. She took a deep breath, and added. "And please stop calling me Ellesandra. It's too formal. El, or anything else." That was...a lot of progress, actually. Ellesandra hadn't let anyone call her a nickname of her actual name since she left her home. Formal, distant, she'd always kept herself to the formality to protect herself, her turmoil of emotions. But now? It felt wrong, having Star use her full name. She never would have allowed it, if they'd met in happier times. And, as much as she truly meant this and wanted Star to call her by something else, it was also a distraction. To try to pull Stars focus to this topic instead.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled into the cuddle. She then felt the grief, closed her eyes, and just...Let it flow through her. Accepted it for what it was, and fought it with her comforts. "Things always change. That's never an excuse to not want something or promise something. A promise is a little way of saying that the person making the promise commits to what they say even if things change. Especially if things change. Besides...I think I've gotten enough of your pushback about life partnership that I'm due to remind you that I'm not...Saying there has to be any commitment." Even if the want, the longing for that, was incredibly obvious in her aura and flowing all over Ellesandra. Also obvious, but not through her aura, was her commitment to ignore these distractions Ellesandra kept throwing up. "When I say I'll never leave you, it means I'll never leave you. Friend, not friend, whatever we might be...You've become an irrevocable part of my life. I'm afraid I must break the bad news to you that you are stuck with me, now," she said, a hint of playful mirth in her voice. "And...Well, I like your full name. It's pretty. But if you insist, well...If it's really anything else...Are you sure you want to give me that kind of power here...?" Oh, she was two seconds away from calling Ellesandra 'darling' or 'lover', but didn't want to spark their fears again. Walking that fine line between wanting them to feel loved, without scaring them off...
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Oh, the pain was immediate. As soon as Ellesandra registered the words Star said - that there didn't have to be a commitment. That they could just be friends. It struck her right in her little, hidden romantic heart. Star had been trying to be comforting, to try to assuage the commitment fears, but it was never truly Ellesandra who was afraid of committing to someone else. She was, but she was afraid of that because she was afraid of them not committing to her, not being able to love HER. It was never a lack of her ability to love others, though she continued to deny her love for Star out of this fear. No, Star's words all but confirmed that this wasn't something that Ellesandra could count on. That this would end in pain for her no matter what, and most likely Star too, because Ellesandra would just be that bad of a partner. She simply wasn't truly lovable. It felt like Star had stabbed her. Oh, she hadn't - not really - but the way her chest tightened and it felt like there was a hole in the center of it made her wish it had been a physical wound. She tensed, and then began to pull away. Star would likely try to latch on, to stop her, but Ellesandra was adamant. She would peel Star's fingers off of her if necessary to slide to the other side of the bed and climb out. Her entire body was shaking, and she tried to take a deep breath to calm her pain. To push it down, to tell herself she was overreacting. To tell herself that Star wasn't saying that she wasn't serious about this, about them, but that she was trying to reassure that it would be okay if things changed. But Ellesandra didn't want things to change, not like that. She didn't want to be thrown away to the wolves again for not doing what Star wanted, like had been done with Marigold. Marigold had never loved her the same was she'd loved Marigold, but that hadn't made the treatment when she'd thrown title in Ellesandra's face and made her feel like gutter trash any better. Ellesandra wouldn't let herself get into that same situation again. She couldn't fall for Star so deeply, only to have Star fall for someone else instead. She didn't answer any of the follow up, if it had even happened. She honestly didn't hear anything Star might have said to correct herself, as soon as she'd felt that pain. Her ears were ringing and she felt like she needed to run. It wasn't even a thought process, no active conscious thought. Her feet were moving, pushing herself out of the door, and away from Star, forcibly if necessary. At this point, Star would have to use magic, or some kind of auramancy, to break through the haze in her head. The feral, animal instinct to run, to not let this repeat itself. Granted, even in this state, Ellesandra didn't 'run' far. She didn't leave the tavern. She went to the shower, if she'd gotten away. Closed the door behind her, slammed her back into it, and then sank to the floor. A door and a wall between them wouldn't do anything to hide the feelings from either party, but it didn't change that Ellesandra felt she needed that barrier right now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Confusion. What had she said? What caused that pain? What did she do to cause that? She didn't know. The pain, the confusion, it stunned her. Tears were immediately welling in her eyes. The self-hatred bloomed in her chest again. Why was she hurting Ellesandra again? She was trying to be gentle this time. She was trying not to scare them. She was trying to tell them there was no pressure. Had her love not been felt? How desperately she wanted them? How badly she loved only them? Star didn't love easily. She said as much. She had given a piece of herself to Ellesandra, a piece of her that still lived inside them and forever would. And yet, she was still hurting them. So Star was stunned, sadness overwhelming her as Ellesandra ran away from her. She hurtled back down to the depths of pain and self-loathing for her perceived failures and worthlessness. Yet even through that, loneliness burned in her heart the moment Ellesandra left. She became motionless, trembling in bed as the knight left to the shower. Their auras still connected them, still let one another feel what the other felt, diminished somewhat by the distance and barriers. But all that did was just make Star feel worse as the pain was there, radiating from Ellesandra, as a consistent reminder of how much of a failure she was.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

It made it worse, feeling the sudden pain and self loathing from Star. Even through the barriers, that just made Ellesandra feel like she was doing exactly what she was afraid of - just hurting Star, needlessly. Her legs came up and she held herself, arms wrapped around her knees and brought to her chest. Her face pressed into her thighs and she tried taking long, deep breaths. She couldn't get the feeling out of her chest, out of her mind. It was the same as when Marigold had told her her options were to obey her, or be tossed out of her job. Of the castle. Except, unlike last time, it wasn't just pain and anger in response. It was just pain, because Ellesandra had shared something with Star. And oh, logically, Star wasn't doing anything like that. But Ellesandra couldn't stop that she'd felt like it would happen, that Star was setting it up to just say they'd only become friends. That Star wasn't actually offering her that dream life, because Ellesandra truly wasn't lovable for that, worthy of that. Her heart ached more than it had in...well, more than it had before. She may not have verbally admitted to Star she loved her, but she did. And even with the feeling of Star's love, knowing that right now Star returned those feelings, she didn't trust that those feelings would last. It wasn't worth it, this pain. There were no tears, no sobbing or anger. Just...acceptance. She'd tried, right? She'd had a night with Star, but in the end, she was too broken. Even Star wouldn't be able to love her long term. Ellesandra stood after a few moments, feeling that pain coming from Star too. But what was she supposed to do about that? Ellesandra was saving them both more pain in the long run, to distance herself right now. At least, that's the shadow of dark thoughts that swirled around her head. And then, she just...numbed. Accepted that this would never happen for her, and rather than try - because she had been trying with Star, no matter how feebly it had been - it was best to just lock that dream away. Lock those emotions away, entirely. To just...not feel. If Star thought she'd been closed off, withdrawn when they first met? It was like Ellesandra had taken those defenses, and then built a metal fortress around it. She felt, and looked, emotionally numb. It was closer to how Ellesandra had been when Sophia had sent her off from the camp in the middle of the night. Not quite AS zombie as that, not entirely disassociated, but...it was the same trauma response, the same survival response in her to just disconnect her emotions from her body. The positive side of this was that there was no pain to be felt from her anymore. She'd repressed it so strongly, accepted that her emotions just...weren't good. And so, when she finally got up to begin taking her shower, she did so robotically. When she got in, she hardly felt the water. So, she turned it up. Hot. To the point that it broke through the numbness enough to be felt. Which for her, felt just...a little hot, not too bad. For the average person? It was way, way too hot. Even just a few moments under the shower, the time it would take Star to get dressed and come to the door, her skin was turning red, irritated. Ellesandra hardly noticed, going through the motions of taking a shower, automated mind taking over where Ellesandra was just...not there. And it was with that that, despite Star banging on the door or pleading, Ellesandra didn't respond. She also didn't lower the water temperature. She did stop her showering, but just to stand under the water, staring at the door. And if Star entered - because the door wasn't locked or anything, she hadn't had the presence of mind to do that when coming in earlier - she would just see Ellesandra standing there, staring at her. Numb.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Stop! Stop! Please stop!" came the sobbing pleas. Star banged gently on the door, then on instinct flung it open, not expecting it to actually be unlocked. But since it was, and she entered, seeing the naked, red Ellesandra, looking at her, numb? Star's eyes went wide. Pain rocketed through her. What...Had she done? What did she do? How could she hurt Ellesandra like this? How could she be so careless? So cruel? It cracked her heart at its core, and her aura began to flood and swell. The energy overflowed, not unlike it had in Myst. The mana began to crack and split into the floorboards below. If Ellesandra stayed numb, stayed uncaring and unfeeling towards her, then Star's aura was only going to further spiral out of control as she lost a hold on her purity of self, and the toxic feelings of self-loathing took root more deeply inside her. Ellesandra would need a drastic shift and need to snap out of this to prevent what happened next; Tears poured out of her eyes that were now ablaze with mana. She could only say one thing: "I-I'm...S-Sorry.." before her aura burst, which Ellesandra would be able to see this time as it fractured and lost its smooth, wavy pattern, flashing a bright red and splintering into shards around her instead of caressing her skin like it had been. Star then fell to her knees, loosing gasping breaths and clutching at her heart as she tried and failed to fight off the self-loathing that was consuming her. Before long, if it had not been stopped, she would fall to the floor, unconscious.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There was concern - but the concern didn't break her out of her shell. Her shell was solid. She stared at Star, eyes scrunched up, and concern for Star...but that wasn't the same as sharing love with her. Feeling her love. And so, as the aura burst and Star apologized, Ellesandra began to step out of the Shower. The concern was obvious in her aura, but it was just about the only thing could be seen, or felt, in Ellesandra's aura itself. The love that Star would have normally felt here, which was what caused the concern, even if it was hidden, wasn't overflowing out of the shell. As she had been moving towards Star, when she collapsed, Ellesandra caught her. Inside the shell, her heart sank even further. She had hurt Star this badly, again. Both times Star's aura had gained...'poison'... had been her fault. She truly was just going to make things worse for her. Ellesandra leaned down, ignoring that she was dripping water on Star, and hefted her up. She walked out of the bathroom, naked and uncaring, while carrying Star back to their room. Star was placed on the bed, and then Ellesandra turned to pull out a towel from her bag. She dried off quickly and put some clothes on, her body still just....going through the motions. When she was dressed, she turned and stared down at the unconscious Star. She didn't know what to do here. She'd caused this, but she didn't think her leaving would just fix this. Maybe after Star was fixed, she could go off after Aurora on her own, but while she was like this leaving would probably just make it worse, wouldn't it? Ellesandra moved to sit on the bed next to Star and laid her hand on the center of Star's chest. "You need to wake up." She said, as if that would help. As if it would do anything. She was still just as unfeeling as before.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was no just waking Star with words. Star was feverish. In pain. Chills ran along her body under her clothes as she lay there, unconscious and weak. Touching her chest did not wake her, but it did form a pulse in Ellesandra's chest. Not a heartbeat. It was something...Magical. That piece of Star, the piece of her that she had given Ellesandra, now irrevocably part of them, was beating like a heart. It sounded alarms. It poured Star's love into Ellesandra. It called out to them. It pulled on Ellesandra's heart, frantically trying, with one last desperate effort, to latch onto that concern, the only feeling that was there, to pull it out, stronger. YES! CONCERN! CONCERN REQUIRED! STAR IN DANGER! It had no voice, but it screamed in Ellesandra's chest. A part of them that they could not silence, for it was not Ellesandra within them, and Star would never embrace or accept numbness. Sooner than be numb, she became ill, as she was. She did not wake, but the part of her that lived in Ellesandra was pulling, tugging, doing whatever it could to try and pull Ellesandra into Star, connect them with that familiar sensation of trance that Star had induced in them twice before.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the tugging. Felt the piece of Star inside of her fight against the shell, trying to pull her own heart out of it. The response at first was Ellesandra tightening the shell, scrunching up on herself. The pain at the perceived rejection, perceived promise that this wouldn't go anywhere - that it was just destined to change into friendship, or less - within the shell wasn't one she wanted to release. But the tugging of the concern that Star was in danger did, in fact, do what that piece wanted. Ellesandra couldn't just ignore that Star was in danger. Even in a numb state, she KNEW she cared for Star. Knew she'd regret it even more if she let something happen to her. Knew that just because she was a failure and unworthy, didn't mean she should just walk away without trying to help Star out of this. And so, she closed her eyes and worked to try to slowly open herself up just enough to allow the trance connection to be induced. It wasn't easy, or immediate. her doing this had been entirely a reactive thing - she hadn't consciously made the decision to build these walls back up. It was the feeling of that pain that her survival instinct just slammed down the defenses over. And to open it up enough to try to connect with Star would require feeling it, at least somewhat. "Don't let your cowardice cause her death too, El." The words came out to herself, trying to embolden herself to do it. Star would hate her for this, but her left hand came up to her right shoulder and she placed her thumb onto the scar from where the sword had pierced straight through her. And she pushed. It wasn't the same pain as then, it wasn't that much pain in general honestly. But it was pain, and it was a reminder. And it was enough to help her break through - to solidify that she would not let Star die too, just because she was a horrible partner. She may still be that, she may still be unlovable, but she wouldn't let someone she loved die again. The trance started at that thought. The first time she'd let herself admit that she loved Star. The shock of admitting that to herself broke the shell and her mouth opened. And then she looked to Star, and grief and pain hit her again. Pain at what was said, grief and guilt that she'd caused Star to be in a state like this again. She lowered her hand back to Star, and clenched her fist into her shirt, closing her eyes, and letting the trance overcome the both of them - for whatever it would look like this time.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Rain. Torrential, pounding rain. Where this trance state was once a field of flowers, bright and beautiful, it was now a rainy wasteland. The flowers were black shunts of rotted, wilted remnants of what they once were. Black clouds hung overhead, with the sky cracked and red and flashing with lightning in the abyss beyond. A manifestation of Star's fractured aura. The rain pummeled the earth, relentless and powerful. Except, not Ellesandra. It passed right through them. But Star? Star was there, a short walk away, on her knees, clutching herself, and WAILING with all the strength her lungs could muster. Pink, wispy lines of emotion tried to approach her, but deflected off some unseen shell around her. One bounced off and in doing so shot over to flow through Ellesandra. It triggered a memory. A memory of their night together, but from Star's perspective. "I've never been more okay, Ellesandra...All of this is making me happier than I've ever been." Words said through misty eyes. The love swelling in her heart was exactly what Ellesandra had felt in that moment, as was the desire for that love to be emboldened, nurtured, forever held onto. "I-I'm...It's..." That same pause. The desire to say it was immense, though it had the tiniest fear that she would be rejected, that Ellesandra didn't feel the same even if she felt the flames of their love dance together. "I-I'm beyond just...F-Falling for you, now..." The same gulp. The pounding of her heart. The absolute euphoria of the moment. The certainty of her feelings could not be contested. "I love you, Ellesandra," came the confession, again, along with the desperate want and desire to hear it back. The memory offered a clearer picture of how Star felt in the moment, for it wouldn't have Ellesandra's own emotions and thoughts distracting them quite as much. That wispy pink energy vanished into Ellesandra, coiling around the piece of Star that lived in Ellesandra, and a happy little pulse burst from it, solidifying the memory to be one that Star cherished deeply. Connecting the memory to happiness, immense happiness. Something that Star herself was trying to hold onto, but these battering rains and wailing cries of pain shut the happiness out of her heart. Emotions were raw in this realm; the piece of Star inside Ellesandra fought to banish the darkness in Ellesandra's heart, but it wasn't as strong as Star herself. It was but a fragment, but the desire to comfort Ellesandra was constant and consistent. The flame of love was undying in that spark of her. The atmosphere around them carried Star's poison emotions, and just as Ellesandra was finished receiving that positive memory, something peculiar happened before their eyes. Another Star showed up. This other Star had anger on her face. She was swirling with dark energy. The dark Star moved to the wailing one, leaned down to grab her true self by the hair to tilt their head up, then drew back a hand and slapped her true self clear across the cheek, causing a shrill yelp from the true Star. "WORTHLESS piece of TRASH!" screamed the dark Star. "You can't even comfort the woman you love?! What the hell is WRONG with you?!" she shouted, then moved a foot to plant on the true Star's shoulder and shove the true self to the dirt as the true self wept, moving to hug herself. If Ellesandra didn't intervene somehow, this obvious self-torture was only going to continue, and likely get worse.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't know what to make of this trance. She still felt pain. She still felt worthless, herself. It wouldn't honestly be a surprise if a version of herself appeared alongside the dark version of Star and slapped Ellesandra as well. Their emotions felt very similar right now, though for obviously different reasons. The feeling of the positive memory - it hurt Ellesandra. She remembered her inability to say those words back, and felt how much Star wanted to hear them. Just another reminder why she wouldn't be a good partner. The pain ached and she internally screamed for the numbness again. The clenching in her chest made it hard to focus on the surroundings, on Star, but she did. Because she loved Star, and she wouldn't let Star go through this if she could help. Seeing Star slap herself - or well, the dark version do so - almost sent Ellesandra to slap the dark version of Star. If it had manifested as anyone other than Star, she would have. She would have run the dark Star through for dare touching Star, but Ellesandra couldn't bring herself to actually raise a hand to someone who looked like Star. The desire to intervene and physically separate the dark version of her lover rose and fell. Instead, she moved to just stand between them, her back to the dark version, preventing her from putting a foot on Star's shoulder. She opened her mouth, but didn't say anything. What was she going to say? She didn't know how to comfort Star, not when her own turmoil was...being felt. Not when she just wanted to curl up and cry, too. After a moment, she didn't speak. She just reached out, to pull the true Star into a hug. It may or may not be the right move. Unlike normal, her dark thoughts and emotions weren't being held back in this trance state, and there was a concern that physical touch might just let Star feel that pain and make it worse. But she also knew Star responded to physical comfort well. Better than Ellesandra did, who needed more than just physical comfort. She needed reassurance, words, truth spoken to her. She reached out to pull Star into a tight hug and lowered her face into Star's shoulders, whispering softly. "I'm so sorry, love. You...deserve so much better than this. You'll find better." Because Ellesandra truly, deeply, loved Star. And despite feeling Star's love the previous night, her trauma and past made it hard for her to accept that she could ever truly be loved. Not like she loved in return. She could be loved like Marigold had loved her - loved, and then thrown away, or downgraded to being a friend. But the love that Ellesandra wanted, needed? Even if that's what Star felt now, she could not bring herself to believe that was something that would last. So, she knew that Star would find better, eventually. Would find the right person to love, that wasn't Ellesandra, because she just wasn't that person for anybody.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The dark Star was still Star, indeed. Violent towards herself, but she would respect Ellesandra stepping between. Then, *poof*. They were gone. It would take just a moment for them to come back, but Ellesandra intervening banished them for now. Star adored physical affection, and that hadn't changed. She clung to Ellesandra the moment they came to her, sobbing into their shoulder. But when Ellesandra spoke, there was...Confusion. She pulled back, looking at Ellesandra. "W-What are you talking about..?" she asked, her voice shaking. She shook her head. "I should be the one apologizing to y-you...I-I don't want anyone else...Ever. I gave a part of me to you," she said, her voice tender. The pain was still thundering through her, but as was the case for both of them so often, the need to comfort the other superseded their own pains. She held onto Ellesandra's shoulders, looking them in the eye. "You're the one who deserves better than me. I-I keep...Hurting you, a-and it...I can't...I'm just so sorry for not being better for you...I love you so much, Ellesandra. Everyone's been so cruel to you and I just want to take all your pain away...I just want to love you.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra didn't quite know how to take what Star was saying. On the one hand, she was saying the right things. On the other, Ellesandra just...couldn't accept it. She was too broken inside. Too jaded to truly believe that Star would love her, forever. "No, Star." Her words came out whispered, pained. But she wasn't sobbing. Her pain was beyond that of crying at this point. It was just...suffering. She had an idea of what Valentina felt, even if on a much smaller scale. She just...suffered. "I've broken you twice now. I shouldn't have ever let it get this far. I deserved what I got then, and I deserve the pain now for what I've done to you." Her fingers tightened on Star's back, bunching up her top. "I know you won't be able to love me forever. That...that eventually you'll just think of me as a friend, even though I'll still love you wholly. And I don't think i can do that Star. I can't go through that again." Tears were falling, but it wasn't sobbing. It was just..aching. The gut truth, that she would love Star to the end of time but didn't feel that Star would be able to love her the same. That Star herself had said there was no commitment, that they could just be friends later. It wasn't what Ellesandra wanted. Ellesandra wanted that love, that connection and those dreams, with all of her heart. For a night, and a brief time before, she'd thought she might be able to get that with Star. But she'd been foolish, blind, and because she'd let her guard down things had escalated to this point. To the point she'd once again broken Star's emotions. The guilt of that weighed heavily on her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

More confusion. What they did to her? What about what she did to them? She looked at Ellesandra, pained and shaken, for a few quiet moments. She wasn't even going to touch on how Ellesandra was telling her how she felt again. At this point, she took Ellesandra's cheeks in hand. Gentle. Tender. But she looked at them with certainty and conviction. "You'll never be just a friend to me ever again." Ellesandra was saying the word 'love', and it was making her heart explode. "Ellesandra, listen. To. Me." She had weight in her words, holding Ellesandra's face to focus on her as she sniffled. "If you asked me to marry you right. Now....I'd say yes. And it'd be the happiest moment of my entire life, and I'd never regret it, and never look back with anything but happiness. So don't...Tell me I'm just going to think of you as a friend, because there's no going back for me."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. Pulled her face away from Star's hands, though she didn't pull away from Star. She just ducked her head back down into her neck. Unable to look at her right now. Her heart beat faster at the reiteration that Star loved her, but...she still didn't believe it. "You said it, yourself." The words came out, pained. "That things would change, and we'd just be friends. That that was a possibility. I can't, Star. You're just...first love, infatuation. You don't know what you're talking about, that your feelings will change. They will." Ellesandra believed this so fully. That after all of the times in the short timespan of knowing Star she'd already hurt her. By telling her about her mother, by pushing her feelings down. The pain that Star must have felt just seeing that mountain of unaddressed emotion. Then the first time Star had broken, at Ellesandra repressing her burgeoning affection for her. And then now, the worst of it all. Star having been so broken her own self was kicking her. She shook her head. "I'm too broken to be a partner to you, Star. You'll figure that out in time. And it's best that I just...accept that. That I'll be alone forever." Her voice broke again at this. She tightened her hold on Star. As if while her words were saying she was going to be without Star, without that feeling for the rest of her life, her body refused to let go of her. To actually follow through with the idea of accepting that. The pain was almost overwhelming, but if this is what Star needed to feel from her to know, to understand how bad of an idea it was, and that they just needed to push their emotions down - then she'd do it. She wouldn't let Star dwell in this despair that she'd caused.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star held back onto Ellesandra, still speaking tenderly to them, but now with a confused, paint tint: "W-What are you talking about? I only said that because every time I told you I was falling in love or when I actually told you I loved you, it scared you...I don't want to pressure you with how badly I want you, Ellesandra. I don't want you to accept my feelings just because you want to make me happy...I want you to want me. It's not infatuation anymore, Ellesandra...I already passed that. The only change my feelings will have is how much more strongly I know I can love you, and how I can be better for you. I'm only...Like this, right now...because I hurt you so badly..." Of course, Star wasn't letting go. She held onto Ellesandra, as she always had, and always would. "Nothing hurts me as bad as the idea that I'll hurt you so badly you couldn't forgive me, that I'd just end up like those other people who hurt you...I'm terrified that you'll hate me for the mistakes I keep making, Ellesandra...I want to be yours. Forever."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. She squeezed harder, refusing to really believe. It wasn't just a matter of accepting it; she wished she could, but it was so hard to believe. "I can't love you and lose you, Star." Her voice was raw. But she already loved Star. And she was already going to lose her, it was just a matter of now or later that her heart would be broken. She pulled away enough to look Star in the eyes, frowning. "I will always forgive you, Star." Her words were soft. Reassuring. Trying to ensure that Star knew this, that Ellesandra's love for her was one in which she could not hate Star for anything she did. She hesitated, lips trembling, then closed her eyes. "And I want to be yours, forever." The admission was raw. Terrified. And vulnerable. She wanted to pull away, but pulling away last time had lead to this. So instead she snuggled back down into Star's shoulder, hiding her face. Hiding her vulnerability. Her wants, her dreams. Because to share them, meant being vulnerable about losing them, again. The pain that had come with that when Marigold had told her she was marrying someone would be nothing compared to the pain that would surely come when Star decided to leave her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's heart ached. The pattering of rain all around was still strong, but...It had lightened, somewhat. This talking it out, letting one another be raw with each other, be vulnerable, let their feelings be known...It was helping. Helping guide her back to normality. Hearing Ellesandra say those words, saying they wanted it, same as what she wanted, made her heart ache like it was pressed into a bittersweet vice, something she tried to mirror in holding tight onto Ellesandra. "Then be mine," she said, tender and breathless. "Be my lover...Be my darling...Be with me forever, Ella. Please. I'm begging you. Be mine."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She wanted to. The first request to be hers was dismissed, shaking her head. She couldn't. But when Star called her Ella, not Ellesandra? Her heart skipped a beat and she held tighter to Star. Held her like her life depended on it. She wanted to agree to this. But she didn't know that she could do so. "Star." She whispered. Not refusing it, but also not agreeing. The word was pained as she held on tightly, unable to say yes. Unable to trust that though Ellesandra would always be hers, that Star would always give herself to Ellesandra. Finally, after a moment, she phrased it exactly that way. "Star, I'll be yours as long as I live." She whispered, still into her shoulder. "I'm already yours." And it was true. Even when she'd pulled herself away, put a shell down, she was Star's. She was still going to protect Star, go with her on this journey. She would have held herself back, distanced herself, but she would always be there for Star. Until Star threw her away like Marigold did. That was just how Ellesandra loved; she loved and protected, supported, until it was made entirely clear that it wasn't wanted. That it wasn't returned. And she just waited for that to happen.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't quite know how to interpret those words. She wanted to, and indeed chose to, interpret them as an acceptance of her feelings and a reciprocation. That she could think of them as lovers, and that was okay to do so. This whole notion that it was somehow Star that was going to get rid of Ellesandra was just...Absurd to Star. Not in that Ellesandra's feelings were invalid, that that fear wasn't real, but in that Star knew herself, and her feelings. She was always going to love Ellesandra, even if the worst came to pass between them. That love would never die. If she didn't understand how deeply Ellesandra was wounded in their heart, she might have been offended with how the knight kept insisting she was going to abandon them. Of course, she saw what Marigold did. She would have words for that woman, except, well...Gone. So. She'd just reinforce in herself that, now that Ellesandra seemingly wasn't going to run the hell away from her any time she was honest about her feelings, she was going to make sure Ellesandra felt like the most loved woman in all the realms. Being told these things...The clouds receded. The rain stopped. There was still damage, but it was...slowly repairing itself. Flowers were starting to bloom around them again. She was healing. Her tears were slowing, too. "And I'm yours, Ella. My love. Please stay with me, forever. Please fight back against that fear in your heart. I love you with all that I am. I gave you all of me, so please...Let me love you."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt the love. Heard Star's words. If anything the use of 'Ella' was what she truly latched onto though. The rest...well, she heard them, and she recognized that Star believed this right now. But internalizing it, truly believing it herself? It would take a lot more healing before that could happen. Before she could truly accept Star's love entirely, and no be waiting with a baited breath for the other shoe to drop. She pulled away from Star's neck, looking at her slowed tears, and leaned in to press a kiss to her cheeks. Stopping the tears in their tracks, the soft reassuring pressure of her lips to each cheek. And then to Star's lips. Soft, not horny or aroused. Just...gently reassuring, that Ellesandra loved her. And that she'd love Star, even if she expected Star to hurt her down the line. Even if she expected herself to hurt Star, because she still didn't believe herself to be a worthy partner to her. She didn't let the kiss evolve past the gentle brushing of lips before she whispered. "We have to set boundaries, Star. I...I know me running and hiding, creating distance, hurts you. But I can't not do it if you push past what I'm comfortable with constantly. It's...It's hard for me, doing any of this." She took in a deep breath. "And I know i need to stop turning to physical pain to help distract from emotional. So, two boundaries. What else?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star returned the kiss. She always would. She was the absolute farthest from horny she could possibly be, so it was taken only as a reassurance of their love. She looked at them with anxious, vulnerable affections. She wanted it all so desperately, but hearing the words Ellesandra spoke reminded her that her being overzealous was difficult for them. That was where she had the troubles. When to reinforce how much she was in love with Ellesandra and wanted so much with them, and when to be conservative and not push the matter. She swallowed a lump in her throat, feeling guilt for what Ellesandra described. Pushing past their comforts constantly..? It hurt to hear it like that, reinforced the self-hate. But she fought it, because being stuck in that wasn't helpful for Ellesandra. She just had to be better, even if it took some beating herself up to get there. So she nodded. "No death..." she said, somewhat automatically. Obviously, neither could help it if a meteor just landed on them tomorrow. But it meant no being stupid and self-sacrificing. Star, not putting Ellesandra through what Marigold did. Ellesandra, not throwing their life away. But truly, Star was the open one. She was the one who needed to know where Ellesandra's boundaries were, so she hoped they had more to tell her.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra winced when she felt the hurt, the self hate from Star. She nodded at the no death, agreeing to that silently. Recognizing that it would also mean that Star wouldn't sacrifice herself like Marigold did. She still might throw Ellesandra away later, but it wouldn't be putting her in danger. She took a deep breath and clarified, what she'd meant before. "Star, I...I didn't mean you push too much all the time I just...when I'm pulling back, you have to let me. That's step one to protect myself, and if I'm not allowed to do that I'll need to distance myself physically. It's one thing for specific, important topics to push, but..." But it was everything. If Ellesandra didn't share everything, didn't talk about everything, Star pushed. Which for Star's part, was because Star was totally open about everything and wanted Ellesandra to be so too. But she just wasn't. She didn't have the emotional processing power that Star did. It took time for her to work through things, and even if she wasn't repressing said things. She added, though, for the next boundary. "No being with anyone else. I...if you want to be with someone else, it has to end between us first. I'm not open, like that." The idea of Star with someone else hurt, a lot. She tensed and shook her head, forcing the image down and away. She might believe it would happen eventually, but no reason to torture herself about it now. "And this was said before, but no healing that hurts you unless necessary. Sympathetic healing, only if I'm on the edge of death or need it during a fight. Okay?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

A bit of comfort washed over Star when Ellesandra clarified. She nodded. Let them pull back. She...She could do that. Even if she was scared of them running away, she could learn to let them. That her letting them pull away was just as loving as her fighting to pour her heart out, where appropriate. She could accept that, though she expected some stumbling there. But stumbles, she could deal with. When Ellesandra went on to talk about 'other people', the confusion was...Obvious. Just...What? They were in their trance state, still, so actual, literal question marks made of mana appeared over Star's head. The manifestations of emotion in this place were occasionally on the nose. But despite the confusion, she took it seriously. "I...Okay. I understand. That...You aren't going to have to worry about that boundary, Ella. Honestly...If either of us needs to be worried about random advances on one of us, experience thus far says you'll be the one needing to hold that boundary," she said, smiling. "No specifics obviously but...Y-Yeah. Not like that jealousy I felt in the past was coming out of nowhere...I'm only interested in you. Period. And as for healing? Well...Sympathetic healing is useful, but the only thing that was holding me back from wanting to deepen our resonance was the danger that I was gonna jump on you and kiss you, which would have been bad at the time what with it being random and...without consent and stuff. I just really, really, really wanted to kiss you," she said, blushing a little. "I still do. Constantly. But now that it's okay..." Right, she was going somewhere with that. Stop getting distracted by Ellesandra's lips. "The more we empower that connection, the more my regular healing will work on you. And, erm, well...It took a big jump when we had sex. Kinda...D-Didn't know that was gonna happen."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked up at the question marks, eyes scrunched up in concern and confusion. "This place is trippy" She muttered beneath her breath. Still, though, she focused back on what Star was saying and shook her head. "Just because I was attracted to the professor doesn't mean I would do anything about it." Ellesandra, being completely oblivious that Amara had been interested in her, assumed it had been related to that. But, that was a boundary for both of them, which was a good callout. The comment about wanting to kiss her made her smile softly, a little confidence coming back and considering teasing Star by kissing her, but she didn't. She wanted to finish this conversation, it was important. "Yes, and you having wings is a new development we'll need to talk about at some point. I definitely feel the difference in our connection, and that I can see your aura - also something we need to talk about at some point. But right now..." She paused, looking at Star, trying to think if there was anything else. Finally, she added - "And I don't want to know about emotions you see in others. That was already discussed, but since we're having this conversation now, I thought I'd reiterate. And lastly, on my side anyways...." She dropped her voice, intentionally into a sultry whisper to try to make this last one funny, and embarrassing for Star. "I'm not a fan of licking assholes." With all the tears, sadness and pain, she wanted to hear Star laugh. Or see her blush - whichever one would win out.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star just smiled as Ellesandra spoke about the attraction to the professor. Nope. Not who she was talking about. But also yes, that. Silence reigned on that front. A secret she would hold forever. Hopefully forget someday. Though, she tilted her head. "I had wings?" she asked. More question marks. Apparently she missed that part. Just like she missed her having ears before. Still quite a lot about her powers she was ignorant to. "Oh, erm, right...Later." There were details to recall, but they were for later. And them being able to see her aura? Interesting, but didn't bother her in the slightest. Maybe even excited her a little. The notion of not wanting to know emotions of others was met with a small nod. No arguments. Then, the comment about licking assholes? Star went wide-eyed. Blushed. Then stifled a laugh. Then failed to stifle it as it hit her again, and she fell backwards, laughing, onto the wet grass where flowers once again bloomed. The sun broke through the clouds, bringing warmth and illumination. Arms fell outward, laughs turning to giggles. "...Do people really do that?" she asked, giggling. She then shook her head. "N-No, we're agreed on that...I think our first time was illuminating about what you like."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra felt a wide smile cross her face when Star started to laugh. And then the sun, and Star falling back on the grass. Star just...being happy again, giggling, made Ellesandra's heart swell with love. There was still pain, still hesitation. She still didn't feel truly 'safe' in this love, that it would last. But she would do what she could, to protect Star during this, at least until she chose otherwise. Moving to lay down next to Star on the ground, she smiled and pulled her into a light cuddle. Head resting on Star's chest. "They do. I'm not judging them for what they like, I just thought I'd share I'm not particularly into it." There really was no judgment there. It was a 'whatever someone likes is their own thing' situation. She had just expected, and was right, that it would lighten Star's mood. And yes, their first time had been very illuminating about what she liked. Oh there were still things for Star to explore, to find out, or for Ellesandra to outright tell her, but the main thing had been identified. She held Star for a moment, and then took a deep breath. "I don't know how time works here in this trance, but if it's been passing we should probably get back. I have a lot to tell you and the A team about what happened last night while you slept."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was pleased to have Ellesandra join her, and cuddles were always on the menu. "I think it's safe to say I'd never have tried that anyway, but...Good to know," she said, giggling again, as she calmed down. The sky was mending. The cracks were receding. "No judgement here either but...Boy am I glad you aren't, because I don't know if I could have taken that leap. Not that I think you'd ever ask me to do something I found uncomfortable. You're very gentle about that...I like that. And I'm sure there's more than a few things about that...intimate side of things that we have to talk about, too...But...For now, well, you're the one holding us in this trance. It's up to you to pull us out of it." Sure it was the piece of Star in them that let them do it, but Ellesandra was holding it, probably without realizing they were. Which probably felt odd. Doing something but not knowing they were, and needing to actively focus on undoing it. But, there it was.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smiled at the confirmation that Star wasn't interested in that. The giggles from Star put Ellesandra in a better mood, even if her own heart was still...not fully mended. It was good, and she was trying - that's all that mattered. Those shadowed would always live in her, she was pretty confident. Ellesandra nodded about not asking Star to do something she wasn't comfortable with, muttering - "Sex is supposed to be something both partners enjoy. If someone isn't into something, it's vital that is shared." Auramancy made this unnecessary a lot of the time, but Ellesandra still felt the need to ask. She didn't exactly know how to interpret Star's aura like Star did hers, plus there was something validating about getting a verbal 'yes' to something. It couldn't be misconstrued or misinterpreted. It was a full consent to do something. When told she was the one holding this trance in, she blinked and looked up, then around. "Really?" Ellesandra had assumed it had been Star doing it, since it was something within her of Star's that had encouraged her to start it to begin with. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, focusing on pulling out of the trance. And when she did, she pulled her hand away from Star's chest, back to rest on her own lap. She looked...sheepish, for running off and putting the barrier up so strongly. But she also felt like she needed to, for her own personal safety at the time. Still, it obviously hadn't been the right reaction, and there was guilt that she'd caused all of this.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star awoke from the trance when Ellesandra did. Having been out cold earlier, this was an improvement. Looking at her aura, it was whole again, though there was some fragility to it that Ellesandra would be able to discern, not by any specific quality, but just from feeling. Auramancy worked that way more often than not. She looked at her lover, who was naked, and wore a weak smile. She moved to sit up, then pulled Ellesandra into a tender hug. "...It's all going to be all right, Ella. I love you."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked down at her naked form, considering moving to go put clothes on - but then Star moved to pull her into a hug. Ellesandra responded, eyes closed and leaning into the embrace for a moment, then tensing when Star called her Ella again, and said that she loved her. She took a few, deep breaths, hands moving to rest on Star's back. It wasn't easy, Star would be able to tell. It felt like there was a frog in her throat, preventing her from speaking. But after a few moments, and trying, she whispered in response - barely audibly. "I love you too, Star." There was fear, with saying those words. Admitting them outside of the trance, outside of just inside of her head. They were fully true - it wasn't fear that she was lying or didn't know her emotions or something. But admitting it, out loud, meant opening herself up to the potential hurt it would involve. Acknowledging it, and letting it live in the open, was vulnerable. She held Star for a long moment after saying it, her body tensing as if being prepared to brace for Star pushing her away. She wasn't actually, though. She pulled back, took a deep breath...and kissed Star. Softly, tenderly, but passionately all the same. Not a bruising kiss, but similar to those of last night. Loving.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt them trying. It meant that much more to her to have Ellesandra say it knowing it was in overcoming their fears. The two things were separate, of course, but it felt nice to feel them trying. It reinforced her desire to try that much more for them, however she could. She was not going to release, though she also was just about to go in for a kiss. Doing so, she pulled back at the same time as Ellesandra, then realized they had the same intent. She smiled, scrunching her nose at that small shared moment of identical desire, then leaned into the kiss when it came. She kissed just as lovingly, happy to pour all her love into this affectionate gesture. No spice or fire to it - there were other things to focus on right now. Just love. And when that kiss broke, she gave another soft smile to them. She didn't want to let them go, and wouldn't. Really, Ellesandra was going to have to gently pull away if they wanted to get dressed. She wasn't going to make a fuss if they did, but she also was just...A little lost, looking into their eyes.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra let the gentleness of the kiss sink into her. To help assuage the fears, even if just a little. They would never get rid of them totally - but the reassurance of Star's love, currently, helped. She finally pulled away from it, smiling as Star just seemed...lost in her eyes. She let the moment last for longer than it needed to, to just hold Star, before finally pulling away and moving to stand. She sighed, not really wanting to get on with things - but they needed to. "I'm starving, and we still need to get ready. Go shower, I'll change and order some food for us. Meet me downstairs after your shower?" In reality, there was a stirring of arousal. A desire to join Star in the shower, but...now wasn't the time. Another time, yes, they would shower together. Get dirty, and then clean eachother off. The intimacy of that was definitely something Ellesandra looked forward to, and she was sure Star would enjoy that whenever it happened. After last night though, and the energy she'd spent through with haste - even if Sapphire had all but healed her up through it - demanded food. As if happy it was finally being identified, there was a loud gurgling coming from Ellesandra's stomach, considering they had kind of skipped dinner and burned a lot of calories another way last night, too.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded to the other's words. She did need to shower. Or, well, didn't NEED to but it would help. Her clothes were plenty clean. Spooky auramancy and arcane cleanliness resumed being a thing because they were no longer in Myst. She leaned in to kiss Ellesandra once more, a quick peck this time, before moving to shower. The blueberry pie that Ellesandra had bought was still sitting on the desk, uncovered. It wouldn't be spoiled, but it certainly was no longer bakery fresh. Downstairs, in the tavern, Amelia and Amara could be seen waiting at one of the tables. Ricca was behind the bar, idle and calm. The sun shone through the windows. Father Copia was sitting at one of the tables towards the corner, looking pensive. Even if things weren't really normal for Ellesandra or Father Copia, there was solace in that...For everyone else, it looked like it was just another day. Like Sapphire promised. The giggling of those village children could be heard as they played with each other outside. One of them was tagged, but the evidence they had to the contrary was 'nuh uh', and it was really hard to argue that, honestly.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra enjoyed the brief peck, watching Star head out to shower. She glanced at the leftover pie, and at least moved to cover it up, having forgotten about it during the night's....activities. It might not be fresh, but it would still be edible later if Star wanted a snack. She headed back down to the tavern room and glanced around, checking in on things. She was a little surprised to see Amara and Amelia sitting around waiting, having assumed they'd have come up to the room to knock on the door when they got here. She didn't press, just gave a nod in their direction and glanced around. Ricca seemed fine, and then there was the Father. A moment of indecision, but then she moved up to him. She knocked lightly on the table, a gentle way to bring him out of his pensiveness if he hadn't already noticed her approaching him. "Forgive me Father. I was wondering if you'd like to join me and my companions? Star is showering and will be right down." Her head tilted towards the table with Amelia and Amara. "I think I have some information I can share in regards to some of the...happenings overnight, that you might find of interest at least. Whether those details get shared with the rest of the town - well. I'd leave that up to you."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The Father looked up at Ellesandra, then nodded softly. "Ah, Ellesandra, wasn't it?" he asked, then eased up out of his seat. He was drinking tea. "Could I trouble you to carry the pot along?" he asked, taking his teacup. The pot was still slightly hot, but had a handle. But it seemed the father needed both hands for his tea to hold it steady. Assuming Ellesandra was in a helpful mood, he joined them along to the other table. "I'm curious why you leave that decision up to me, Miss. If I understand what I saw correctly, and what the emissary of Eldath said to me right, then we are, all of us, in your debt."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra would of course, take the pot by the handle with her left hand. With her right, she couldn't promise she wouldn't shake just a little if it was overbalanced or anything. Walking over to Amelia and Amara, who were probably confused and/or concerned at hearing the Father's statement, she shook her head and set the teapot down on the table for him. "I wasn't sure what you would remember, Sapphire wasn't clear on how much you would. But considering the potential trauma of remembering it, I leave it up to a local to make that decision of sharing it." She glanced to Amelia and Amara, nodding. "Good morning, glad to see you back here. Once Star is down and we have some food in front of us, I'll catch everyone up on what happened. Can I get you two anything ordered while we wait?" Ellesandra was being extra...polite. It was more a matter of her nerves and not knowing how to handle the situation with the Father being there too. Nerves about reliving it, and sharing that it was their fault the town had been in danger to begin with. She'd glance over to Ricca, then back to Amelia and Amara, prepared to go order food for them as well if they wanted anything. If not, she'd just get two basic breakfast platters for her and Star, along with some hot cocoa for herself and some orange juice for Star. If there was an option of fruits on the side, she got it for Star.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Sapphire? Was that her name?" he asked. He hadn't been given a name, but it did seem to be quite the pious thing for him to receive the name. Something he would keep to himself, regardless. He joined the others at the table, though it was a table for four. Amara, seeing that this would be an issue, moved to grab a chair from one of the other tables to adjust the seating so that she and Amelia were seated close, and the other chairs were...More or less equidistant. Amelia gave Amara a weird look for this, but Amara just smiled and planted a hand on Amelia's head, rubbing it tenderly, which just made Amelia pout more. "Perhaps it best be remembered as a bad dream but...I'll hear out what you have to tell," he said, gently nodding. "We ate in Myst before coming, no worries there," said Amara. Ellesandra would unfortunately find that their attempts to speak to Ricca in common were failing them, however. Ricca just tilted her head. The spell was no longer translating for Ellesandra. Father Copia, seeing this, moved up to step in to translate, so that things could progress along and Ricca could get to making the food while they waited at the table. Star would be along not too long after, freshly showered with hair damp and tied up in a ponytail. Never did get around to those braids. Oh well. She moved to take a seat with Ellesandra, holding Ellesandra's hand under the table, if they let her.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked confused at first, when Ricca didn't understand her. And then it clicked. She blushed, realizing her folly, but luckily Father Copia came to her rescue. She offered him a soft thanks and a sheepish smile to Ricca in apology, before heading back to the table. She would offer Father Copia an arm, if it looked like he needed it, but she didn't assume so. Upon getting back, she eyed the two closer chairs between Amelia and Amara curiously. She still felt like there was something there, even if they didn't say so publicly. When Star arrived, she allowed the hand holding, squeezing it gently, then looking around the table. Ellesandra took a deep breath, before starting - at least on that she could tell before the food would arrive. She wanted to keep the parts that she didn't want a waitress or Ricca to overhear - even if Ricca couldn't understand her - to after the food had arrived. "Before I explain everything that happened on our end last night - Amelia, Amara, is it safe to assume you ran into issues with the teleportation back here, and also communication?" She looked to them, wanting to ensure that nothing else other than frustration of travel and such happened to them. And it would be the safer bit to talk about to start with.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia and Amara ignored the looks. Was there something there? Who knows. Star, maybe. But she wouldn't be telling even if she did. The question was met with a nod from them both. "We came back to Gurhal, but we were somewhere totally wrong. Went back to Myst and tried again, we were somewhere else. We did that for the better part of the night, then said screw it and we'd try again in the morning. Tried to use Sending, but it just...failed. Like it hit a wall or something, and fizzled out." No ringing for Amelia, it seemed, as she explained it. She'd definitely mention, and complain, about that. "Seems everything is fine this morning though, so I'm guessing one of your eight thousand million billion enemies decided to do something awful after we left?" asked Amelia, her attitude not really able to hide the clear concern in her voice. She was trying to be tough, but she was worried, looking at Ellesandra. A bit unusual for her to wear her emotions so openly, but they were certainly there.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to the information, having expected the portal just went somewhere random, or didn't work at all. The comment about one of their enemies doing something awful though - Ellesandra glanced to Father Copia quietly, then back to Amelia and nodded. The guilt was evident to Star - the fact that they had endangered the town just by being there. Even if there was a tentative promise not to do it again, it was still a concern. "Yes. After going to sleep last night, I was faced with the doors like I told you about before. I chose to go have a conversation with Sapphire, to see if we could get any information or leads on how to best deal with Valentina or her cult following. During the course of that conversation, Sapphire seemed to sense that something was wrong here, and pushed me to wake up. There was a sleep spell over Star and I - and I'm not sure if it was my magical resistance that helped me wake, or if Sapphire alone is the only reason I was able to wake up." She looked at Star, adding. "Sapphire also made it clear that waking you up would be a bad idea. Valentina arrived later, which is why. So that's why you weren't brought into this at all." And then she turned to look at Amelia. "And this is the first time I attempted to contact you, and I just got back a high pitched ringing. I assumed it was being magically blocked, considering the danger." Ellesandra would pause here, looking around and waiting until the food was delivered before she continued, so as to not be interrupted. Only after it arrived did she let go of Star's hand, but this was only done so she could hold her mug of cocoa in both hands and bring it close. The comfort of it obviously needed; Ellesandra's emotions and guilt were...strong right now. The fear that this could have happened to the people of Neet, or other people on their journey. She would wait for questions so far, to ensure she answered what she could before proceeding.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was naturally going to ask why she wasn't woken, but, of course, Ellesandra was ahead of that, so she said nothing. The guilt was there, too. The notion of Ellesandra facing all of whatever happened alone was...No, she didn't like that. Obviously Ellesandra survived but...To think she could just sleep through them dying? No, no she did not like that, not one bit, and Ellesandra could tell she was very bothered about all of this already. Not that it was the knight's fault. They made all the right decisions. She was just...Scared. The food arrived in proper order, the cocoa was fresh and extra smooth. A pleasant aroma, if ever there was one, for a heart in need of comforts. "So. You went face to face with the enemy, but you clearly aren't dead. I take it from the state of things this morning that things ended in our favour?" asked Amara, making use of 'our' to highlight their camaraderie.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shrugged to Amara. There was the feeling of discomfort with the whole situation from Star, how much she didn't like it, so Ellesandra reached over and lightly squeezed her shoulder. Trying to reassure her it was okay, before bringing her hand back to the mug. She sipped it, staring down at the plate of food in front of her. Her stomach growled, but... "When I got downstairs, Ri-..our bartender was slumped over the bar with blood coming out of her mouth, eyes, and ears." She glanced at Father Copia again, trying to gauge how much of this he remembered. She also didn't mention her nudeness, since she didn't feel like it was necessary to reveal all that her and Star had been intimate that night. "Outside was Sylvia and...apparently, Willow, though I didn't know she was there until after Sapphire arrived." A pause, then she clarified. "Two of Valentina's captains. Sylvia was the scythe wielding one you saw yesterday." She added to the other three. Star would also have seen the last bit of the sentence, about not knowing Willow had been there, was a lie. It was a lie for Father Copia, since she wanted to ensure word of her ability to sense the shadows, and thus Willow, didn't somehow get spread. "Sylvia was standing guard around a red crystal, which had the magic that was seeping life force from everyone in the town. It wasn't working on Star or I, because this was meant as a message. Specifically...to me. That continuing on this path would get others killed. Innocents." She spoke softly, but Star would be able to feel it. The guilt. It had hit exactly where Valentina had intended, even if Ellesandra had been able to prevent the worst from happening. "Many villagers were out, just face down on the ground, dying. Not making a sound, it was...eerily quiet." Her fingers tightened on the mug, remembering the kids. She looked up, out the window at the kids playing tag in the distance, and she didn't need to say it for Star to tell the lurch in her heart that she was remembering seeing them. Even if she hadn't seen them until after it was over, she'd still seen them. "By the time I got to Sylvia and was talking to her, trying to plan an attack on the crystal which seemed to be causing this, the Father here came out and attacked. Did something that stirred up all the red, blood dust in the area. Father Copia, I can't tell you how much that helped. It distracted her and gave me the opportunity to get to the crystal and destroy it. Sylvia is far beyond any of our skill levels, and would have wiped the ground with me if I'd tried to pass her without that distraction." She paused for a moment, then added. "I am sorry, though. I think the shockwave of destroying the crystal knocked you out. And then Sylvia proceeded to do exactly what I described. I was inches away from losing an arm when Sapphire arrived and shot her with an arrow that burnt her to ash and killed her. This is also when Willow attacked Sapphire, but Sapphire is..." She paused, then looked at the rest of the group. "On or around Valentina's power level. Willow didn't stand a chance and ran off. I didn't get a good look at her." Also a lie, but she also wasn't sure how much this story might spread, and if it spread to Willow she wanted her to have the impression that Ellesandra hadn't really seen her. "And then Valentina did in fact show up. Sapphire and her had an argument, I stood there awkwardly while two deity level women threw hissy fits at eachother, and then Valentina agreed to stay out of our way and let us deal with the cult of faust ourselves, without her involvement, to see if we're able to defeat them. And then Sapphire healed me from the injuries Sylvia gave me, and then the rest of the town from the magic, and wiped their memories so they'd all think it was a dream." Ellesandra was obviously summarizing quickly at the end there, trying to just get done with it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had a lot of pulses of reaction on her aura for Ellesandra to feel. Trust that they were lying for a good reason, specifically. Obviously Star didn't like lying, but she also knew Ellesandra was a good person. That they had a very good reason to do so. It's not as though she thought there was never a good reason to lie, of course. The trust came with support. An acknowledgement of what was lied about, so she would know what the real story was, but also that she would keep up that lie with them if needed. Father Copia gave a solemn nod. "T'is Eldath's will that peace be paramount. You fine folk have proven peaceful, despite your arms. Thus you are welcomed. Those others brought needless death, and so I wrought Eldath's vengeance upon them, as best my ailing body and spirit could. It takes more than what they gave to subdue this old man," he said with a warm smile given to Ellesandra. He looked well for his age, and didn't quite fit the 'old man' image he was describing, but he certainly was a bit older. "It'll take more than a little tumble as well to keep me down, worry not, Miss." He then paused to sip his tea. Amelia looked at Amara, who looked back at them, then there was a pause to consider things. "So then. Valentina is staying out of our way. I assume that just means her and her goonies, not the others who we'll run into along the way?" clarified Amara. Indeed, there was more than just the Apostles of Faust. There was also the Cult of the Black Diamond, who would not sit idle. Valentina herself, and her three thralls, were the only ones stepping out of the arena. Star looked to sink into deep thought on the matter. Amara continued, once the clarification was given: "...So what say you, then, Ellesandra? Sounds like you know the most of what happened, and you know the most about our enemy. The truth is valuable, but...Given how strong the enemy is, is there any point in instilling that fear? It sounds like these people will be left alone, regardless."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Despite what Father Copia said, Ellesandra didn't feel peaceful. She felt fully at fault for bringing this harm upon them. It hadn't been specifically mentioned, but she knew the reason that this example was shown was for her, specifically. Her presence alone was what brought that danger to these innocents. To break her, and reminder her that her failure to protect Marigold had led to her death. And would lead to the death of other innocents. Ellesandra would nod to Amara, clarifying as needed that it included those serving Valentina, and it was just her and the captains who would be stepping out. "As far as we can trust her word, that is. And while I suspect she'll play by the rules for a time at least, I don't trust she won't act if we get too close to finding Aurora, or making a difference against her own followers." If Valentina had been preparing and building this movement for a millennia to take down the gods, she wasn't likely to just sit back because Sapphire said so when a handful of mortals threatened those plans. She sat her mug down and reached for some food, only taking a bite before putting it back down. She was both hungry, but also had no appetite thinking about all of this. "It's traumatic, and especially for the kids. I don't see any benefit to their lives, for them to remember it. Maybe to be more on guard, to potentially be prepared if she does attack again, but for a small town out here? The only reason she did was because I was here." Ellesandra shifted uncomfortably at that admission. "So I wouldn't, personally. But again, up to you Father Copia."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Father Copia gently shook his head. "Nay. You and I are in agreement on the matter. But it was still important I leave that decision to you," said the priest. "There were no wrong answers. But this one lets the people of Neet rest more easily, at least." One more nod to affirm the position. He then sipped from his tea some more. Star placed a hand on Ellesandra's thigh. "You need to eat, Ella," she whispered, her concern for them clear, even if it was rife with sympathies for the pain she could feel and see in them. Of course it was hard. Of course they were suffering. But Ellesandra would say the same, to her. It was important to eat now. To stay strong. "They are the tactics of terror," said Amara, her words firm, but sympathetic. "To break an enemy not by directly fighting them, but by targeting innocent people? It's what cowards and evil people do. That you bear remorse for it shows your heart is wide and tender, soldier. But giving into it is exactly what the enemy wants. I know that doesn't make it easier but...Just remember what your enemy is willing to do next time you get a chance to fight back. Fight that much harder. With that much more ferocity. Because we're not just fighting for ourselves. We're fighting against a clear and present evil. We won't count on the honour of our enemy. But if they are giving us a period of peace at least? Then let us waste no time in capitalizing on it. And if you need time to center yourself, none here will blame you. Lives hanging in the balance make decisions as hard as they can possibly be, so let us face them together. We've secured a large sum of coin. Serenity is sympathetic to this plight, and while it is obviously too risky now to go back to Myst to resupply lest we get separated more permanently, well..." Amara leaned forward onto the table here, supported by one elbow. "Mistake not my calm demeanor for indifference to the vile sin of targeting the innocent. We will make them all pay, Ellesandra. Together."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She looked at her food, shaking her head at the idea of eating more, but she did reach for it. She also glanced to make sure Star had eaten too, considering she'd probably have been listening pretty intently during the storytelling time. Ellesandra took small bites, enough to satisfy that she was eating but not what she would normally take. Her stomach gurgled, her eyes on Amara at her speech. It was rousing, and inspiring, and - it just didn't have the effect it normally would on Ellesandra. Normally, Ellesandra would have enjoyed it - being talked to like a soldier, or guard again. Being encouraged like that. Now? She just nodded. She didn't really feel that she agreed, knowing that no matter how hard they fought it wouldn't prevent the death of other innocents, but it didn't mean Ellesandra was going to stop fighting. She continued to eat, one hand on the mug of cocoa as if the warmth itself comforted her. After finishing the bit of food she'd picked up initially, she spoke again. "And just because they've agreed to back off now doesn't mean we shouldn't prepare for them doing something similar in the future. So we should consider the safety of people we stay with, inns and taverns and towns the like. It might not make sense everywhere, but resting outside of city limits or away from civilized areas might help ensure no threat comes to innocents there. I was lucky, not only in that I happened to be talking with Sapphire at the time of the attack, but also because of the Father here, I was able to get past Sylvia. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm pretty sure she could have taken all of us without breaking a sweat. I don't want to rely on luck in the future."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Everyone certainly noticed that the rousing declaration had fallen flat. Star and Amara most of all, of course. Star had a pang of worry in her. She obviously didn't enjoy seeing Ellesandra distraught. It hurt her, though not in an exactly negative way. Her lover was suffering deep down. And while that wasn't exactly new, this was a new source of that suffering. Star just wanted to pull her love into a cuddle and cradle them for days on end. She wouldn't be able to do that, so...She just squeezed their thigh tenderly and let her worries flow into them. Her care. Her concern. Her affections and desires to help and make them smile, genuinely. Still, there were small nods of agreement. "There's comforts in the warmth of the campfire under a starlit night anyway," said Amara, not letting that her conviction fell flat deter her. Took more than that to break a paladin's will. "Right, Amelia?" she asked, earning a scoff from Amelia. "No," she said, unashamed in her honesty. "But I'll sleep in a goblin cage that's five sizes too small if it'll keep people safe. Ellesandra saying we can't rely on luck might be the smartest thing she's ever said." It was a compliment. Probably..
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra put a hand down on Star's own hand on her thigh, Squeezing lightly. An attempt to reassure her that she was fine. Well, 'fine'. Certainly things were less than ideal, but she would live through them. There was some relief and gratitude when both Amara and Amelia confirmed they were fine sleeping out under the stars. She'd been a little afraid they'd refuse, or claim that it was their enemies fault and not theirs and they shouldn't give up comforts or something like that. Or that it was foolish, since it would put them in more danger. She nodded, eventually, and looked to Amelia to give her a mock glare. "You mean when I told Star last night that you are the smartest of our group and that I'd bow to your intelligence wasn't the smartest thing I said?" Ellesandra was playing dirty - she was complimenting Amelia now. From what she'd seen before, Amelia didn't tend to take these as easily as someone who truly brushed off compliments would. While the actual statement was playfully false - she hadn't told Star this - the idea was true. She wasn't quite sure if Amelia was smarter than Star or Amara, but she certainly was intelligent and that was the intent behind the compliment. Slowly, Ellesandra reached for some more food, also chewing it slowly, but forcing down what she could right now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a divided reaction in Amelia. On one hand, she flushed red in the cheeks and pouted. On the other? "T-Tch! Y-Yeah, and then you put your foot in your mouth and did a one-legged backflip over the tavern, right? Or was it instead that you sucked in half the air in the whole realm to keep up how big of a blowhard you are?" Fussy pout? Check. Arms crossed? Check. Defiant 'hrmph'? Check. Amara chuckled. "Don't be a brat, Amelia. I don't mind telling you that you're the smartest among the Crusaders at least," she said, her tone tender and motherly. Amelia's ears flattened against the top of her head at that, defusing her a bit and making her lips wobble. Star was smiling as she quietly observed, but offered nothing more. A warm happiness was in her aura, at the scene and at Ellesandra squeezing her hand, and her seeing Ellesandra still trying to eat. That squeeze turned into a reassuring little rub, hopeful to encourage them to keep at it. Star had finished her own food at this point, not having been talking much. Amara then looked at Ellesandra again. "So, where does that leave us? With what happened last night, do you need a day to rest before we head out to follow the lead on the airship?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched Amelia seem to deflate at Amara's words. her words were mostly ignored, only raising one eyebrow at Amelia in amusement at how hard she was trying. There was a comment to be made there - one about Ellesandra being talented at sucking - but considering what had happened last night, she wasn't sure how comfortable Star would be with her making it. So instead, she watched silently, glancing over to Star at the rubbing, and then just continuing to eat a little more until Amara asked her a question again. Ellesandra tilted her head from one side to the next, stretching it and popping it lightly. Her muscles were a little sore, but nothing like they would have been after using haste like that if it hadn't of been for Sapphire, and this strange increased aura power she got from Star now. Normally she would have been knocked on her ass for a day or two after going so hard with the haste, and it hurt her pride knowing that even going that hard she was still no match for Sylvia's speed, but at the very least it hadn't seemed to have as big of an effect on her. "I'm a little sore, surprisingly not nearly as bad as I'd expected to be. Sapphire's healing did wonders, which itself is a feat considering how hard it is to heal past my magical resistance. Then again, she healed the entire town with a wave of her hand so..." Ellesandra shrugged. Deity like powers, didn't need to question them. "I'm fine to continue today. And no offense Father Copia, your town is lovely, but I would rather not potentially endanger you all any more than we already have. Thank you for not just running us out of town after that." Ellesandra still obviously felt at fault for what happened, but she wasn't going to focus too much on that. She grabbed one last piece of bacon then pushed the rest of her plate to the side, in case Star wanted to eat any off of it, and pulled her mug of cocoa to her to sip on. Bacon and cocoa was not a particularly common or pleasant mix, but it worked for her. "So, our plan is to travel to this friend of the Father's and talk to him about potentially an airship, then. If on the way we happen to encounter that beast that has been haunting your area Father, I think we agreed we'd look into it, but I'm afraid it doesn't make sense for us to go out of our way to hunt it if we don't happen near it. Unless you already know where it nests?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Father Copia rose a brow at the knight. He had been content sipping his tea and not interjecting, but the comment had him then knitting his brow in confusion. "Run you out of town..? Dear knight, from what I do understand and remember of the night, we may very well all have died if not for you. While I understand it had been the machinations of an evil person hunting you and yours, it begs not only to be said that you cannot be held accountable for the actions of evil, yet also bears insisting that you must truly be of a kind heart and noble soul to acquire the ire of such evils. Take it from this old priest...It is those who do the greatest good that paint the largest targets upon their skin for evil-doers. But, as for the crimson beast, well. It has a nest to the southwestern forest. A bit out of your way, I'm afraid, as your travels will lead you north. But I'm sure we will manage something, somehow. Starting with ensuring that Keiko goes out with an escort from now on."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra seemed to shrug off his words about her being some sort of great good. He didn't know her - or her past sins. If she had been so good, then why did she let those around her get hurt? A glance was given to star, but she distracted herself by taking a bite of the bacon. The knowledge that this beast nested in the south while they were travelling north was unfortunate - she had been hoping they'd have an excuse to take care of the beast without going too far out of their way. With that not being an option though, she made a mental note to bring it up in this next city. Potentially, the tax man just wasn't sharing the concern and it was less a lack of care from the guard or kingdom forces overall, and more just a lazy tax worker. "Got it. Well, was there anything else we needed before we set out, if we are all ready to set out today?" She glanced around at the group. "I think we're good on supplies for the length of the journey, unless there was anything else we felt we needed to get. Star has access to her magical storage again, so she's got a nice large tent in there." Ellesandra added, since it was obvious Star wasn't exactly carrying around a lot of her own supplies.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was mildly concerned by Ellesandra's refusal at the encouragement, but this was also not anything new, so she just gave another little squeeze. Now that the two had their love in the open, Star had no reservations with her touch. Outside of social grace, obviously. Much as she had an underlying, ever-present urge to just throw herself at Ellesandra and kiss them for the next eighty trillion years, then maybe have a break for cocoa for getting back to it, she also wasn't sure how much Ellesandra liked public affections. Nor did she know if they wanted to spill the beans to the other two. But she also refused to fall in line with the thinking that Ellesandra not outright saying 'hey by the way we fucked last night' to their companions was evidence that they were somehow ashamed of it or didn't want their relationship to be public. So. She just made a note to ask about it when a good time came up, rather than get caught up in the new-love nerves that, unknown to her, befell so many. Star had a regretful longing in her heart. They had agreed that they had to focus on their mission, and that meant leaving people behind and not helping everyone but...It still obviously wasn't something she liked. Ellesandra could feel that, but also the acceptance of what they had to do. Obviously, Star wasn't objecting, so, she didn't need to be reminded that their mission was paramount. Father Copia reached into his robes and produced a small letter, sealed with his personal wax stamp. He held it out for Ellesandra. "I had to rewrite it after last night's events," he said pleasantly. "I'm certain it will serve you well with my dear friend." That letter, as well as the general nods of acknowledgement from Amara and Amelia, seemed to confirm that they were ready to go. "We've secured ten thousand gold from the guild for this. And that sounds like a lot, because, well, it is. But understand there's an expectation that much of that will be used for acquiring unique things from the realm to bring back," said Amara. "And as we don't know how long this will take, we'll want to be mindful of how we use it." For four people, that certainly was a massive amount of coin, but it was also true that on the scale of kingdoms as large as the ones in Gurhal, it could be eaten up very quickly if they let it.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked at the letter that was offered, and took it. A moment of curiosity passed where she considered opening it to read it, but then turned and handed it to Star instead for her to place in her magical sleeves of safekeeping. "Might be safest with you, for now." Was all she had to say towards that before she turned back to look at Amara and Amelia. Ten thousand gold was...definitely a lot. Certainly more than she had expected, though if it was going to be used to buy unique things from the realm to bring back as well, that might make sense. Specific magical items and such could probably eat up a large amount of that gold. "Understood. We also still have a decent amount of gold from Morrin, which should help to just cover living expenses for a while as long as we aren't going out of our way to eat like nobles." She took a deep breath, and then finished off her piece of bacon before moving to stand, then. "I've left something back in the room to grab, but if there's nothing else then we can get going?" She made the question of the group, wanting to ensure that no one else needed to do anything before leaving. Really, Ellesandra hadn't left any of her personal items back, but she didn't want to leave the pie there on the counter. Either she'd give it to Star to keep in her magical storage until later for eating, or she'd bring it down to Ricca to share out for free with guests or eat herself. Either way, Ricca shouldn't have to clean it up herself just because they'd left it there and not eaten it all.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The letter was taken by Star, and off it went into magical who-knows-where. It was best to leave it closed; Star might have stopped them from opening it if they tried, for a seal on a letter once broken was cause for distrust in the recipient. Things were all in agreement from the party, who rose up. "Well hurry up then, would'ya?" said Amelia, folding her arms as she moved with Amara to the exit of the tavern where they would wait just outside. Amara smirked. "We'll meet you out front," she said, giving Star and Ellesandra some privacy. Star smiled at her companion, not sure what Ellesandra forgot but pleased to go up to the room with them to help them with whatever it is. Though once they were up in the room, a surprise secret motive was revealed! A kiss on the cheek. "So, erm...I'll just come out and say that I uhm...I'd like to tell our companions about our relationship." Outward, honest, unashamed of being an item with Ellesandra. "But I figured I should make sure you're okay with that first..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra rolled her eyes at Amelia, and gave Father Copia a low nod as she departed in respect. When they got up to the room and Star moved to her to give her a cheek kiss, and then request to share their relationship with their companions, Ellesandra's heart beat a little faster. On the one hand, she enjoyed the attention and that Star wanted to share this - it meant she was relatively serious about it at least, and that made Ellesandra happy and...loved. On the other hand, it made it more official, and that was scary. She watched Star for a moment, and then reached to pull her in by the waist, gentle, and leaned in to brush her lips against Star's. Just briefly, a small kiss, which if Star allowed it would lead into one a bit more intimate. Knowing that this wasn't exactly something they might do a lot in the travels, she wanted to take the time to kiss Star properly, to just...feel their bodies together. After a few breathless moments, she pulled away and closed her eyes. There was still fear there, but for right now Ellesandra was ignoring it. "I don't mind if they know. Do me a favor and wait until you see Amelia drinking from her waterskin or something, and then just kiss me fully. See if we can make her spit her drink out." Ellesandra grinned a little evily at that. "Or grab my ass. Well - not through armor. But something that would surprise her." She truly was okay with them knowing, but if they were going to share the information anyways why not do so in a way that would cause humor? Ellesandra let go of Star, pulling away and moving to the pie, then holding the covered pastry up for Star. "Is this something you'd like to keep in your magical pocket sleeves or shall I bring it down for Ricca to have? I didn't want to just leave it here. And -" She said, being reminded by mentioning Ricca about how her previous conversation attempt failed. "Would you mind casting the language spell on me again? Just in case we encounter anyone else today that speaks only Gurhalian."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled upon feeling the love. Yes, that was what she liked. There was no hesitation in her heart. Nothing that would stop her from being open and honest about her love for Ellesandra, as she was with all things that were true to her heart. She had become painfully aware of how words would not suffice to help Ellesandra see how her heart had room only for them, so she supposed she'd just have to live the rest of her life with them and when they were both pushing into their final years she could lean over and just say 'I told you so'. That thought aside, she was being kissed. Yes, please, said her aura, and then her lips, and then arms as they wrapped around Ellesandra's neck. There was no 'allowing' Ellesandra to be more intimate. If anything, they would have to stop her from escalating it. Ellesandra and Amelia having to wait an hour while they stripped and made love again was a real danger. But, one that was avoided. This time. Her lips tingled, and she bit into her lower lip as they pulled away, her heart now pounding happily in her chest. The euphoria that she felt wafted off her. Ellesandra made her feel that. Nobody else. Her eyes opened again when Ellesandra laid out the plan, and Star giggled. "She brings out quite the little troublemaker in you, doesn't she?" she asked with levity and tenderness in her tone. "All right, all right, I'll watch for my moment, and make a show of it." The release from the hug was met with some mild reluctance. It always would, though. Of course she didn't want to let go. But, they had stuff to do. How troublesome. She eyed the pie with a genuine desire to just eat the whole thing like a gremlin with her hands right that moment. But...She shook her head. "Let's give it to Ricca, put some more positivity into this place. I'll get another chance somewhere else to enjoy one." A smile. Then a look of surprise. "Oh! Uh. Right. Whoops." Seemed she forgot as well. So, she set about casting the spell on Ellesandra again with ease, and once more for the day to come, Ellesandra would be able to speak to others. "I'll see if I can't figure out a way to extend the duration of that...Something that can last until it's cancelled, preferably."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

How much Star wanted it...did things to Ellesandra. There was a brief moment where she, too, considered making Amelia and Amara wait. She didn't, however. With the spell being cast on her again and confirmation of what to do with the pie, she nodded. "Thank you. That would be ideal, but don't stress yourself out or tax your energy trying that, love." She tested out the nickname for Star again. She'd said it in the trance but - that had been during a heated, emotional moment. Saying it now had an obvious fear effect on Ellesandra, immediately being concerned about whether or not Star would dislike that or be upset about being called it. Not wanting to see how the nickname actually landed, she was already out the door with the pie and heading downstairs to Ricca, who she walked up to with a pleasant smile on her face. "Good morning Ricca. I apologize for the confusion earlier. We have a bit of leftover pie from yesterday, and don't have a convenient way to bring it with us as we start our travels today. I thought you would enjoy it, or could share it out with customers as they come in if not?" She set the pie on the table, actively not looking towards Star but just focusing on Ricca. Because even if Star's response was positive, Ellesandra was nervous about it. A little afraid at once again admitting the depth of those feelings.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, for Ellesandra, avoiding looking at Star wasn't enough. Their auras were connected, so the moment Ellesandra said 'love', Star's heart swelled with love and affection and...a tiny bit of arousal. Just a tiny bit. The positive emotions wafting over them would take more than just running away to avoid, but Star, a little amused, let Ellesandra try to run. Star was going to get them back, and her head was already thinking of ways to do so. Star's aura gained a...mischievous, playful energy? It was good-natured of course. But maybe a tiny bit ominous. Ricca smiled, now able to understand Ellesandra. She giggled. "[Gurhalian] A bit of leftover? Hon, this is a whole pie," she said, drawing in a slow breath, then sighing. "You folk are too much...But I'll be happy to cut it up and share the treat. Thank you...For everything. Not often we get blessed company like yourselves here, but...Know that you and yours are welcome any time. And if you're headed out, at least let some of us see you off, won't you?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Yeah, Ellesandra would have to get used to the feel of Star's aura just being there. They didn't really talk about that, it was still something to bring up later. She wasn't sure how much Star would want to talk about that in front of Amelia or Amara, considering the way it started was a bit intimate. Star was comfortable sharing that they were a couple, but did she want to talk about their sexual activities in front of their companions? Ellesandra could probably get her to blush a lot that way, which would be cute. The mischievous and playful aura from Star was matched by Ellesandra as ideas ran through her mind. At Ricca's comment about it being a full pie, Ellesandra shrugged, looking over at Star next to her. "I gave her a different kind of pie last night instead." A wink was given to Star, obviously intending this as a lewd innuendo. If Star was comfortable with people knowing, she was going to have to get used to Ellesandra actively flirting with her in public then. With Amelia and Amara waiting outside of the tavern, there was no reason to keep it hidden for the sake of shock factor later. Turning back to Ricca, and hoping she didn't overstep any comfort lines with her at the comment either, she quickly added on her own question. "See us off? I don't think that'd be necessary? What would you be seeing us off for?" There was...true confusion there. If Ricca remembered or knew what had happened the previous night, she could see them maybe considering Ellesandra and their group as heroes to send off. But otherwise, they were just wealthy adventurers, who happened to help Keiko along the way. Not anything worth getting a sending off for.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"GHE--" came Star's response to that open remark. Surprise? Yes. Upset? No. Blush? Very yes. Submissive feelings and arousal also joined the mix. It only got worse, however, as Ricca blushed and looked to one side. Her ears flicked tellingly. "[Gurhalian] I, erm...Y-Yes. We all heard you." Sure, the rooms were private. But the walls were thin, it was not a super expensive tavern after all. And the sensitive ears on the heads of everyone who lived here? They might have been heard in more than just the tavern. "Some late night patrons made some jokes about how much to rent the rooms here," said Ricca with a giggle, nervous, but clearly not uncomfortable with the subject matter. The woman might be around the same age as the knight and Star themselves, by looks alone. She then cleared her throat as Star's face did its best tomato impression. "As for seeing you off? Well. You've all been nothing but kind and giving since you arrived. I heard the kids were a bit nervous, but they were talking about the 'cool knights' plenty. We don't get many visitors out in this part of the world, but it's because of that that people who do wander in can leave a real impression. Goodness knows it's just back to the same old slow and quiet life once you're all out of here. Just think of it as pure, honest, Sun-plane hospitality if it sets you at ease."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra enjoyed every moment of Star's blushing. She was grinning wide, though the submissive feelings being felt alongside the arousal was something she hadn't entirely expected. While she'd have guessed Star was generally more submissive, she hadn't been super submissive the night before - getting on top of Ellesandra and teasing her the way she had. She noted that information for later, a little bit of her own arousal sparking simply in response to noticing this from Star. And then Ricca added more about hearing them and Ellesandra pursed her lips together to stop herself from laughing. She'd considered that last night after hearing Star be loud, but it hadn't come back up for her until Ricca mentioned it. The idea that people outside of the tavern itself had heard it just made her comment lead to all the more blushing by Star, and such a better response than Ellesandra would have guessed. Ellesandra on the other hand, didn't seem to mind at all that others had heard them. In fact, she gave Ricca a smug smirk. The idea that Star hadn't been able to help herself, and others had heard how good she'd felt...it was a point of pride, for Ellesandra. You could imagine how that might work when she was playing the field, making a name for herself in pleasuring other women. That was no longer the case of course, but she still felt the pride in it. "Well, I hope we didn't scar anyone too young with the noises. Just tell 'em we were fighting off scary dreams." And then, as to the sending off, Ellesandra glanced back out the window where the kids had previously been playing again. Even if they weren't there, she considered that. If a send off would be something the kids might enjoy, then...why not? She shrugged and nodded. "We're about to head out. Anything you need for it before we do then?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star took her time to readjust and calm down as the obvious sexual talk went on. She just lost her virginity, so she wasn't about to go flirting with that level of confidence, but she also did have history of being around people who were this brazen, namely her previous guardian. Ricca gave a wave of her hand to dismiss the notion. "They'd have been long asleep I'm sure. I'd say you'd learn what it's like to be about those of us with sensitive ears, but I'm getting the real sense you're not at all bothered about it all," she said, biting her lower lip a moment as she looked aside. Ellesandra wouldn't see in their aura, but might be able to pick up just on their body language that Ricca had a longing for a partner of her own. Obviously not looking at either of these two for that, but overhearing what had happened was enough to get her tail wagging behind her as she thought about a night with a strong, handsome fox man to make her make some of those noises. There'd be no cause for jealousy from Star, because Ricca had no attraction to other women in that way it seemed. Ricca moved along with a clear of her throat and shook her head. "Just thought we'd walk you to where the road leads off and wave you along. Say a proper goodbye, though hopefully not a forever sort." Another smile. She then moved along to get out from behind the bar and saw to join them along the way. She helped Father Copia up to stand, who chuckled. "Always a woman of the people, aren't you, Ricca? Can't have a single soul walk out of this place without a smile, can you?" he said, earning a modest smile from Ricca. "Whatever you say, Father. You're the one who helped me and pa when we were going hungry, weren't 'ya? Been meaning to tell 'ya that we got some money together to get your medicine cabinet restocked, too. And I won't hear a word of objection, you hear?" she said to the man, just speaking honestly to him without announcing it all. Of course, this naturally revealed what some of the good the extra money Ricca had come into was going to be used for, which did make Star's heart swell with happiness, affirming how good it was they could give a little coin to this place. There was another pang of regret they couldn't do more but...She reminded herself again that her mother was waiting for her, every second of every day might be critical. All said, the group was ready to move out of the tavern and join with Amelia and Amara. Star filled the others in that they were getting a sendoff, and as the group moved along, Ricca made a few hurried stops and knocks on a few doors to talk to some of the other townsfolk. It wasn't the whole settlement. But the baker, Father Verma, Keiko and presumably her husband and young child, and the other four children were among a handful of others who joined in a slow walk behind Ricca and Father Copia to the northern edge of the settlement, where the buildings stopped and the road continued onwards to the rolling fields beyond. It was the end of a chapter in Neet. Everyone was alive. People were happy, as could be seen as they all raised their arms up to give long, happy waves at the adventurers who forged onwards. Tragedy had been avoided. Though they still would have troubles to face in the weeks, months, and years to come, the good that had been done for the people would last in their minds and hearts. "Goodbye Missus Knight!" called out one of the small girls jovially, mirthful and giggling. Other goodbyes paired with those calls, and the townsfolk stayed at the border of the village for a little while longer before returning to their happy, peaceful lives, now touched by the kindness of the four who soldiered forward.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra understood Ricca's desire. The desire for an actual partner - she had it. She'd found it so far in Star, even if she couldn't let herself accept that Star would stay through it all. For now, she had it, and she'd take that. There was a confirmation that it didn't really bother her with a smirk, but she did look at Star to try to get an idea of how much it bothered Star. Perhaps covering her mouth in the future to prevent her from making too much noise was in order? She may or may not like that - worth figuring out in the future. The thought brought arousal, and her eyes scanned Star up and down once, remembering how she looked atop Ellesandra, before she turned back and forced her mind back on non-lewd thoughts. "Okay, thank you Ricca." She would wait for Ricca to be ready and then heading out of the tavern with her. While Star caught their companions up on what was happening, Ellesandra took a moment to look around and ensure nothing was happening of concern. No one was watching with suspicion, there was no feeling of shadows - that they were safe. As they walked out and the families joined, Ellesandra began to feel very...self-conscious. The attention, the thanking, she was uncomfortable with it. Star would be able to tell easily, though she had a relatively stoic mask on her face again. As the kids waved there was another shock of desire - not sexual, but just desire to have a child, to be part of their life. And then all of the thanking and waving and Ellesandra just felt entirely out of place. Like she didn't deserve this, and that they were mistaken. She did return the wave to the kids who did wave to her, though she made an assumption that most of them were referencing Amara in regards to miss knight. When they got out of town and the noise and people were behind them, Ellesandra let out a deep breath. "Can we not do that again in future towns? We don't want Amelia's head to get too big with false pride or something." A deflection, a way to get the focus off of how much she herself had actually disliked that, but to also express a general distaste for the attention they'd received.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star saw the discomfort, which made her feel a pang of sadness in turn. She believed they deserved that praise, the good sendoff. Mostly Ellesandra, as Star didn't do much beyond helping Keiko. Which wasn't nothing, but saving the whole village felt like a bigger achievement, not that it was a competition. Amara had been given smiles and waves back to the others. When Ellesandra spoke up, Amara was quick to reply: "We don't do that for us," she said, not mad or accusing, but firm in her conviction. "We do things like that to give people hope. To let them believe in good. In heroes. To inspire. One of those children might grow up to be the hero of that village someday. We can never know, but we can certainly try. If Amelia's head gets too big, I'll noogie her back down to size, won't I?" she asked, smirking as she looked at Amelia. Amelia just huffed and crossed her arms. "I don't know WHAT I did to be the target of all this, but you can all leave me the hell out of it! I don't need thanks, so long as the people are safe." Something Ellesandra might agree with more. Star giggled, for reasons unknown, but clearly amused by something. "People need heroes. And more than that, they need those heroes to be people they can know. People who they can just as easily see standing between them and scary monsters as they can see hauling a sack of grain over their shoulder to help them with their farm. I've traveled far in my role as captain and seen a lot of places like that. A little less furry, usually," she said with a chuckle. "Usually I'm the one who stands out, in fact. But all my modesty in the faces of thankful people has ever done is invalidate their gratitude. I don't do it for the thanks. Their hopeful eyes are thanks enough." Amara looked over at Ellesandra, smiling softly. She hadn't taken her 'captain' tone with them. None of these were orders. But there was a knowing quality to her expression. "Often, what people want to hear most when they say 'thank you' is just 'you're welcome'. We'll just have to work extra hard to keep Amelia's ego in check, right?" she asked, smirking. Amelia knit her brow more. "Wh- Still? Didn't I just say I don't give a crap?!"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra found a little bit of amusement at Amara offering to give Amelia a knuckle sandwich, but she took what Amara was saying seriously. She had a point, and Ellesandra gave her a silent nod. Understanding, even though she still didn't like the attention at all. Still didn't think she was a 'hero' for them to look up to; there were plenty better people than her to do so. Those thoughts would go unsaid, even if her dissatisfaction with what had happened was obvious to Star. "Understood" She said simply, then looked back to Amelia, attempting to lighten the tone. "But now that I know noogying Amelia is on the table, I look forward to encountering more of that just so there is the excuse for that to happen." She gave a smirk to Amelia, but then took another cursory glance around them. A paranoid look, to ensure that not only were there no shadows or potential cult members following, but also that there weren't any signs of this beast. Considering the beast nested to the south it was unlikely, but Ellesandra wasn't going to completely disregard the potential.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The road ahead of them was going to be a bit of a longer one, so time to chat was on the table. The sun was warm. It was late autumn, so it was surprisingly mild for the time of year. Felt more like a cool summer day, in fact. The ocean was to their east, and its breeze blew upon them tenderly. This was a quiet nook of the world. There didn't seem to be much on the road, though some wild grazing creatures could be seen in the distance. A small herd. Some birds flew overhead. No shadows, nor any other signs of danger appeared. It was a day's travel, according to Father Copia. So there was a great deal of walking to be done. "Remind me why I didn't just stay back in Myst again?" asked Amelia, attitude filling her voice. As the chatting continued, Star's eyes were wandering around. A mild sense of nostalgia was in her heart for being home again, though this place specifically wasn't her home. It was new to her, and the landscape was certainly a lush sight. A fine place for someone to set up a farm with miles of land left unclaimed. Or, well, probably claimed by the kingdom of Serdio, but a warm thought nevertheless. Star also had a mild impatience in wanting to just tackle Ellesandra and make out with them for their companions to see, but, she tempered herself, waiting for a good moment. "Noogie my perfect pretty curls at your own peril, Ellesandra. Plus, my ears are sensitive. I wouldn't expect you to understand that, though." The comment evoked a spark of thought from Star. "Oh, that's right. Amelia, can I take your hand?" asked Star. Amelia looked at Star, raising a brow. "Huh? W-Why?" asked Amelia back, looking suspicious. Star smiled. "I thing I figured out how the shapechanging my auramancy can do works, but I wanna see if I can emulate you to be sure," she said. Amelia, naturally, finding this an interesting point to study Star's auramancy, had to contend with the idea a moment, before ultimately offering her hand as they walked. Star kept her smile and walked up beside Amelia, keeping her stride. "Watch to make sure I don't have any big rocks in my way, Ella?" asked Star. Amara perked a brow. "...Oh, we're getting to nicknames now, are we?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smiled as Amelia continued, knowing she wouldn't have staye din Myst unless she had been forced. And then she glanced over to Star, feeling that impatience, and raising an eyebrow at her. It was in her court, to do something. Then Star...was she doing that, or testing something else? Ellesandra watched curiously while Star walked up, then smiled at the nickname. "Yes Mar, you and Whippersnapper aren't immune to them either." Ellesandra wasn't entirely serious. She would call them a nickname if they wanted to be called one, but it was a way to generally mask Star's use of her name as a nickname. This wasn't done because she felt like she needed to hide their connection, but to open it up entirely to create a more shock factor when Star did whatever she was going to do to reveal their relationship. "I'll ensure the only big rock near you is Amy's head, Star, don't worry." Continued teasing, though she was keeping an eye on Amelia to ensure that she wasn't pushing too far. They had built up a joking and teasing relationship like this, but she wanted to ensure she didn't cross a line, didn't ever make Amelia feel like she disliked her, or to hit a sore point for her at all. It was easy for these kinds of friendships to unintentionally go too far, and Ella was being mindful of this. Otherwise, though, she kept her eyes on Star and her surroundings, both curious as to what Star was going to do as well as ensuring that she didn't, in fact, trip over a rock.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia just gave a mockingly tired glare at Ella. "At least I won't split my noggin open for taking a small fall, grandma," she fired back. There was irritation, but it was entirely benign. All bark, no bite. And the tiniest curl of a smirk at the end. A little signal that no, they weren't going too far. Amelia had settled into this relationship with Ella, and was fine with it. Neither were really poking at subjects the other found sore, yet. Amara just smiled and shook her head. As they moved, there were no dangerous rocks to speak of, though the ground was a tiny bit uneven at points, so tripping wasn't entirely out of the question, and some minor nudging might be needed as Star closed her eyes and kept walking with Amelia, taking their hand. She concentrated for a moment, then...Pop! Ears that were just like Amelia's and Amara's appeared on top of her head, and her human ears vanished. She held this for a few moments, then released Amelia, and her form 'reset' swiftly after. She blinked a few times. "I uh. I don't know if that worked," said Star, moving her hands up to on top of her head, releasing Amelia's hand. "Did it work?" she asked, earning a chuckle from Amara. "Sure did. You were a fine fox-kin for a moment," she said, earning a small smile from Star, who then went about focusing again, except this time not holding onto Amelia, and...Pop! Back came the ears, which flicked atop her head, showing they were more than just decoration. "Huh. Feels pretty similar to the ears the others had back in Neet..." she mused, moving her hands up to smooth over her furry ears. Amelia huffed. "So, what, you just gonna go around collecting hybrid people's traits and turn yourself into a shapeshifter now? What even ARE your powers?" a question that evoked a nervous giggle from Star. "A-Aha, well, there's a lot of foundational things I do know, but the reason I wasn't so quick to offer anything in Myst is, well, my mother knows the ins and outs of it more than I do. There's still a lot I don't really understand. This shapeshifting thing is new to me, but...I've definitely interacted with other people in the past, so I'm starting to wonder if I could recall those traits, too."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra noted the acceptance from Amelia, and that they were still in the clear with this. When they came to tricky terrain, she stepped up and put her hand lightly on Star's elbow to help guide her through it and support her if she did trip any at all. The assistance was done quietly, letting her focus on the shapeshifting. When the ears first appeared Ellesandra smiled, staring at them and then looking at Amelia's to compare them. The desire to rub her head and scratch behind those ears was still there for Star - but not for Amelia. When they went away, and then Star focused on bringing them out again, she had to actively refrain herself from reaching out for it. When Star continued to explain her powers and shapeshifting, Ellesandra added in. "And like with Keiko, I don't think you even know you're shapeshifting sometimes. It happened then, and then yesterday when you randomly grew wings and didn't notice it." She wasn't going to explain what they were doing when she grew wings, but... "And that time, you weren't touching anyone that had wings. When you were healing Keiko and just there, you touched the person first to gain some sort of attribute of them. But there weren't any angels or bird people otherwise nearby when you had white feathered wings. I'd assume that has to be from someone you've touched or met in the past?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the desire. She adjusted her pace while walking so she was right in front of Ellesandra. If they were gonna reach out and rub at her ears, she wasn't going to stop them. There was an acceptance in her, and in that way the two had a way to 'talk' through their auras, their emotions. If either wanted something, and the other felt that want, there could be a reaction to it. Of course, general acceptance, or nervousness, or even anger at certain feelings was not at all as clear a way to communicate at times over words, but for something like this? It was clear Star was a little excited by whatever vague thing Ellesandra wanted related to her ears. "The wings are...Something different I think. I've connected auras with people with wings before, but I'm guessing they weren't ashen black wings, were they? I think I would have noticed that. They were...Something else. I recall my mom talking about them before, but all she ever said was that she couldn't have them anymore. I never was told why, or what they mean. Only that it has something to do with auramancy, at its core, rather than shapeshifting. I...Never thought I would encounter them, if I'm being honest." A subject of great mystery that naturally had Amelia and Amara curious, exchanging glances, hoping for more information on the subject. Though one has to wonder how to skirt around the circumstances of when they appeared...
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra held herself back from reaching out to touch those ears, even when offered. It would be a bit more of a familiar touch than she'd shown with Star in the past and she wasn't about to give up the game to rub her new ears when she could summon those ears later to do so anyways. Instead, she shook her head at Star. "No, they were white. Didn't last long either, but oh well. Your auramancy is a mystery." And then, to change the subject to avoid the context of the wings appearing, she looked over to Amara and Amelia. "By the way, I lied earlier when talking about Willow during the attack. I wasn't sure how much the story might spread, if Father Copia would share it or if others who understood common were listening in, and these are things I'd rather our enemy not learn at all. I was able to sense Willow at the beginning. I suspect she was the one cause the magic through the crystal, like channeling it or something. When I struck the crystal I aimed myself to coincidentally land onwhere she would have been. She moved and that's when the crystal broke. So she may be more of a magic user, despite having a wicked looking Lance and shield." Ellesandra paused for a second to remember what she saw, and shook her head. "I also did see her. She was....not humanoid looking. Closer to something that might be considered an abomination or demon, and not in a sexy demon kind of way. She immediately shouted not to look at her after her invisibility was broken, and ran off. Between that and what Sapphire warned of her, my suggestion would be to not make it known you see her if we do encounter her again. Sapphire implied she might lose control in attacking us if so." And then, after another brief second - "Also Sylvia can cast some form of black lightning. And moves faster than me with my haste spell. I'm pretty sure I shocked her-" she paused, then smirked at her unintentional pun "when I sent her lightning back at her, and I cut the back of her legs after the Father distracted her, but she's dangerous."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star considered what Ella had to say about this all. It would be something she might need to focus on, see if she could evoke somehow. But without really knowing what it was, she found that prospect difficult. Just like how she didn't know she could shapeshift. That was a thing that one doesn't often learn on the average weekend afternoon. But, now she knew, and maybe it would come in handy for more than just putting on some cute kitty ears and tail with a sexy outfit and crawling up along the bed towar-- Star shook her head. Ellesandra probably felt that rising, bubbling heat of arousal. That, with the shake of her head, was pretty conclusive evidence that Star was having dirty thoughts. Just earned some weird looks from the other two. "Didn't you say you killed that Sylvia bitch?" asked Amelia, trying to get the story straight in her mind. "So that makes one down, right? Then it's just a matter of killing the other two somehow. Hopefully they aren't as able to take on all four of us by your estimations without breaking a sweat and we can put them in the dirt. I'm also gonna guess they won't leave me alone long enough for me to summon Vaerix to crush them, so...It might be prudent to talk about battle tactics a little sometime, but the quick and dirty version generally goes that Amara stands up front and taunts the hell out of people who try and fail to kill her even after she bleeds all over them but doesn't stop, I bring out one of my various summons and use battlefield control magic to make our enemies easy targets, and this is where I'd usually say someone like Maeva moves up and finishes them off, but the rest of the crew isn't here, sooo...That leaves you as secondary frontline, and Star as healer. Do I have that about right?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked at Star when she felt that spike of arousal, and then saw the shake of her head. A little bit of mischieviousness crept up in her, but she resisted doing anything to make matters worse for Star. They'd be walking for a while after all, no real opportunity to take out those desires. So instead she refocused on Amelia. "Sapphire killed her, yes. However there was indication that Valentina would just resurrect her, so my guess is us killing them really won't mean anything in the end. Sapphire also implied that even with my penetrative magic, I wouldn't be able to stab through the gem that sustains them, so I don't know if killing them is even on the table. It would be more fight to survive and get away, unfortunately." Ellesandra wasn't pleased with this idea, even if it was potentially not going to be a factor. Valentina had agreed to call them off, Ellesandra just didn't know for how long that would happen. "As for tactics, yes on me being a secondary front line fighter. I'm more designed to strike and take someone down quickly, or to dismantle enemy magic users since their magic will have reduced to minimal effect on me. Star might be a good supporter, in a supportive and healing magics?" Ellesandra looked to Star, to confirm this was accurate. "And in addition, she empowers my abilities naturally with her auramancy, so they will make me more effective as well."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Of course she can," was all Amelia had to say, then sighed. "Captain I promise I will never complain about the crazy traps and enemies we have to face on our other ventures. This tops them all. Easy. Like even that Lich we bargained with so he didn't kill us. This is worse. So much worse that I'm really confident in going back to him and killing him when this is all over, because for us to come out of this alive we're either gonna become gods or die trying, I swear," she said, evoking a chuckle from Amara. "I'll remember that when you start complaining five minutes into the next adventure we go on, once we DO succeed, DO come out alive, and DO get back to Myst to take a few months off and celebrate," said Amara, casting a smile over the others around her. Her confidence was unshakeable, or if it wasn't, she was really good at making others believe she had that unwavering confidence. Star smiled back. "My supportive powers are dependent on my connection to someone's aura. And while I can build that with you two over time, there's a quality I mentioned before that I share with Ella called resonance which makes us particularly adept at that bond, so my powers are strongest on her. It'll often make the most sense for me to focus on her, though I'm happy to meditate with either of you to focus on empowering our auric bond, if you think it would help. I'm also good at mundane healing with medical supplies, and arcane healing of the more typical sort. Your natural auras as a paladin are something I could empower as well, Amara." Amara considered the idea briefly, seeming to consider its tactical implications. "Something to keep in mind, though if you're able to turn Ellesandra into our trump card while we support, I'm fine with that. So long as the bad guys are dead, we're not, and destruction to any civilian infrastructure is avoided, I don't much care how we get there."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Hmm. Ellesandra had thought Star could do more supportive stuff for the others, but it made sense that was limited by her aura. She had looked at Amelia with interest when she'd revealed they'd gone up against a lich in the past, and at Amara with curiosity in regards to how well she'd done in that situation considering paladins were particularly well matched against undead. Then again, a Lich wasn't just some basic undead - certainly something she could see them having to need to bargain for life with. Mentioning Ellesandra as being the trump card caused a little bit of discomfort, though. She reached up, gauntleted fingers scratching at the back of her neck for a moment at the thought. She would rather be supportive front line, not the trump card. She wasn't a general, or commander, or captain. She wasn't the one to build a strategy around, she just helped it. At least, in her mind that's how it worked. The idea a strategy might be built around her being a trump card with Star's support put more pressure on her than she was comfortable with. Did she voice any of this, though? Absolutely not. Instead, she nodded. "We'll see next time we get into a combat situation. Amelia, last time you had the big dragon you took time to summon and we needed to guard you for it. Are there others that would take a lot of time like that, and is that the typical way we might need to go about fighting around protection, or was that a special scenario considering the strength of the creature you were summoning?" If every time Amelia summoned something it would take her out of combat for a few minutes while she focused, that would be important to know. Her and Amara would have to work well together at keeping an enemies attention and splitting it up some between both of them, and away from Amelia.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"No, Vaerix is definitely my strongest summon, and for that reason takes so long. I'm better at it now than when I first joined his spirit to my summoning pool. It used to take three times as long, which was...Pretty much useless in an active conflict and thus reserved for siege tactics. Which he excels at, I might add. There are a few others that take a bit of time, thirty seconds to a minute or so, but most of my summons are instant. The reason I chose Vaerix for that one fight was because of the strength of the magic radiating from that creature. Anything less would have been a waste, and too much wasted mana would have meant I wouldn't have been able to summon Vaerix. So, if I'm going to summon him, it's because I feel we seriously risk losing if I don't, and that the field of combat allows for that extended vulnerability. Having you both to frontline gave good odds against a single opponent. If it had even been just two instead? Probably would have tried to get us an escape instead." explained Amelia, ditching her attitude for what was indeed a serious answer. The subject of combat and tactics clearly didn't warrant any playful jabs in her mind. She wasn't a member of a renowned team within the Followers of Myst for nothing, after all. "No offense to anyone present of course. Not that you both aren't excellent at stabbing and all, but I hold no delusions about us being the biggest fish in the ocean in these lands, even if bitch-tits called off her goon squad."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded along to what Amelia was saying, considering how bad they'd struggled with a single of these knights. If there were two, she would agree with Amelia about focusing on an escape plan over doing any specific summons or attacks. But when Amelia commented about Valentina being 'bitch tits' and her 'goon squad', Ellesandra spluttered out a laugh. "Bitch tits. I'm tempted to visit her door during my sleep tonight just to tell her you said that, but it might be begging for her to renege on her promise to leave well out of it." Still, that temptation was there, and the idea of calling her bitch tits left a small smile on Ellesandra's face nonetheless. "Regarding your summons though, keep in mind that I'll have to actively focus on not drawing their mana into myself if I come into contact with them. So using them to haul me anywhere or move me somehow might not be super helpful, just in case we get into a niche scenario where that is necessary. And if I need healing, Amara, best to let Star do it - her whole auramancy thing helps bypass some of my natural resistance to such magics." She didn't know why, but she wasn't going to be looking a gift horse in the mouth. "If you do have to, just assume you're healing a wound twice as worse as what I actually have and heal it as if it's like that. Typically just enough to keep me going again, don't waste all your energy on it."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had moved to walk beside Ella at this point, having given up on getting ear scratches. The ears poofed away in a puff of blue mana as she kept her smile about her, taking in the landscape. There was some minor nostalgia in her heart, though it couldn't be terribly strong as this wasn't a land she'd ever been to before within her home. Still. It was Gurhal. It was home. She folded her hands behind her back mostly to resist the temptation to hold Ella's hand while they went along. She then giggled slightly at Ella's reaction. "Somehow I doubt your desire to get a dig at her will faze her much, but I support it," said Star. Amelia just work a grin at Ella's response, clearly pleased to get the stoic knight cracking a laugh. Amara nodded to the information. "Duly noted," was all she had to say on the matter. Pretty straight forward.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She looked over to Star falling alongside her and reached out, lightly brushing her hand across Star's shoulder. A stray touch, something that wouldn't look out of the norm - though as this continued, the temptation to say fuck it to their plan and just reach for Star was growing. She looked around them at the landscape, doing another check for shadows, but expecting nothing and just keeping an eye out. Unless Amelia or Amara brought anything else up, Ellesandra would let the conversation dip into a comfortable silence while they walked, instead focusing on the thoughts swirling through her mind. The fight the night before, things she might have done to do better and prevent it. Was there something she could have done to stop it from happening all together? Other than stopping their adventure of course, because that was out of the question. And what all did they know about their enemies? The Cult of Faust and then whoever just served Valentina, other than her main 'goon squad'. The Cult of Faust at least would be mostly hidden, but she wasn't sure about the other, or how they might find or identify them. Something to consider while they travelled.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The conversation did have good cause to dip into comfortable silence. And so it lasted. There was a long road ahead, and there was much for everyone to think about. Star certainly had things she wanted to talk about, things to talk out specifically with Ellesandra, but they were not appropriate to have among company. There was also the matter of it maybe being best to leave until they were in a safe place, for while unlikely as it seemed here, the notion of being emotionally turbulent when a need to fight arose would be problematic. So Star just was stuck in her own mind, her quiet and ever-present love for Ellesandra radiating from her and seen as fluttering waves of pink along her mostly azure-blue aura for Ella to see as well as feel. So it was, the sun crested slow over the sky, inch by lazy inch, pushing down its warmth onto the group to keep them tenderly warm on this beautiful day. Really, there couldn't be a better day for such a walk. The sort of ambient weather one prayed for for long distances. Weather one might decide they want to just walk around in just because. It was nice. There was occasional comments that rose up along the way. Checks for if anyone needed a rest. Times to stop and eat. To refill water canteens, which Star would be able to do easily, and would be necessary given there was no fresh water source near them. The plains looked like they got rain often enough to sustain long grass for the occasional creatures they saw grazing. It would make for good farmland. But it was also just a bit too uneven to be used as is, and would take some flattening that clearly nobody yet had cared to do to colonize this place. Or maybe there was just not enough people in the region to care. Whatever the case, things were calm. It was an easy walk along the road to the Seventh Fort. It was three hours past sunset by the time the Seventh Fort was visible by its torches upon the guard towers. Four circular guard towers stood on the corners of the stone fort. Arrow slits were visible on the upper chamber of the circular towers, though just barely against the darkness of night, and only because of interior light. Humanoid blobs of darkness could be seen on the ramparts connecting the guard towers, likely marksmen with longbows or crossbows. Thick stone walls enclosed the fort entirely. A metal portcullis gate connected to the road. Lowered, as was its default state. Two guardsmen in chain shirts, helms, with shields and spears, stood idle by the portcullis. Seeing figures approaching however, the two guardsman stood ready and, while they didn't actively assume a fighting stance, the presence of people on the road at this time of night did provoke a guarded stance. Something was called out from the guard to the upper walls, and thus did the four figures on the ramparts turn to stand at idle attention, watching the encroaching adventurers. Not with hostile intent, but with preparedness to respond if the four approaching were enemies. A sight that evoked some nervousness in Star, but she was not deterred as she knew obviously that none of them were here to cause harm. And with Amara and Amelia still perhaps not even able to speak the local language, that did leave it up to either Star or Ellesandra to address the soldiers.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Being able to see Star's aura was still new to Ellesandra, and she did her best to ignore it. It was nice to feel that love from her, and Ellesandra did let it swell a little in her own chest, but tried not to focus on it. Despite knowing Star was entirely open about her emotions, and had given her permission, it still felt...wrong to just look into someone's aura like that. It was interesting to see how it probably looked for Star for everyone, but beyond that she didn't spend much time trying to ascertain any of the specific meanings behind the colors. The day passed well, companionable silence or chatter happening along with a couple of breaks for rest and food and water. As the night had set, she had just been considering suggesting a stop - not wanting to have to try to find that nearby town and endanger them, but instead perhaps heading back out upon sunrise - when they saw the fort in the distance. With it being this close, she held back, and simply continued forward towards it. Upon noticing the guards moving around atop the walls, and the nervousness from Star, she reached out to lay her hand on Star's shoulder gently. Then she winced, realizing she was responding to emotions not stated and feeling a little bad for that, but either way it had been done, and she squeezed Star's shoulder to provide comfort. Knowing that talking would likely fall to her, at least at first considering this being a military fort, Ellesandra looked up and sought out the eyes of the one who looked to be in charge. She fell upon the one who had originally called out, if there were no obvious insignia's or equipment differences that indicated who might be in charge, and she made sure to stop well away from the walls or gates both to make it easier to look up and see the guards, as well as to reduce any potential sign of hostility. She raised a hand in greeting, ensuring that she wasn't in a defensive posture or with her hand hovering near her weapon too much at all. "Greetings. We're seeking Sir Captain Albert Lamington, if he is available? Father Copia, from the nearby town of Neet, suggested we might meet with him to discuss some plans we have for travel throughout this land. We've a letter of introduction, should it be needed." As always, Ellesandra was straight to the point. Lay out the pertinent information, but no need to go into detail with the guards - they didn't need it and probably didn't want it, and rambling about the specific details would just make them look suspicious. Drop the appropriate names of introduction in there to show they weren't just random bandits, and hope for the best.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled in response to the swell of love. More of their silent communication. Just a silent way of saying the words to each other, reminding each other they are there. Them reacting to her aura and reassuring her wasn't something Star found uncomfortable. She could tell Ellesandra did, which had her just smiling and holding in a little giggle. She knew it was important to them. She knew they didn't mean to. But it was also something that, at least partly, she hoped helped them realize how hard it could be for her, and how there truly was never any malice to it. Something she still did her best to keep in check, of course. But it wasn't malice that led her to that initial incident with revealing what Amelia felt. Sometimes it just happened without thinking, just like that. The comfort was accepted, all the same. And indeed, she never would have any problems with Ellesandra reading her emotions and responding to them. It certainly had positive uses, even if it might also cause issues. Once they were at the fort, Star was relieved, as Ella would feel, that they took the lead. Truly, she was not the choice to speak to soldiers. There was nobody really clearly in command at the gate. Just guardsmen, each donning the symbol of their nation and their colours upon the cloth worn over their chain shirts. The colours of the kingdom of Laho were gold on dark green. The symbol was, fairly simply, the emblem of a sun. Easily identified. The guards received the explanation well. "[Gurhalian] The old man's still kicking is he?" asked the one guard with a more relaxed tone. Knowing they were not about to be assailed by bandits, they relaxed visibly. The guard shouted up to the walls. "Oi! Captain's got guests, see if he's still awake, yeah?" called the guard, then resumed standing in place. Clearly, them being let in was not really in the cards. A bit of time passed, but eventually, a far more obviously in-charge man arrived at the portcullis, though didn't bother having it raised. The man had a cleanly shaven face, long brown hair, green eyes, and quite the chiseled features. A real handsome fellow, for those who cared about that, which certainly did not count Ella. No real emotion except maybe a little tiny bit of intimidation was felt from Star, but she was obviously fine and just unused to being among soldiers. Albert looked at the group. "[Gurhalian] Captain Albert Lamington, at your service," he said with rote introduction. "What might I do for you folk this evening? Forgive the security, as well. Can't let you in here, and can't leave the gate open at night." Knowing that the letter was likely going to be needed, Star retrieved it subtly from her magical pocket, doing so behind her back to avoid the flash of magic before the eyes of the others, and held it for Ella to take when they saw fit.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to the man who commented on the Father still being alive. As one of the guards headed off to get the captain, she turned to murmur a basic translation to Amelia and Amara. There had been some surprise that Amelia had not prepared her own spells for this type of thing, but perhaps she had was just letting them take the lead anyways? Either way, it didn't matter. As the Captain approached the portcullis, with it not raising, Ellesandra simply lowered her head in a respectful acknowledgement of him. "No forgiveness necessary, Captain. We're currently seeking to travel quite a distance into the Star plane here, and unfortunately our teleportation option was...sabotaged to place us at essentially the furthest place from our destination, and despite trying again we were unable to correct it. We arrived just outside of Neet, and upon speaking with Father Copia he recommended we may come and potentially request assistance from you, should you have any airships that could use some extra security or passenger money heading out anytime soon." She turned to glance at Star, just as Star handed the letter over to her. She held up the letter, though did not step forward to hand it to him yet, not wanting to approach without permission to do so. "He penned a letter of introduction, and may explain more of the troubles we're facing than I feel comfortable discussing in the open, in case you're interested." She would offer the letter forward, but would not start heading towards the Portcullis to hand it through the bars until she was given the green light to do so. And once she had been given permission, she passed it through the bars and then took a few respectful steps back to the rest of the group, ensuring they kept plenty of distance so there was no caution or concern regarding her proximity.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

One guard stepped forward to grab the letter to then hand over to Albert through the gate. He pulled a dagger from his belt and swiped it under the wax seal with a practiced motion and sheathed the dagger again, then pulled the letter out. "[Gurhalian] Damn darkness - Oi, bring that torch over here a moment," ordered Albert to a nearby guard on his side of the portcullis. The other man scrambled forward a little and removed a torch that was secured in a sconce on the wall to hold up near Albert to give the man the needed light to read the letter. Its contents would remain ever a mystery to the group, perhaps, for once it was read, Albert folded it back up and handed it to the guard next to him. "Put this in my chambers," he ordered, then looked back to the group, moving hand up to stroke across his neck. "Blasted old priest.." he muttered, then sighed. "Aye, if it's to pay back that old fool for keeping me alive to this day, I can secure you something. We've got a scheduled airship trip from Lidiera to Fletz in three days. The King's Candle - the airship - is scheduled to arrive in the morning, then just needs time to get the crew resupplied and get any maintenance done. There's an inn in Lidiera, just following the road northeast to the coast about an hour if you're slow afoot. I can send a messenger in the morning to inform that the King's Candle will have four extra passengers, if you'd kindly provide your names. Just understand that this is a one way trip, yeah?" Fletz wasn't their goal, but if Ellesandra did study the map that Amelia had secured well while they could, she may recall that Fletz was listed as the capital of Tiberoa, which was was midland in the Moon plane, sharing the southern border with Veldime. Snowhaven, their ultimate goal, was in northwestern Veldime. Hence, this wouldn't get them all the way, but it would get them within a distance that walking was an option. A slow one, but still an option.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched Albert read it, feeling a little hesitant about what might have been written there. And that it was moved to his chambers felt sudden - but she didn't pay too much mind to it. Instead she listened to the options, and then glanced to the group to see if they were alright with this. Mostly she looked at Star, but did glance towards Amara and Amelia - who she realized probably hadn't understood what was said, after doing so. Instead, she just focused on Star. Ellesandra had not, in fact, studied the map closely enough to recognize it's location. All she knew was that it was not the specific place they were going to, but obviously there wouldn't be any flights to Snowhaven considering it had been destroyed. "Star?" She asked, actively bringing Star into the conversation at this point to step in. As this was her home plane, and her mission to getting to Snowhaven and finding her mother, the decision truly fell to her in Ellesandra's eyes. Ellesandra would support all the way, and if this got them closer then she was all for it, but otherwise she was going to be deferring to Star to make the final decision on a thing like this.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star saw things as either taking this offer or having to walk there. It was free. It was right there. It was going to cross the majority of the distance for them. So Star smiled and nodded, then bowed her head to Albert respectfully. "[Gurhalian] We very much would appreciate that, Captain Lamington," she said, electing to use his most professional title. Albert nodded softly at the agreement. He wasn't doing this for these four of course, so them accepting or not wasn't really something he cared much about. But, business concluded, he then saw fit to collect the names of everyone, which Star was able to provide. Albert then called for his messenger who he would be tasking, and he had the messenger take a good look at the four women present, as he would be standing by in Lidiera to validate they were the people joining as passengers on the King's Candle. "[Gurhalian] Right. If that's all, I'll ask you to move along to your business," said Albert, giving Ellesandra a chance to raise any other business or do as asked and have the group move, presumably along the road to Lidiera.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched as everything was concluded, looking awkward at the messenger just staring at them to take them in. When they were dismissed, she lowered her head to the Captain again. "Have a lovely night Captain." And then she turned her gaze to the guards and the messenger as well. "And all of you." She said this with a polite smile, the one of someone who knew that guard duty on the walls might not be the most thrilling thing, and this might be the most interesting thing to happen that evening. Hopefully, it would be, for their sake. With the pleasantries had, she turned and jerked her head back to indicate to Amelia and Amara they head off. Ellesandra waited until they were out of earshot of the guards and all before she recapped the basic conversation that had been had, so Amelia and Amara would not be left in the dark. "I don't believe that is the specific location we're going to, but I'd be very surprised if any airships still went to Snowhaven anyways after what had happened. How far is this going to be getting us?" She said, looking between Amelia and Star as they walked along the road. She didn't plan on taking them to the Inn, simply because of what had been discussed this morning, but if they just set up camp near the fortress that'd raise suspicions. Best to get a little bit away before finding a place to make camp.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"I remember hearing stories about Fletz. IT's in Tiberoa, which is the south neighbor to Veldime. I recall King Zior had learned from an oracle that he was to have twin daughters, and in that premonition declared he would build twin towers within the castle, one for each of them, that were connected to one another for the princesses to have all to themselves. If we're going to Fletz, I assume we'll see not just those towers but also the nobility there. As for how far? Well...I know some people from my home had been to Fletz, so it's obviously close enough that we could walk it if we need to, at least. Or get a coach without going broke," said Star. She looked around at their surroundings to figure out where there might be a suitable place to camp - the roads were mostly clear, but there were patches of forest. Camping in the open was a possibility, but the shelter provided by trees was more advantageous. They'd be able to camp outside the city without trouble, more than likely. "I had a copy of the map made while in Myst, one that has been translated to common, if you'd ever want to take a look at it, grandma," said Amelia, who did still have the map case with her, though it was now a duplicate within, as the original was safe in Myst.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella nodded, listening to Star's explanation. There was an obvious sense of discomfort at the mention of princesses and potentially seeing or interacting with nobility. It would be obvious to Star why this was not exactly something Ellesandra wanted to do, even if she fully knew how to and would be able to do so when the time came. A glance was given over to Amelia as she added the information about the map, giving her a smirk. "Oh, thank you Young Whippersnapper for taking care of your ol' Granny." Ella changed the pitch and tone of her voice so that it was a crackling, older lady, even as she began to lead them off the road and towards the trees that Star had noticed. She didn't want to sleep out in the open considering they were completely new to the area, and didn't know what types of patrols happened or what the danger might be. Best to take guard shifts while in the woods, by a campfire. "I'll take a look after we've set up camp. We should discuss guard shifts, since we're planning on camping out in the wild for the majority of our trip. I'm comfortable doing any shift, if necessary." Ella had trained herself to wake up at small sounds, and to be able to wake up and go back to sleep easily. Granted, that was before she had deities in her dreams controlling them, but hopefully if she were interacting with one of them they would be able to notice something might be wrong and send her back, like Sapphire had.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amara wore a smirk as Ella and Amelia had at it. Amelia then scoffed. "Guard rotations? Pleeeeaaasse that is SO low-magic, you're showing your age there, granny," said Amelia with a proud toss of her curly blue hair. "You've obviously never heard of Leomund of Greyhawk, and his excellent contributions to the arcane. While it can't stand up to Mordenkainen's magics, we'll sleep soundly thanks to yours truly and her ability to cast Leomund's Tiny Hut. While not as stealthy as burying ourselves in the dirt, it will ensure no other creatures or spells can threaten us for eight hours. Exactly eight hours. So be prepared to wake up after seven and a half hours, just in case. Amara and I are used to this, so even if you two lazy bones are konk'd out in the morning, we'll be up and ready to wake you if there's some wild animal waiting outside the dome."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra squinted at that. "Tiny hut? How tiny are we talking here?" A glance was given to all four of them and in her mind imagining how closely they might have to sleep. Cuddling up with Star was one thing - she enjoyed that and had gotten used to being next to her. Cuddling up with Amelia and Amara too, though? That was...a bit more physical contact than she was really wanting. She wouldn't refuse this, if it were the better protection and the safest way to rest, but there was an obvious discomfort at the imagery that came to her mind. "Are we talking big enough to have a tent within, or are we all just going to be laying near eachother and having to listen to Amy's snores all night?" She deflected her discomfort with humor, and a jab at Amelia, while looking around the trees until she found a place that seemed like it would work. She began leading them to it, her hand unconsciously going to rest on the small of Star's back as they walked to ensure that she wouldn't trip now that they were in a more forested area and the potential for roots or sticks to be on the ground and in the way were there.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

While Star wasn't unfamiliar with traversing a forest, she wasn't going to deny Ella's hand on her back. A little flutter of love shot back at Ella for that touch, just as a reminder of how their touch affected Star. "Please, I sleep like an angel," fired Amelia back. "And 'tiny' is relative. It's exactly twenty feet from edge to edge, ten feet high. Plenty of room for a couple tents, though we'll be fine in just bedrolls if it matters. The climate inside the dome is always comfortable and dry, even if it was a crazy thunderstorm outside it. You can all come and go from it as you please, but I will have to stay inside it or the spell breaks. It'll be safe to set up a campfire if you want, but you won't need the warmth. The exterior will be opaque and blend in with the trees, so nobody will be able to see us inside the dome, though we'll be able to see out clearly at all times. Archamgi of old really do think about all these things. Honestly, I wonder how you ever managed to travel around in the past without me. Uncomfortable and wet, probably," said Amelia as they arrived at where Ella had been leading them. Star had amusement fluttering from her as Ella and Amelia went back and forth at each other, happy to just let them be friendly with each other in their own way without interrupting, with a little occasional reminder of her love flowing through to her lover through her aura. Nothing overwhelming. Just a little sweet flutter, and mostly not done intentionally but rather just a by-product of her love being so open and free towards Ella, just as her serene nature had always been before love lived in her heart. It was easy to just let it live in the background, but if Ella did focus on that at all, there was plenty of love to feel floating in Star's aura.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was pleasantly surprised by the idea of it being twenty feed wide. It wasn't large by any means, but it was certainly large enough to prop up a couple of tents. "I don't know. Star's tent is a bit big." She remembered, smiling over to Star at how extravagant her tent was. As they got to the place and Amelia finished nerding out on the explanation of the spell, Ella just nodded to her. "Uncomfortable around you, always. Wet? Not because of you." She winked, and then moved to place her bag down by a tree and stretch, while keeping her eyes out on the surroundings to get a feel for where they would be staying. "Well in that case, no watches needed I guess. Thank you young whippersnapper for allowing your granny to get her well needed bone healing rest." She turned to look between all of them, unsure how to go about doing this since it necessitated Amelia to cast the spell, and she didn't want to start setting up a tent if that's not where Amelia wanted to set up camp. Also the idea that Amelia wouldn't be able to leave it implied she needed to go take care of her personal business and stuff prior to setting it up, and perhaps they should eat if it was set to specifically last only eight hours? "Any preferences for our dinner or shall we subsist on rations? I'm sure we can find some critter in the woods nearby, but considering the early arrival of the airship perhaps we should get settled sooner rather than later." It was already far beyond nightfall, after all.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia very dramatically rolled her eyes. "Half tempted to throw an orb of water at you just for that one, eugh," she fired back, evoking a chuckle from Amara, who seemed to enjoy the more adult jokes even if she didn't participate. Indeed, Amelia did have some personal business to tend to before they set up camp proper, so off she went. "Rations I think are best for tonight. Like you said, we have to be up early," said Amara. "Though if you want to forgo a little sleep and hunt, I won't stop you." Whatever the decision, Amelia was back before long and set about performing the ritual for the spell, which took her about a minute before the dome of force was sprung up all around their location for them to make camp in. Amelia and Amara seemed fine with just bedrolls, but nobody was going to stop Star and Ella from pitching a tent together so the two could have a little privacy. Though depending on how committed Ella was to surprising their comrades, that might be a little revealing. On the flipside? Star would be utterly devastated to not have nighttime cuddles with her lover, surely; her aura was tingling with excitement - not specifically arousal, though there was some of that - at the notion of laying with Ella. It had been a long day on the road. A long day of not being able to let her love out.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra rolled her eyes in kind to Amelia suggesting she'd throw a water orb at her. Part of her wanted Amelia to try, so she could throw it right back at her, but she didn't actually encourage that. Instead she set about walking the perimeter of the camp to get an idea of it and looking around to ensure they weren't on any normal hunting paths or anything that would bring someone stumbling across their camp unintentionally. She'd shaken her head at Amara's offer for her to go hunt, and then stayed near Amelia while she were casting her spell so that she'd be included underneath the dome. As the other two just pulled out a few bedrolls, she glanced over to Star with consideration, before motioning with her head to a bare space not too far from the other two. "Why don't you get our bedroll out and set it up?" Even if she herself didn't want to cuddle up next to Star tonight - and she did, surprisingly to herself - she could feel that excitement coming from Star. Having not been able to show their affection all day for the hope of surprising Amelia had not actually been as fun as Ella had hoped, and at this point any enjoyment they might get out of shocking their companions wasn't worth the extended lack of touching or looks. And certainly not worth saying no to the excitement she felt from Star, so she fully planned to cuddle within Star's bedroll with her. In the meantime, she began removing her armor, setting it up near the edge of the dome, though she kept her rapier on her hip for now. It'd be placed near the bedroll when time came for actual sleep.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star looked at Ella when the instruction came and she nodded with a smile. She produced the bedroll from the magical space as asked, then got it set up on the spot Ella had indicated. The luxurious item drew some gazes from Amelia and Amara, who naturally compared their plain, if serviceable, bedrolls to the more luxurious one. Ellesandra hadn't slept it in it yet, but would find once they did lay down in it that it was comfier than some of the beds they had shared. Not quite as much give or room in it, but it was far, far more comfy than the standard bedroll. Star kept her newly bought magical outfit on, as she imagined if there was a need to fight right from waking that changing wouldn't be an option, and it made more sense to keep that tactical benefit available. Time came to get some rations in them before bed, though it seemed Star was waiting for Ella to take the lead. Curiously, Amara and Amelia didn't ask any questions about there just being one bedroll, nor Ella referring to it as 'our' bedroll to Star. Did they somehow already know?
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She too eyed the bag, having only slept next to Star last time and not in the bedroll with her in it. It looked like it would be comfortable, but she didn't go about testing it out right now. The lack of comment from Amelia and Amara was noted, and she felt a small bit of disappointment she couldn't make Amelia react to it oddly. In hindsight though, Amelia HAD called their night with cocoa a date already, so the two probably already thought they were a couple and that this wasn't exactly odd. And they had shared a bed the previous night, considering it had been a one bed room and they'd known that when learning about the potential rooms at their last inn. Ellesandra would move about getting some basic rations prepared for Star and her. Any of the dried fruits and stuff she would hand over to Star, though she was careful to also provide Star with the dried jerkies as well so she got protein. A bit more mindful of Star's nutritional balance than her own, unfortunately. She ate quietly, looking around and then stepping out of the dome to look at it from the outside. Then tentatively stepping inside again, she glanced to Amelia. "This certainly would have come in handy many times over the past few years. Lovely spell, Amy." An actual compliment, and not one barbed with teasing or insult. She'd begun to make her way over to the bedroll and inspect it, then look up at Star. She was staying in her clothes from under her armor so as to not dirty more simply sleeping and sweating; she'd change in the morning. "You ready?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Even if Ella was intent on neglecting their nutritional balance, Star wasn't going to have that, and would give gentle little nudges or place specific things she wanted Ella to be eating in their hands. Caring about what someone ate was one of many ways to show love, after all, though Star hardly needed to be in love with someone to want them to eat right. She just felt she had more leverage to get Ella to actually do it, with their connection being as strong as it was. The compliment to Amelia was met with a response that didn't miss a beat: "Yeah, I'm awesome, I know." Words that preceded her slipping into her own bedroll. Star gave a soft nod at Ella's question, a little more excitement tingling in her as she moved to the bedroll to get in first, then held it open for Ella to join her. Once more, the other two didn't seem to really care. Amara kept her spear laid on the ground by her bed, within arm's reach but not actively in a spot that might be accidentally knocked around to hurt someone. Amara's bedroll was also much larger than the other ones present, with her being so tall. It definitely could hold another person in it, though as Amelia was sleeping on her own, it didn't seem this was a case of two couples traveling together. Once Ella joined in, Star was happy as could be to cuddle up with Ella, relief washing over her as she was finally able to embrace them and squeeze them close. A little uncertainty then followed as a burst of desire filled her. Desire to kiss her lover. A desire that only had her looking at her lover. Were they...Still pretending..?
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

When Star slid into the bedroll, Ella watched and then slid in after her. It was only then that she removed the rapier and it's sheath, setting it beside the bedroll so it didn't get tangled up within, but was still within reach right beside her if needed - similar to Amara's spear. As soon as Star sidled up to cuddle against her though, she let out a soft sigh and closed her eyes, leaning her head to the side to rest it against Star's. It was because of the feeling of her desire, of her uncertainty about the desire, that Ella opened her eyes from the comfort of being held again and looked to her companion. She met Star's eyes, and then her own dipped to Star's lips, and she leaned in to brush their lips together. No need to pretend anymore, pushing the pretending for a full day was long enough. If an opportunity hadn't come up yet, it certainly wouldn't be worth it. That being said, she did keep the kiss chaste. A gentle brushing of lips, no tongue. And as soon as she pulled away, stopping and leaning back in to press their lips together for just a moment longer before finally resting her head back against the bedroll again. Another soft, relieved sigh came out, just...enjoying Star next to her. Oh there was arousal stirring, but considering their location it was well controlled and pushed down - but she could still very much enjoy having Star cuddled up against her. An arm slid around to lightly hold Star back in return, letting her fingers run up and down Star's arm, and then squeeze. She didn't say anything, only because there was no way to say something without the others overhearing, but she was there for Star and she tried to let her aura say that for her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled into the kiss. Another blossom of love. A beautiful reciprocation of their affections that made her heart sing. She delighted in it while it lasted, but understood why it could only be that chaste little motion. As much as she was an open and loving person, there was a comfort line that stopped well and short of openly having sex in front of other people, not even considering the matter of whether the others would be okay with that, which she just assumed they were not, and thus there were a thousand reasons to stop her from entertaining that arousal she felt in return. Still, she couldn't just ignore her emotions, so Ella would be entreated to Star's arousal NOT being pushed down as she snuggled up with her lover, snaking one leg between theirs to tangle them up. She considered pushing her leg up just to tease them, but didn't. It'd be easy to get carried away if she gave in. So, with contentment at this cuddle, she gave a few tiny, nearly silent, peppered kisses on Ella's jaw before resting against their chest. "I love you, Ella," she said softly. Just for Ella to hear, though the sensitive ears of the other two could probably hear her anyway. This little showing and how the other two completely ignored them was about all the proof one might need to conclude that yes...They already knew, or at least suspected it so strongly that this wasn't a surprise, and would have probably just met any attempt to surprise them with it with a flat 'we know' sort of comment.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smiled into the soft kisses, and tried her best to ignore the arousal she could feel from Star. Her tangling their legs up made the temptation rise up in Ellesandra just as well, but she pushed it down again. It wasn't easy, feeling Star just letting herself feel the arousal. This was one moment where she silently wished Star knew how to push feelings down, because her feeling it made it harder for Ellesandra not to feel it too. She dealt with it though, without complaint. When Star told her she loved her though, Ellesandra felt her heart skip. There was a surge of love in return, a bit of relief at hearing it again - as if there had been part of her afraid that she wouldn't - and also hesitation to say it back where others might here. Not because she was shy of them, but saying it back where others could hear too...was a little more permanent. She couldn't pretend to Amelia or Amara later that she wasn't just as fully in love with Star, if Star decided to leave her. She wouldn't be able to easily hide the broken heartedness behind some tough player bravado as if she'd just been sleeping with Star. She chewed her lip for a moment, but there really wasn't a choice in it. If she just went without responding, saying it back, she would feel horrible - because she did love Star. And it wasn't like she was ashamed of it. Just...scared of what would happen if Star decided to stop loving her, in the future. "I love you too." The response came just as softly, even if there was a good chance that the more sensitive ears of their companions could hear them. "Now get some sleep before Amelia makes good on her promise to throw water at me for keeping her up." This bit was said just a bit louder, loud enough that if the two animal kin didn't actually have increased hearing, they'd be able to hear Ellesandra whisper it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Just be quiet about it if you two bang, all right?" said Amelia back without missing a beat. Zero surprise or much care about it. It was just a normal thing to her, to have lovers in her company, it seemed. Perhaps there were some love connections among the First Crusaders? Hard to tell from her words alone. Though Star was initially very pleasantly happy at hearing the words back, she IMMEDIATELY went bright red at Amelia's choice of response. Her heart picked up and pounded in her chest, and she clung tight to bury her face against Ellesandra's chest. Calming down to sleep was going to be a little harder now but...She'd get there. Eventually.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra immediately pursed her lips to hold back her laughter, which got even harder to do when she saw how red Star went from it. There was a swelling of affection for Star at that, seeing her adorable face burn bright red, and Ella reached down to lightly run fingers over those cheeks even while she silently laughed. She considered commenting about how they'd failed to do that the night before and she'd have to teach Star that, but she held back. She was unsure just how comfortable Star was with comments like that, and she didn't want to make Star self-conscious about it - especially since it had been her first time. So instead she just said - "Aye aye, whippersnapper" and then lightly tugged Star against her, snuggling closer. Her eyes closed and she pressed her lips softly to Star's forehead, still with amusement at how red she was, but didn't proceed to try to 'bang' her like Amelia mentioned. If they could manage to wait, Ella would. She didn't expect Star to be any quieter their second time, and that that would truly be something they'd have to work on with her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly wouldn't magically get any quieter overnight. It in fact would probably make the whole experience less enjoyable for her to have to consciously focus on not making noise, doubly so since she had already had a taste of how much Ella liked her reactions. So, a sexless night came, and Ella was, when they eventually drift off to bed, pulled by the lucidity of their dreams to the dark realm where they could make the choice. To speak to someone, to enter the card, or to walk off into darkness and have a pleasant dream, or perhaps one that was a little saucier given how the two were feeling just before bed.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had been expecting this this time, and as soon as the choice was made she pulled the card out. A glance was given to Valentina and Sapphire's doors, to ensure there was nothing different about them, but Valentina had agreed to stay out of things for now and Ellesandra didn't want to risk anything with that agreement. She also wasn't sure visiting Sapphire might create some sort of imbalance in all that with what Sapphire was saying, so avoided that door too. The card, however, was an entirely third party to all this, and she knew for a fact that going into the card's dream wouldn't cause any issues with the pact between Sapphire and Valentina. Well, as close to for a fact as she could, considering magic was involved and she'd been surprised at every turn so far. So after confirming there was nothing different about either door to indicate one was wanting to speak to her specifically, she instead focused on the card to see what exactly it had in store for her that evening.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Indeed, there had been nothing different about the doors. The card had been shimmering just the same, only as a signal that it was there and could be interacted with. The shift in balance had moved since last Ella had looked upon it. It was now slightly more on the triumph side than the defeat side. And when Ella entered, the reflection of this in the castle interior was noticeable. The cleanliness and pristine condition of the interior Ella might remember being sequestered to the small sliver of space the triumphant paragon had been occupying was now spread across a bit more than half of the interior, including the piste that was still there, right in the middle. The golden barrier was something Ella could pass through at will, though the paragons would not be able to do the same. The defeated Ella was huddled up against the far wall, knees brought up to their chest in a position that was well familiar to Ellasandra. That self-comfort posture. The triumphant Ella meanwhile was cleaning and oiling her rapier. The supplies for it were set up neatly on a table near her. A process that Ella was no doubt familiar with, though it seemed these paragons of Ella had also gotten their upgraded rapiers along the way. Hardly surprising given the flexible nature of the dream, but it did reinforce that they were just mirrors of the real Ella. Star was also present in this space, though it remained not a conscious and lucid Star. It was just her presence, made manifest. Sia was, as before, present, though Sia was leaning against one of the walls, silent, and would not speak unless spoken to, and even then would be deflective and reveal nothing about themselves, even if their emotions and concerns for Ella were true to the woman as they would be as if Ella had met them in the present day. This was not about Sia, though Sia remained important to Ella, and thus remained in this realm. "Welcome back, Ellasandra," said the triumphant version of Ella. "Nice of you to join us."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked around when she came into this familiar scene. It was interesting, seeing how the victorious side had taken up more. She still didn't see herself as this victorious version of herself, eyeing her for a moment, and then looking over at Sia. Sia was quiet, but there was a stirring of that same shame from before. The guilt, even though it had all been partially processed with Star, was still there. She shifted uncomfortably and turned her eyes away from Sia, unable to look at her for long without those feelings coming back up. She smiled to the Star in this dream, and then looked over at the defeated version of herself. She was silent regarding the version of her huddled up against the wall, a frown taking over her face. "Is it?" She asked in response to the greeting, but didn't expect an answer. Instead she walked over, through the golden barrier to the defeated side, and stood in front of the defeated version of herself. She considered what to do for a moment, but then held a hand out - as if to help her up, if she wanted to get up. "Trust me, coming from myself, you look better standing than huddled up like that." A joke, even if not a great one, to try to cheer...herself? up. There was just something in her that hated seeing herself like this, even if she knew she herself had been like this just recently. She hated it, because she knew it would make Star sad to see her like this. And so, she wanted to be better - and wanted her internal, or illusionary self to be the same.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The two versions of self watched Ellesandra as they moved to help the defeated self up. Unfortunately, the defeated self was just that - an embodiment of everything that defeated Ellesandra. The defeated self looked up at the offered hand. She didn't take it. Instead, she moved to stand, herself. Getting a closer look at her, she was wet. Her skin was bright red to the point of blistering in a few spots. A manifestation of her self-abusing with hot water; if it wasn't obvious from the visual showcase, it was something that the dreamstate helped Ellesandra implicitly understand. Every cruel thing Ellesandra did to themselves was shown on this figure. Something that further showcased itself as she reached her left hand up to jam her thumb into her right shoulder. Right into the wound. The pain shot through her, though she looked numb to it aside from a little jolt. She then looked at the true Ellesandra. "What's it matter what I look like?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra pursed her lips while looking at the obvious self harm done to the defeated self. There wasn't blame, or pity, or anything like that. There was understanding, watching herself press her thumb into her wound. Unlike Star who protested it so strongly, she understood why it was done. Truly sympathized for what felt like a need for it. It was a maladaptive coping skill - one she would be dead without having turned to. The physical pain was a comfort, in many ways, to her tormented emotional state. So, she let her hand drop and nodded. "It matters because we're trying this whole making ourselves vulnerable thing with her" - Ellesandra pointed back to this dreams version of Star. "And you doing that hurts her. Don't let that add to your consciousness, too. It's instinctual, but you have to fight that.." as if she were telling herself the same, having been using the shower for that exact thing this morning. She turned to glance around after, certain this conversation with her defeated self wouldn't go far. She knew herself, so instead she went ahead and changed the topic for her. "So what's the test this time, myself? Or are we all meant to make merry and be friends?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"There's no making friends between us," said the defeated self looking at the triumphant self, who had moved to observe from the edge of as far as she could walk, one hand on her hip. There wasn't anger or judgement in her eyes. Just sorrow melded into the proud outward persona. The dream Star stuck close to the real Ella, though it was true that even in this space, Star was still Star, and though Ella might not stop the defeated self from harming themselves, Star jolted towards them initially, though too late to stop them. But once they had done this, Star reached out and gingerly, ever so gingerly put a palm against the defeated Ella's cheek. Healing energy washed into them. Which, inadvertently, made real healing energy wash from Star in the real world to the real Ella, and Ella would feel it flow over them. Except real Ella didn't have actual wounds. So it would instead tingle inside their right shoulder. Not changing anything, this time. But with nowhere else to go, it had to focus on that spot. If nothing else, it was soothing, and Ellesandra would certainly wake up more rested for it. "The test is always happening, Ellesandra. Every moment of every day, waking or slumbering. The barrier is always moving, at such imperceptibly small degrees that you cannot see it moving. But every good deed empowers me, and every time you give up or succumb to weakness, it empowers them." There had been animosity between the two paragons in the last visit. Something that had seemed to have smoothed over a little. "You wouldn't be able to survive the actual trials of the Spire," said the defeated self. "And I don't mean that in offense. You would have to...Completely be rid of me before you even stood a chance," said the defeated self. "But if you really wanted to break Valentina's curse, that remains a path you might be able to one day walk to achieve that goal. If ever you think yourself up to the task. But before you could ever hope to do that, well...You would need to be able to look at yourself and see the same beauty that Star sees. You have...Far too much to overcome as it stands now, knowing that even just looking at Sia makes guilt rise in you. But," she continued, keeping her tone firm, yet calm. Not angry, not accusing. Just explaining. "If you desire a test, then you may summon Freya to administer one. Recognize, however...That your tests will not be easy. They will be designed to break you, as any good test ought to. And if you lose, then you will lose progress you have made. Should you succeed? Then you will be that much closer to success. To triumph. To having power that you will be able to use as you see fit to bring Star back to her mother."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The fact she'd felt the healing was...interesting. She eyed Star for a moment, again curious if this was not the real Star, before turning her attention back to the two reflections of her. She frowned at the information, shaking her head. "I don't think it would be healthy to be rid of either of you. Even if I do eventually see myself as Star does" which was a very, very doubtful if "that won't change who I've been before. How I've known defeat, and relied on what I could to stay alive." At this, she motioned to the red skin and such on her defeated self. "And if I need this power, how many tests must I complete? Can I call upon it and face the test in the moment, when I have no other options? I would love clear, honorable rules for this to be laid out." At this, she looked over at her victorious self. She was still ignoring Sia in the room. "If it's something I need to work towards, night over night, so I can't take the trial that allows me to save Star when I need to if I just do it in the moment, then I want to start now."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Being rid of your pains and weakness does not mean they never happened, nor that you are perfect. You cannot change the you of the past, but your defeated paragon is not you of your past. They are you as you are now, and all the desires within you that hold you back, and bring you to succumb to defeat in the future. Every defeat is a chance to learn, of course. But there are those who will not resist defeat with their all. Who will accept defeat when it comes." At these words, adamantine spikes rose up with sharp metal grinding noises at various places within the castle floor. In no places that would hit anyone, far from it. But as a reminder of what Ellesandra felt when they were about to fall on those spikes. Acceptance of defeat. The spikes pulled back after a few moments. "To be clear this isn't about individual battles or skirmishes. Not having the requisite skill to defeat an enemy is not itself a sign of weakness. Only a path to growth. That is something I know you know well. What you face now is one in the same. So if you wish to know the rules, then..." She trailed off, and Freya herself appeared within the castle space, standing on the piste. She had the same neutral expression from when Ellesandra first met her. The same fluffy ears that looked very, very similar to the ones Amara and Amelia had. "That the rules are firm and honourable is guaranteed," began Freya in her calm, gentle voice. "You cannot change yourself for the better, wholly and completely, in an instant. At least...I don't know anyone who has ever been able to do so, sincerely. So you have two options...You may let this work out passively; your actions and what guides you to make those decisions will change the balance of this card. But if you'd care to accelerate it, well...You can choose to face trial that will seek to induce the necessary circumstance. And you will either triumph, or be defeated. The answer of 'how many' cannot be given, for it depends entirely on you, yourself, Ellesandra. You won't be able to simply reserve this card as a power to call upon when your need is greatest. The power is only yours, if you have already proven you are ready to wield the power you need in the moment. If you wish to reserve it as a contingency, then...I recommend you do start now. But do ask questions if you have them. For these trials will be proportional to how close you are to triumph. They will not be kind, and that they may break you, perhaps even kill you, remains a clear danger. Understand this power is not granted lightly. None will force you to pursue it...But the opportunity to pursue it was granted to you, knowing you may very well need it."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head at the first statement from her victorious self. The person behind her, the defeated her, wasn't her. She refused to believe that, that she would throw her sword down mid bout. That she would give up, entirely. And then the adamantine spikes came. They drove the point home entirely - Ellesandra HAD given up. She hadn't even fought against the spikes, tried to angle herself to not die, tried to fight against whatever magic was holding her. Was it an illusion, or psychic attack? Could her intentionally trying to draw magic into her or push off whatever it was work? Could she have somehow come out of that without the feeling of death that had sent Star into a fit of grief? She doubted it, but the truth was she didn't even try - and the point was well driven home by her victorious self. She had been defeated, then. Accepting her death. In a way, even looking forward to it. She glanced back at the defeated version of herself. Shame and guilt at her just...accepting, and looking forward to the death crept up in her. Mostly in memory of how distraught Star had been when she came back out of the portal. How she'd been so willing to just accept, embrace her death when she was leaving behind so much pain by doing so. She clenched her teeth, simply listening to herself as things continued. And when Freya appeared, Ellesandra turned to look at her in a bit of surprise. She hadn't been expecting her, having thought this was entirely just a self-discovery thing led by the card. Was Freya watching the whole time with that? Her answer disturbed her, though. She had been hoping to not have to face these 'trials' unless absolutely necessary, considering what Amelia had said about them. About the information learned in Myst, and how dangerous these things could be. Also, how very few ever actually completed them successfully. Surprisingly, the idea of these trials breaking her didn't actually scare her. While it was obviously a real danger, part of her knew that Star would be able to help her. Would be there next to her, and would help her put the pieces back together as long as Ellesandra didn't run from her, break so far that she gave up on them. The comfort of knowing that caused a bit of love to swell in her chest, but there was also the risk of death. That risk, considering how Star had reacted to her perceived death before, was ever more greater. It was enough to almost make her say no outright, but she'd also be foolish to do that. She sighed, taking in a long deep breath and just letting it out while looking down at the ground in thought, considering her options. She remembered Valentina. The suffering that was described, and what she had very briefly felt when she'd touched the curse herself. Not only that, but what she'd seen and felt in Valentina's memories, how the curse had afflicted her and how she'd slit her own throat trying to escape it, futile. Opening her eyes, she looked at Freya again, determination in her question. "Will this power somehow allow me to be able to break a curse of power level and complexity to rival something the gods themselves would create?" A very direct question - a very direct purpose for the power.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Freya received the question with a moment of pensive pause. When her thoughts had concluded, she returned a question to Ellesandra: "You speak of Valentina, do you?" she asked, though ultimately the truth of that was not required to answer, and she did so swiftly: "What you face are not the true trials of the Spire. These are but a fraction of the true power of the Spire; make no mistake, that fraction still carries with it immense strength. But a curse of the magnitude of which you speak requires greater power than what this single card may provide you. However, it would be a monumental step closer to it. Consider it one of very few pieces you would need to succeed in overcoming something of that magnitude. Something that makes the impossible, while not effortless....Possible. Does that answer your question?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She watched Freya as she seemed to consider this seriously. A nod was all that was given in regards to Valentina, and when Freya confirmed it wouldn't exactly be an easy 'hah broken now' thing, but it would make it possible rather than impossible - even if difficult - Ellesandra nodded. She took in a deep breath to steel herself, unsure what to expect next, but spoke up after steadying herself. "Then yes. I would like to be tested now." There was determination in what she said. It wasn't because she just wanted to help Valentina - though she agreed with Valentina that this curse wasn't the type of thing she'd wish on her worst enemy. It was because it was the only way she could see to stop Valentina. It would not only make her killable, if that was necessary, but it would also hopefully pull her back from her path. She could help a lot of people, not just Aurora, by breaking that curse. And she was steeling herself for the potential risk that she would undertake with whatever this test would be, knowing damn well that these tests wouldn't be pleasant. She wouldn't be so lucky to have the test be just a fight with someone strong. If this was to get rid of her 'defeated' version, this was going to be an emotional gauntlet, and she was already steeling herself against it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was a transactional air about Freya as she nodded to Ellesandra's words. The motions of someone doing something by rote. Done so many times as to make them happen without a single thought required. Freya dismounted the piste and walked to the northern wall. At her presence, a large set of double doors appeared with a shimmering golden twinkle, inset into the wall as if they had always been there. The doors slowly opened with a groan, revealing a torch-lit hallway beyond. "Do not enter this hall unless you are fully ready, Ellesandra. It will be here tomorrow, and the next night, and the night after...You set your own pace, and you may always retreat back to this room, provided nothing within the trials prevents you from doing so." Freya gave a stoic, but firm look. "Do you understand the rules? Do you have any final questions?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra stared at the door, considering the rules. Knowing she could retreat back to this room was good. She looked at Freya and considered. "How does time work here? I'm sure much of the night has already passed, or some of it anyways. Should I be forcibly woken during one of these trials, will that effect it at all? Or will the trials force me to sleep in longer than I normally would?" The only thing stopping her from just walking towards the door right now was the logistics. She wanted to proceed, but she also didn't want to make them late for the airship, either. If this was something she needed to plan and address each night with her companions so they weren't concerned if she didn't wake up, it would be best to push that off for now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Freya gently shook her head. "Time is immaterial here. You can spend days in this space in the span of a single night, if the trials demands it. Similarly, you can have the entire night pass in three seconds, if the trials demand it. Your worries of your conscious self are not needed. To all others, to even your body, your sleep will be just as long as it tends to be on average, and you will wake when the time is right."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to Freya. She glanced around at the defeated and victorious versions of herself, then at Star. She smiled softly, walked over to her, and leaned in to press a kiss to her forehead. It wasn't the real Star, but if she'd felt the healing before, would Star feel the love and affection being sent by this? Just in case something went horribly wrong. She would fight against it, but she also wasn't going to go into something dangerous without at least doing that. She glanced only briefly at Sia, who had been silent this whole time. Like before, she didn't watch her old mentor for long, instead looking to the door and taking a breath. She mentally crossed fingers hoping that Sia wouldn't be the topic of whatever this first test was, and then moved towards the door. "Thank you then, Freya. I'm unsure why you're here offering this to me, but I won't look a gift horse in the mouth." Gift might not be the right word, considering the danger with potentially getting this power. Yet, this opportunity itself was a gift, considering how few people were probably given the opportunity to begin with. She reached the doors and stood on the threshold, looking around to Freya just in case she had anything else to say before Ellesandra went in. If she weren't stopped, Ellesandra would begin inside, her left hand resting gently atop the hilt of her rapier. It might be too much to hope that the test was a fight rather than emotional storms, but if it was a fight Ellesandra wasn't going to get caught off guard.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Freya said nothing to the thanks. If anything, it looked to make her a little sad. But her face was always in such a state that she looked like she might just always be sad that it was hard to really tell. The triumphant self was present, and gave a nod to the true Ella as they went off. The defeated self was back to their place against the wall, sunk down with knees brought up to their chest, not even there to watch Ella walk down the hall. And Star? Well. Star received the kiss, and her figure fluttered with love, then she leaned in to give Ella a proper kiss on the lips. A loving, tender kiss. Slow, but with no tongue. Her love had only ever been growing stronger every moment they spent together. While the truth would remain out of Ellesandra's ability to know for certain, Star had shown signs that she could feel what Ellesandra felt in their dreams, and her presence within these dreams was good reason to believe that the feelings reached the real Star. Star did let go, reluctantly, to allow Ellesandra to go off down the hall. The doors remained open, but darkness eventually overtook the entrance. The hall was quiet. The crackle, the pop of torches, was the only sound besides Ellesandra's footsteps. The walk was decently long. Long enough for Ellesandra to sink into their own thoughts for a while. No threats could be identified, and it was a singular corridor, so looking forward, and occasionally back, was all that was needed to ascertain that there were in fact no monsters to stab. The stonework of the hallway was simple, but done well. The floor had a thin red carpet lining the center, with about a foot on either side of exposed stone flooring. No threats arose during this walk. The hall eventually showcased a larger room coming up. Once entered, Ellesandra would see this to be a larger corridor, this one lined with mirrors. Golden-framed mirrors on the left. Wrought-iron framed mirrors on the right. The hall was divided down the middle by a solid stone wall. There was a wooden frame leading to each pathway, left or right. On the left, to the golden mirrors, inscribed in the wood, it read: 'To remember what you are fighting for'. On the right, to the wrought-iron framed mirrors, the inscription in the frame read: 'To finally let the pain stop.' Ellesandra now had a choice to make, with the balance of triumph versus giving up persisting in this trial. A choice that one might think obvious, but...When the options were plainly visible, and there was nobody there to influence Ella's decision, it truly became about what they desired most in the world.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had felt the hesitation from Star. She'd returned the second kiss as it was given, and the hesitation from Star had caused a bit of hesitation in herself. But she had continued forward, nonetheless. As she began down the hallway and the darkness shrouded the door behind her, she stopped and looked back. And then around, preparing herself for the potential of something coming out of the darkness. Nothing happened, so she continued forward. The walk was long, and a little peaceful if it weren't for her being actively on guard as she looked around. She wanted to ensure whatever might be waiting for her didn't catch her unprepared. During the walk, she was reliving the kiss from Star, letting that fuel her to keep going with confidence. To know that Star was there to support her, through all of it. As she got to the larger room, her eyes turned to look at the mirrors to the left, and then the ones to the right. The gold and iron motif was here as well, and she took a moment reading the inscriptions on each. The idea of letting the pain stop, of not feeling this guilt and shame and grief was tempting. With no one around, would it be too bad to just let herself not hurt for a while? But her eyes turned to look at the inscription on the golden mirrors. To remember what she was fighting for. There wasn't really a choice here. As long as Ellesandra had something to fight for, had something to live for, she couldn't just let the pain stop. Previously, she'd convinced herself that letting herself live with the pain was her punishment, her penance for what she'd let happen. Now, she had not just a reason to live, but a reason to actively fight it. Turning, she headed towards those mirrors, not feeling like she needed to remember via the mirrors, but certainly choosing them over the lack of pain. Ellesandra would take any amount of pain if it would protect Star and prevent the past from repeating itself.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ellesandra's choice would prove, at least for the moment, a pleasant one. The mirrors were each glimpses into Ellesanda's heart. Genuinely happy memories, whether they were with Sia, or Marigold, or Aeras, or Star...Flashbacks to the past that let Ellesandra reflect on the things in her life that were worth remembering. And even if Ellesandra was not actively fighting for or living in the kingdom in which they were born, those memories, provided they were genuinely encouraging, were not off limits. They were good times. And of course, recent memory with Star was not off the table, either. All moments that Ellesandra could look back upon and truly smile. Memories that reminded them about good times. Memories that reminded them about what their heart desired. Which, depending on how Ellesandra truly felt about her past, may or may not result in a lot of the mirrors showcasing recent memory with Star, from as early as when they met and Ellesandra saved Star from the pirates, to as recent as just...Looking at Star walking on the road with those furry ears and wanting to scratch them. Ellesandra would be able to sink into the mirror as they looked at each one, able to relive the memory just as it happened. And Ellesandra was free to spend as much time in this space as they wanted. But the ultimate goal, the way forward, was a mirror that was placed on the far wall. Larger than the others, still framed in gold. And inscribed on its frame were the words 'A future worth fighting for'. This mirror was not actively showing a memory, however. Instead, it called to Ellesandra, when they were done with the other mirrors, and compelled them to lay their hand upon the mirror and step into it to see this future of which it spoke.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched the mirrors with a feeling of bitter happiness. The bitter being that, that happiness wasn't within easy reach anymore - at least not in the same way. The first memory was one where she was about eight years old, looking up to a young Marigold on a balcony. They were playing and giggling, Ellesandra shouting about being a knight who fought off the dragon to save the captured princess, and Marigold playing both the role of the princess - herself - and the dragon to fight off Ellesandra when necessary. Two young girls just playing and having fun. Ellesandra's heart light - with some darkness, in that she knew she wasn't truly part of this family, but still the lightness and naivety of a kid. She didn't touch the mirror or go into the memory itself, just watched it, and then the next one. Aeras and Ellesandra in the training ring, Aeras wielding his shield and hammer and Ellesandra a longsword and shield. Ellesandra was about mid teens in this memory, and Aeras was laughing as he fought off Ellesandra. It was a sparring bout, but it was obviously one of fun, and Aeras spoke about how Ellesandra was too aggressive. With a shield, her focus was protecting herself, or using it to protect others. That it was her role, to protect others - not to seek the glory for herself. Another memory of Ellesandra standing next to Sia as an adult. She was armored, in much the same armor she wore today as Marigold stepped forward. They were in the courtroom, an official ceremony as Ellesandra stepped up, then lowered herself to one knee. When Marigold officially ordained her as a royal guard, her royal guard. The pride and excitement was there for Ellesandra at the time, and there was pride from Sia too - though Ellesandra couldn't see that in her aura like Star might have been able to. Last few memories were Star. Various moments, first being her insistence on helping Morrin and the small recognition within Ellesandra. It had hurt, but it was also a moment of being happy that Star was that type of person. Then her joy at being given the blueberries the next morning, and even more like that. Finally, her joy when Ellesandra had told her she loved her. Not just the kissing, not the sex necessarily, but the joy she'd felt from Star when she said it for the first time. Ellesandra took a deep breath, and expected that to be the last mirror, but then she saw Amelia, rolling her eyes at being called whippersnapper, and then Amara sitting across from her at the tavern that previous morning, trying to encourage her about what they were fighting for. Finally, Ellesandra headed towards the mirror indicating it was the future. And she reached out, hand lightly brushing it as she was called for, letting herself be pulled into this memory - or prediction.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

White light enveloped Ellesandra. A warm, beautiful light. It filled their heart with calm. The light then faded to darkness. A comfortable darkness. The touch of a cool pillow on their head. Warm blankets over them. Warm arms around them. The overflowing, overpowering warmth of love pouring into them. The darkness was not from a lack of light, no. Ellesandra's eyes were just closed. They were waking up. But not in the real world, not in the present day. This was a day, far in the future. A prediction. A possible path. A path worth fighting to achieve. That was the only context that was given to Ellesandra in the back of their mind. But what a happy prediction it would prove to be, for when their eyes opened? Star was right there. Her aura calm and full of love. Looking at the slumbering woman, she looked like she hadn't aged a day. Ellesandra herself, also, had not aged visibly. The pain in Ellesandra's right arm was gone. The muscles felt firm. Conditioned. Ellesandra's rapier was by the bed in its sheath. Within reach, but it looked like it had been resting there for multiple days. There was no need to grab it in Ella's mind, here. Ella and Star were in a bed. A bed that Ella knew was...Their bed. A bed they shared each night. The warm blanket over both of them was a soft, powder blue colour to match the darker blue bedding. Soft, silk textures caressed Ellesandra's skin, and Ella would see that not just she, but Star as well was nude under the blanket. More than that...Star was pregnant. Heavily so. And in her aura, Ella could see the aura of the child in Star's womb. Ella's child. There was implicit knowledge that it was Ella's, just looking at the aura. The aura of the unborn was connected to Star, but it remained unmistakably their own. Star stirred upon feeling motion from Ellesandra, her arms lovingly, possessively curling around Ellesandra to pull their bodies more flush together. "Mmnh...Ella..." she said tenderly, sweetly. "I can feel mom's out with Luna out front. Go check on them? I'll be up in a minute, promise.." Luna? The name shouldn't inspire any familiarity. But it did. Luna was their first daughter. Their second was on the way. And this was their quiet home together, one they shared with Aurora. 'Mom'. Star had said 'mom'. So this path was predicted as a future where Aurora was saved, and was alive. Ella's clothes were plentiful to be found in a wardrobe in the room. Star had her pretty dresses and cute clothes, but more recently had only been able to wear maternity outfits for obvious reasons, which were among their shared stock of clothing. Ella's clothing was well-made but, of course, more to their own tastes. Their armor was set up on a fine armor stand in the room but...There was no need for it. Not now. How could Ella hug their daughter with armor on? No, just some basic clothes would do, if they were going to listen to Star, who certainly did want Ella to do what she asked...But also seemed quite content to just hold onto Ella, moving her left hand to stroke at Ella's cheek briefly while she still have them close. And there, Ella felt the warm, but hard sensation of metal against their face along with Star's hand. A wedding band, and an engagement ring, though the ring was formless and shifting, as if its shape or form was too uncertain to exist in this prediction. If Ellesandra's heart settled on something specific, it would become that, as if it had always been that. Naturally, through the act of morning routine, Ella would certainly notice a golden wedding band on their left hand, on their ring finger, as well. So it was...Did they listen to their wife, and check on their daughter? Or was Luna in good hands with Aurora, and there was just...five more minutes they could spend together in bed?
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

It took some time for Ella to get her grounding on what was going on. She was in a bed, with Star. Naked. The love coming over her felt normal now, somehow, like it was something she got all the time. It took her a few moments to realize that Star was...pregnant. With HER child. How? The realization hit her gut, and she stared at Star against her. A mixture of happiness and disbelief flooded her. And then Star mentioned something about a Luna. Luna, who she just...knew, was their daughter already. The idea of this caused tears to spring up. Tears of longing, for this exact thing. Tears of joy, that this was an actual possibility. That this future, at least, Star didn't leave her like Ellesandra expected she would. There was still disbelief in it, but even as that came she snuggled her head into Star, just to hold her for a moment. Just to feel the happiness, the aura and feel of their child in Star's stomach. The knowledge they already had another daughter, and that she was out front right now. The tears came, not sobbing, but just...releasing the disbelief, the happiness, the desire that lived so strongly in her heart that she never let herself really feel or want. Never let herself acknowledge more than briefly, because it would set herself up for a hope that she never thought would actually happen. And even if this wasn't 'real' right now, and even if it was just an illusion - not an actual representation of their future - this was truly a representation of her desire right now. She kissed Star's forehead and gave a shaky nod. "Okay, love." Another kiss to her forehead, and then Ellesandra slipped out of the bed. She glanced at her sword, and at her armor. She didn't put her armor on, moving to put more basic clothing on, but something in the back of her mind reminded her this was still a test. Still the potential that something bad might happen. Even in this potential future, she was preparing herself for losing this. So she took that rapier, otherwise just propped near the bed, to strap to her waist. Afterwards, she would come back to Star in bed. Another kiss, this one on the lips. Gently, so as to not stir her or force her to wake up too much. Her hand moved to run over her swollen belly, her jaw trembling a little at the feel of it, before she turned and forced herself to head out front, to check on Luna and Aurora. The only difference from what this family probably considered the 'normal' for her being that she wore her rapier. To Ella, all of this felt different. Her hair down, not put up. The feeling of love, the knowledge of having a family. She didn't hurry through whatever turned out to be her house, taking it in, and if/when she saw her daughter, she didn't move to interrupt whatever she was doing but just watched with a soft smile.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Their house was modest. Nothing extravegent, but had all that a family home might need. There were a few bedrooms on the upper floor. Fine wooden floors, with carved wooden railings to hold onto while descending to the main floor. A welcoming kitchen and dining area was adjacent to the stairs, with windows to vent out the fumes of the iron stove. A nice living space with similarly nice furnishings. Comfy, but not opulent. Just what they needed, nothing more. The smell of the home was a familiar one. Woody, but carrying the subtleties of the inhabitants. Star of course returned the kisses when they came, though upon feeling the overwhelmed feelings, she was certain to reach out and squeeze one of Ella's hands, looking up at them with those loving, beautiful blue eyes to give some reassurance before letting them go. Ultimately, Ella would end up on the front porch of their home. Aurora was there. She was seated on a rocking chair, though Aurora herself didn't look a day older than Star. She had some maturity to her features, but her skin was as flawless as ever. She sat in the chair, legs crossed, eyes cast out at the area beyond their home. A field of white flowers sat in space in front of their home, and a little girl was among them. Luna. Ella's daughter. She was five years old, wearing a tiny, adorable white sundress, with a straw sunhat that was juuust a bit too big for her still so it wobbled when she moved her head around. Her hair was tied in those twin braids that Star had when Star was little. Luna was trying to, and not really succeeding at, making a flower crown. Her tongue was poking out of the corner of her lips. Hearing the front door, Luna looked over. She smiled bright and wide. Ella would be able to see Luna's aura, too. Happiness. Innocence. Love, for Ella. "Hi momma!" called Luna, her voice sweet and bright. And just looking at Luna? Her hair was Ella's. Silvery and brilliant in the sun. Her eyes were Star's, bright blue and full of love for everything around her. She had Ella's rounded face, and Star's lips. A beautiful little girl, and it was Ella and Star who brought them into this world. It was a balmy spring day. Aurora looked at Ella, then scoffed. "Come now, El. What have you got your sword on your hip for?" Aurora spoke to Ella as one might expect of a loving step-mother. A little chiding, but sweet. "Luna's trying to make a flower crown like you showed her. She couldn't even wait for breakfast, she was so excited. Leave that blasted stick here and go show her again, won't you? She wants to make one for Star."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra saw Luna, and immediately her heart lurched for someone who was obviously her child. Their child. She clenched her teeth together while watching her, working to hold back the tears again. She could see Luna struggling with the crown, and it just made her smile how concentrated she was on it. And then Luna looked up and called her momma. Ella couldn't take anymore, she cleared her throat to work out the frog that was in it and looked down, raising her hand to partially cover her face to hide the tears that flowed. She hardly heard Aurora, though she did. Her eyes were clenched shut and her jaw tensed to try to fight back her instinctual reaction at being called momma. At feeling this overwhelming love for Luna, and Luna's young, childish devoted love to her mother. After taking a moment, she cleared her throat again and glanced over to Aurora. She hadn't expected her first time meeting Star's mother would be in a dream like this, but she took a moment to take her in again. To see how she looked, compared to what she'd remembered in Star's memory. The idea of leaving the rapier here was probably a normal one, but one that her caution wouldn't allow. She just smiled softly to Aurora. "It's a self soothing thing, Aurora. Don't worry about it." Ella tried to soothe aurora, so it wouldn't be weird to keep it on. It also wasn't a lie, really. She was cautious, and surely Luna would know what Momma's sword was by now? She walked out towards Luna, glancing around the field for a moment as a basic sweep to check for threats, before lowering herself to sit next to Luna with a soft smile on her face. "Aurora said you were making a flower crown for mommy. Come sit in my lap so I can watch?" She didn't offer help, not unless Luna asked for it. A basic assumption that Luna would be able to do it or remember it herself, but offering company and support if Luna felt like she couldn't and needed to ask.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Aurora and Luna both had auramancy powers. Both of them could see Ella's stress, the overwhelmed emotions. It evoked a moment of pause from Aurora, who let the matter of the sword go with a little sigh, then nodded with a smile. Aurora was a beautiful woman; much of Star could be seen in her, though her eyes were more silvery blue than the bright ocean-blue that Star's were. The hair was identical, however. Aurora was, without a doubt, Star's mother. She stayed in place on the porch, just happy to relax and watch over her family. There was trust from Aurora that Ella knew best, and while Aurora clearly didn't see the need for it, that trust outweighed her worries. Luna looked up at her mother, or, well, tried to. But the sunhat fell more on her face, requiring she move one tiny hand up to push the sunhat up so she could get a look at her mother. She smiled, seeing Ella smile at her. There were no threats around. Nothing to be paranoid about. But everyone present seemed quite used to Ella having their head on a swivel. Luna smiled at Ella's words, then gave a big nod. "Mnn! Okay!" she said, then rose up, slowly bat at her sundress to get bits of grass off where she had been kneeling on it, and moved to sit in Ella's lap. She was working at making the crown. She was making slow progress, but making the knots so they didn't unravel was a little taxing for her fledging dexterity. When she sat in Ella's lap, that connection that Ella was familiar with with Star was present there with Luna, too. Connected auras, for each of them to feel each other, even though they could also see one another's auras just fine. "Why were you sad before, momma? Were you sad? You looked like you were crying. I didn't do something wrong, did I?" she asked, her little innocent worry clear in her aura. Of course, her being so young didn't stop her from having those auramancy powers, so there was no hiding emotions around this future family. Though, it seemed, Luna was still confused about how to properly read an aura, and didn't really understand what she was seeing as accurately as Star or Aurora would.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to Aurora, and then when Luna came over to climb into her lap Ella just let out a deep sigh. Feeling the connection there, she slid her hands around Luna's waist and pulled her in close, then leaned back to begin running her fingers through the bit of hair that was coming out of the sunhat. And fixing the sunhat, so it wasn't dropping down in front of Luna's eyes while she concentrated again. Knowing their connection, she knew lying wasn't an option, so she considered how to respond for a moment. After a few seconds of just running fingers through Luna's hair and watching her struggle with the crown, Ella responded with a - "Sometimes, momma is just overwhelmed by how happy she is to have you and mommy and Aurora all here together in her life. It was happy tears darling, not sad tears. But years, there was a little bit of crying. It's not always a bad thing to cry, sometimes it's just...when you're emotionally overwhelmed, even with positive emotions." This felt surreal. Not only having her daughter in her lap, but also to be the one providing instruction on emotions and how they worked. This was Star's domain, not hers. Yet, it just felt right to say that. Sometimes, emotions were overwhelming. She was crying to help with them, a physical expression of that happiness. The happiness that swelled again, feeling Luna there in her lap.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Luna listened. There was implicit trust. Ella could have said she was fishing for turtles in her eyes and Luna would have believed them. Then asked if she needed to also fish the turtles out of her own eyes. But no, the answer was understood. "I understand. Sometimes I get big feelings like that, too. But if you ever have big feelings, momma Star said the best thing to do is hug someone you love, right?" asked Luna, who paused making her crown so she could turn in Ella's lap and move her tiny arms around Ella's neck to give her best, tiny squeeze. "Uuuuuuuuuuuuu-- There!" she said, huffing a little from the exertion of her maximum-power hug. She then turned back and resumed her fidgeting with the crown. While this was going on, Star walked out onto the porch, a little sleepy still. Her pregnant belly was showing greatly through her long, baggy dress. One hand on it, the other resting on the fence at the edge of the porch next to the steps. A warm, loving smile at the scene, though Luna had turned abruptly when she heard the door, to try and hide what she was doing from Star. She then whispered: "You gotta make momma Star not suspicious somehow! It's aspossed to be a surprise but it's not done yet!"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt the strong hug from Luna and she returned it, though not full strength. Feeing her right arm being fully useable was...odd. But she was careful to give Luna enough pressure she felt fully hugged, without hurting the young girl. As she turned back though to begin fidgeting, and then hiding it when Star walked out, Ella just smiled and picked up her sunhat to kiss the top of her head, then put the sunhat back on. "You are absolutely right. Maybe if..." She would move one hand over the partially finished flower crown so that her next action wouldn't cause Luna to accidentally raise it or throw it or anything so that Star could see, and then her other hand moved in to tickle at Luna's side. An excuse for what they were doing here, so that Star wouldn't be curious what they were doing. Just enough tickling to cause giggling and squirming, and then she stopped, smiling widely down at her, making her shoulders a little more broad to help block visibility of what was in Luna's lap. "You got this Luna, just keep working on it. You know I'm here if you need help." And after keeping up that ruse for a moment so Star wouldn't question it, she turned her head to look at Star. To see her swollen belly, and her hand on it. Her smile spread even wider. "Love, you should sit down. Don't be stressing yourself out too much right now." The suggestion was made both out of serious concern for a pregnant Star walking around or standing around too much, and also a way to make it harder for Star to see exactly what they were doing out in the flowers.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Wh-pfffaahahahahahaa! M-Momma! Staaawwwwwwp!" giggled Luna, a fit of giggles overtaking her as the tickles were too much. When the little tickle bout was done, of course, she took one of Ella's hands and brought it up against her face to mush her cheek into it, just as a show of love. Love that her aura flooded with all the same. Love for her mother. Then she set about doing her thing with the flower crown some more. Star received Ella with a hand on their shoulder once they came close. She smiled sweetly. "And miss this precious moment with the most beautiful girls in the world? Surely you couldn't be so cruel to me, Ella," she said in jest, giggling, then leaned forward, sliding her one hand around Ella's neck to bring them into a slow, tender kiss. A kiss that lingered. A kiss that cemented this all. Brought it full circle, and flooded Ella's heart with love. Slowly...The world around Ella went white again. Love lingered in their heart as this prediction of the future fluttered away. It could never have lasted forever, even if it was certain that prying it away from Ella now would hurt. But it was not taken away forever. No. As Ella was being pulled away, the same notion was flooding their consciousness. This. This was the future worth fighting for. This was all possible. It was all as real as it could be, from the current point of the future. If Ella believed in it. If they fought for it. That was what they could fight for. And with that set in their heart, and the final image of the mirror being a still image framing Luna in the flowers, Star and Ella kissing, and Aurora there on the porch with them...The trial was set to begin, for now, next to the mirror, was a violently shaking wooden door. As if battered by strong winds, the door was thudding back and forth, the rattling of the metal of the door's latch in the door frame violently suggested what was waiting for Ellesandra on the other side of it. But it would be up to them, when they had collected themselves, to open the door, and willingly undertake the trial before them.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella enjoyed the touch from Luna, leaning into it. And then looking up at Star when she got there, raising her hand up to touch Star's stomach and ensure she got Star's attention on herself and not what was in Luna's lap. Then Star leaned over and kissed her, and Ella returned it, fully. Not only because she wanted to - because she did - but also because it would keep Star focused on her again. But then the white would spread over her vision...and she would be standing again in front of the mirror, not in the future. Immediately, a sound of protest built in her throat, a groan and whine, and she touched the mirror again. She did not want to not be in that memory. She hadn't had enough. Her eyes closed and she took in a few deep breaths, cementing the memory of Luna on her lap in her mind. Her little fingers struggling with the flower crown, and how you had to twist the stems to get them properly connected and tight. Luna's hand against her cheek, Star's kiss and her swollen stomach. A choked sob came out, only broken as she jumped at the sound of the door near her violently shaking. She stared at her, hand on her rapier and watching the door suspiciously. When it was obvious the door wasn't about to break out, she took the time to breathe and ground herself. Eyes closed, focusing on the memory just enough to hold it in her heart. That desire, that want for that. She had to survive to get to that, if it were a real possibility in the future. After taking her time to focus on herself, she headed towards the door. Her hand was on her rapier, prepared for whatever might be on the underside as she opened the door. She watched to ensure that nothing came through at her, before she stepped in and looked around, preparing herself for what was to come.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It was not the violence of a creature or an enemy that greeted Ellesandra when the door swung open, but rather the violence of nature. A gust of wind pushed from behind Ella to suck them into the next region. The door slammed behind them. Though they could go back and open the door behind them to retreat, struggling of course to do so against the winds that now whipped Ella's skin, retreat remained an option. However, to push forward, Ella was now subject to a torrential downpour upon them, the likes of which they would never have experienced before. The droplets of rain were heavy as they smashed against their body. Though they wore armor, there was plenty of uncovered places on them that were battered by the heavy rain. There was utter darkness all around them. The bright happiness of what was behind them was snuffed out by the darkness of the rain. Yet, there remained only one way forward. Upon slippery, flat cobblestone path was Ellesandra changed with walking forward, in the inky darkness as rain, deafening in its torrent, battered Ella while winds ripped across them. Yet...Even if it was cold, it was just rain. It was just wind. The force was strong, but the trial's message was clear enough to discern: You have seen what is worth fighting for. Now grit your teeth and fight for it.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra was taken off guard, surprisingly, by the strength of the wind. She stumbled, almost falling, but pulled herself back up and hunched into the wind. She felt the rain slam into her almost like a sheet of water, drenching her immediately. Her hair stuck to her head and fell down across her face, and she took a moment to try to pull it back behind her ears. It was useless, considering the wind was strong enough that it would probably pull it out of a ponytail too. Not to mention it was soaked and heavy almost instantly, and she couldn't see anything going on at all. She used what visibility she had to stare down at the ground in front of her feet, to ensure she was stepping solidly as she began to fight against the wind. She'd taken a moment to try to prepare herself against this, but there really wasn't much she could do but quite literally grit her teeth and fight against the wind and rain. And began her slow progress forward, careful to try not to slip and fall, but to continue forward. Her left hand was up, over her face to block some of the rain at least with her head down looking at the ground so she didn't have to look through the rain itself. Small steps, one at a time.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was little to do beyond just grit one's teeth and bare this. It was hard. It was slow. It was torturous. It was exactly the sort of scenario that forced one's body into considerations about whether it was worth it to go on. Retreat was an option. That had been explicit. And there was a certain degree of exposure that was surely fatal. But would that be the case? It wasn't clear. The danger was there, but the goal was ahead. Ella needed to forge on if they wanted it. But they needed to want it badly. They needed to reject the temptation to give in. To fight to keep pushing through this horrible wind and rain. Yet, it wasn't a simple walk. It wasn't just a few minutes of walking and then it was over. Time would start to lose meaning as Ellesandra moved through the rain, step by slow and ragged step. Were they even making progress? Where even were they? The struggle against the rain was an intense one. So it came to be...Would Ellesandra keep pushing? How long would they push? How much determination could they call upon to forge on through this hell? It would need to be a lot, certainly. But if they could manage? The rain eventually stopped. The winds finally broke and settled. And whether Ellesandra was still on their feet or crawling at this point, the trial proved itself to not be over just yet, for what lay before them now was a sheer cliff edge. Darkness was below. Certain death, or so the foreboding energies suggested. A golden spark flicked across the sky as Ellesandra reached this place. It was that mirror. The carrier of the memory. The symbolic embodiment of the future that Ellesandra was fighting for. It soared across the sky, across the blackness of the dark clouds, and onto a tiny speck of land far, far, faaaar in the distance. Miles and miles away. Yet between Ellesandra and this goal? The endless void, the black chasm. It obviously wasn't a matter of just jumping. It was obviously meant to be so far away that it wasn't a test of athletics or magic to soar over the darkness. Yet...There didn't seem to be any other way. An impossible obstacle, or so it seemed. Had it all been for nothing? As Ellesandra might grapple with this, the defeated Ella appeared in a cloud of silvery mist, standing on the sheer cliff's edge. She looked down at the darkness below. "...It'd be easy, you know? To just jump. Let the darkness consume you. It would give me the energy to save Aurora, I'm sure."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra struggled against the wind, the rain. She struggled for what felt like hours, if time even was a thing here. To the point where her legs burned with the effort of fighting against the wind. Eventually, there was one point where she fell to one knee with her head down, catching her breath while the wind and rain buffeted her. This was where she truly considered if she should turn back or not. However, at this point, she'd come so far that turning back would be just as hard. Sure maybe the wind would be at her back instead, but at this strength it would be just as hard not to topple forwards. No, she wouldn't be turning back either. She brought up the memory of Luna in her lap, struggling with the little flower crown but not giving up. Gritting her teeth, she rose back to her feet again and continued forward. Eventually, she felt the wind lighten up, the rain slow down. And then she came to a large, open chasm. Her mouth opened in surprise, glancing around. This was a dead end. She watched the golden light, the memory, sail forth far out of reach. Her heart constricted. Did this mean it truly was out of reach? Impossible to get to? She stared at the darkness ahead of her, looking around again to ensure she wasn't missing any way across. And then the defeated version of herself appeared, suggesting she jump. She stared at herself, then down into the chasm, then back up to herself. "You're crazy." Her heart might ache at the idea that what she'd seen before truly was out of her reach, not possible, but now that she had the potential, the opportunity of it with Star, she wasn't going to throw that away. Instead, Ellesandra found something on the rocky chasm, something loose - a stick, another rock, anything like that - and tossed it into the chasm. Just to test to ensure that it wasn't illusionary, that whatever she tossed would indeed fall. And then, if she could, try to hear for when it hit the ground below, to see if she could tell how deep it was. Testing out her options, to identify if climbing down was an option rather than jumping.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The defeated self just grunted in response. A few loose rocks were available around to be picked up, and upon tossing it? It didn't fall into the chasm. It just landed on...Air? On nothingness? It was floating, level with the ground, on nothing. Before that could get too confusing, the answer revealed itself. With a wave of shimmering golden light, a bridge manifested itself, anchored to the edge of where Ellesandra was standing, to stretch out onwards across the dark abyss below. Another landmass rose up from the darkness as this happened, securing the other side of the bridge. Another vaguely square stone structure was built upon this other landmass of dark stone. The triumphant self appeared upon the bridge, then. One hand on their hip, she nodded to Ellesandra. "Very good. There was a time where you might have taken that offer. To save Aurora. To make it easy, just the cost of your life to pay for it. Have you finally got something to drive you, El? You best. Because you'll need to hold onto that." It wasn't the whole way. But this first moment, it was establishing the precedent. Not giving up, defying the temptation of giving up, had brought Ellesandra one step closer to that memory that sailed off through the sky. There was...So much farther to go. But the bridge to the next landmass was closer. It was progress. And the triumphant self was encouraging Ellesandra to keep marching forward.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra blinked when she saw the rock just land on the air. She hadn't actually expected it to be like that. And now when her triumphant self was appearing, and she saw the golden path, there was...suspicion. She frowned, eyeing the golden path. She grabbed another rock, tossing it on the path again. And if it landed on the path without falling, she lightly reached out, gingerly lowering one foot onto the path without putting weight on it. To confirm the path was real. There was caution and distrust as she glanced past the path down into the depth of the chasm, then up towards the other landmass that appeared. "If this is a trick, I'll stab you through myself." She grumbled at the victorious self, glaring at her. Part of her was annoyed by this version of herself, and pointing out that at one point she would have taken that offer. Hell, just a few days ago she would have. Maybe even the day before. Progress was progress though, and assuming that the golden bridge seemed to be real and solid, she slowly began heading across it, towards the next part of whatever trial this was.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The triumphant self shook their head. "No tricks. Honourable, but tough, is what you can expect," was all they had to say. The bridge affirmed all attempts to confirm it was solid. It supported Ellesandra's weight. There was no evidence to suggest it would give out. And indeed, it did not. It supported Ellesandra as they walked across the path, stepping closer to their goal. The prediction, the future. Their reason to fight. It was far away but...It was there, shining in the distance. The golden fleck of light could still be seen. And when Ellesandra reached the next landmass, there was an obvious door to open to enter the next structure. And when that door opened, light overtook Ellesandra once more, and they woke up. This time, in the real world, snuggled up with Star. It was dawn, and Ellesandra would feel at least physically refreshed. The torrential rains were behind them. They were dry, and comfy. Very comfy. Star's bedroll was something special, there. But alas, Star herself was not pregnant. There was no little Luna running around scheming about making flower crowns for Star. But Star did still love Ellesandra. It was a younger love than the overwhelming, matured love that the Star in the prediction felt. But it was the same love, even if it would need years to evolve to what it was, then. Just like that shimmering golden light in the distance, it would take time. It would take work. It would require slogging through the wind and rain. But it would eventually get there, if Ellesandra fought for it. So was the promise the card and its power made; the card itself had now moved the golden divider just slightly to reveal more of the side of triumph, if checked. One trial succeeded, but it seemed another night would be needed to undertake the next.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There had been some discomfort with the height as she walked across to the other landmass. Despite the confirmation from her triumphant self that there were no tricks, she couldn't help but remember how she'd fallen for minutes before being impaled by adamantine spikes before. The falling, while not exactly causing a phobia of heights, it certainly hadn't made her like them much. And when she opened the door and then...woke up, she felt Star against her, comfortable in their bedroll. It took her a moment to look around and realize that no, this was the real world - not a dream. There was no Luna. A moment of pain and regret, at not having Luna running around, the desire for that. She looked down at Star against her, still feeling that love. Not the same love, but still love nonetheless. She turned, pulling Star against her for a moment, holding her close for the moment. She leaned in, pressing her lips to the top of Star's head softly, trying not to wake her up but still just holding her, either way. She grieved for a moment, for not having the actual reality yet. For not having Luna, or Star with her like this, or that house that they lived in. A grief that it wasn't there yet, but for the first time in a long time...a belief that it was actually possible. That Star might just be honest in that she truly, fully loved her and would continue to do so. Her heart swelled, and she pressed another kiss to the top of Star's head before looking around to see if Amelia and Amara were up, or if the dome were still active. And if not, to do a glance around, just a quick safety scan to see if there were any issues around them right now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The dome of the tiny hut was active still. Amelia and Amara were still asleep. Star, meanwhile, wasn't woken by the first kiss. But the grief, then the second kiss, with the swell of love? That was enough to rouse Star. She blinked a few times, her eyes full of sleepiness, as she looked up from her place where she felt most comfortable, up against Ellesandra's chest. She smiled at them. It was a bit early, earlier than she might have otherwise woken, but there was nothing but happiness and love in her expression and her aura for waking up to seeing Ellesandra. "G'mornin, Ella," she said, sleepily, then leaned in to kiss her lover on the lips. "You...You okay, love..?" She recalled the grief she felt. She held them tenderly, worried of course, but only slightly given that Ellesandra seemed outwardly okay, and was giving her kisses. She liked kisses. Those were good for keeping her happy.
<p>

Ellesandra noted everyone sleeping, but when she felt Star stirring awake she looked at her. There was a tinge of regret at doing something that woke Star up this early. She returned the kissed softly, then smiled at the 'love' nickname. "Yes, I'm alright. Just..." She paused. How to explain what had happened? "Had a dream about the future, and was a little sad that I had to be drawn out of it into wakefulness." There was the longing, for what she'd dreamed for. The obvious desire for it, but she didn't want to elaborate too much. Would sharing the dream with Star change the outcome? She didn't know the rules for this, though considered she probably should share that she'd started taking on the trials. They might not be the same as the official spire trials, since it appeared to only be partial power of that, but still. "We're up early, lets just lay together and cuddle a bit until it's time to actually get up, hmm?" She said softly, sliding her arms tighter around Star and squeezing lightly. Star surely wouldn't need an excuse to cuddle, and Ellesandra wasn't quite ready to get up and disturb their warmth and comfort within the sleeping bag. In fact, if she had her way, she'd prefer to stay there cuddling Star for the rest of her life.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star accepted the explanation. It was certainly something she could understand and sympathize with. So she gave a little nod. "I understand, love...I had a really nice dream that I didn't want to wake from, too. Wanna tell me about yours?" she said softly, more than happy to get nice and snuggly with her lover. Their legs were still intertwined from when they fell asleep, so there wasn't really much closer they could get, but that didn't stop Star from squeezing tenderly just to try. She set about playing with Ella's hair while also giving the odd kiss here and there to their jaw or chin. Just little love pecks. After all that time containing her love, one whole day(!!!!!) she had so much to let out on her lover. So doting affections were on the menu this morning.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella considered what dream Star might have had. How much of Star being in her dream was shared? She remembered that Star had also had a similar dream about being in a field before, a while back when Star was fighting off her nightmares. She shook her head, still unsure how much she should share. "We...had a family." Was all she said. The tenderness in her heart for her daughter and for Star being pregnant again, she closed her eyes and leaned in to hold Star a tighter. Maybe uncomfortably so for just a moment before she pulled back and then settled in to just rest against Star naturally, a hand moving up to lightly play with Star's hair in return. After a moment, she added. "Would you like me to braid your hair this morning? We never got around to that yesterday or the day before, with everything that happened...And we seem to have a little bit of time this morning before we have to get going."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's heart skipped a beat when Ellesandra said those words. A family. Star squeezed back, of course. Her aura overflowed with love, and her breath was lost to her for just a moment. A moment long enough for Ellesandra to ask about braiding hair that more or less fell upon deaf ears, for when the squeeze relented, Star pulled back, tears welling in her eyes, as a single word left her breathless lips: "...Luna?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra's heart skipped a beat when Star said Luna's name. Was that just a matter of Star having already chosen a name for a future daughter, or had they shared the dream? She watched Star for a moment, the tears welling in her eyes. She leaned in, pressing lips to the corners of Star's eyes to lightly dry the tears that slipped out, if they did at all. "Yes. And you were pregnant with another. Your mother was there, on the porch watching Luna in the morning." She muttered quietly. "Did....you experience that dream, too?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's head was excitedly nodding when she realized that they had shared that dream. It had been Star there, genuinely, living that same life with Ellesandra. Fully accepting and happy with that life. Star choked out a tiny, forced-down sob as one hand moved to hold in front of her lips. Just an effort to keep her composure. "Y-Yeah," she said, her eyes getting even more misty despite Ella's sweet attempts to keep her eyes dry. "I-It made me so happy, Ella...Hearing her laugh when you tickled her, I-I...My heart..." She didn't quite have the faculties to coherently express herself, but...Her aura did a lot of the work for her. Love. So, so much love. Her heart was pounding in her chest, trying desperately to keep up with how much it was swollen with this love burning in Star for Ella.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She took a deep breath. Just feeling the love pouring out of Star, the strength of her emotion and happiness at the memory. Closing her eyes, she just held Star, remembering that moment. "Me too, Star." She muttered. "When I saw her, and she called me momma I-..." She couldn't express the feeling, but just like how Star's aura did the work, Ellesandra's did as well. The desire for that, the bittersweet memory of it happening even if it wasn't true right now. The way those words had struck her right in the heart, had touched her so deeply and how much she truly wanted to have that experience. Tears pricked at her own eyes. She couldn't actually state what she wanted, terrified that it wouldn't happen. Terrified that verbalizing it would jinx herself, somehow. "Did you see everything? What happened before that, what happened after?" Did Star see he talking with her victorious and defeated selves? With Freya? See her walk into the trials, or see her walk through the horrendous weather?
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star basked in the beauty of feeling Ella so happy, so fulfilled. Her own heart ached for it just as badly. And feeling how much it meant to Ella, well...It certainly was giving Star a very heavy dose of baby fever. It had a real danger of overriding her inhibitions, making her yank her clothes off and tell Ella to put a baby in her. Except, well...There was still the very tiny detail of how she didn't even know how that would work in the first place. She knew that it was possible. Somehow. But she didn't exactly know...how. That was frustrating, but she could figure that part out once they found her mother, surely. So she just nodded. Being called momma...It made her want to cry just thinking about it. About how happy Ella was in that moment. But at the question of seeing what happened before or after, she shook her head. "N-No I just...I was dreaming about something else, and then I fell asleep in that dream, and I woke up in another dream, which was...Me, there with you. I felt so full of your love and...We were married and...I knew who Luna was, so I asked you to check on her...And I had to lay in bed for a little, feeling that other aura in me and when I came out you two were in the grass and...It ended after we kissed, and my dream went to other, erm...P-Places..." A tiny hint of arousal came with that. Star had a bit of a dirty dream after that, perhaps? Riding on that desire to have Ella put a baby in her certainly might contribute to such a thing.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She nodded at her confirmation that they'd essentially shared the same dream, but that Star hadn't experienced any of the rest. When Star commented on her dream going to other places and she felt that arousal, a sultry smirk crossed Ella's face. She leaned, lightly kissing the top of Star's ear and whispering quietly into her ear, trying to ensure that if Amelia or Amara did wake up they wouldn't hear it. "How many times did I make you cum?" Ella was intentionally being mean, putting those ideas in Star's mind. The idea in her own mind was already there, and her arousal at the idea of making Star orgasm multiple times again had spiked up. Her knee rose between Star's legs, pressing against her heat in curiosity to see if it had been a wet dream, or just a spicy dream. She didn't put pressure, though. She intentionally held herself back from doing anything that might tempt either of them to push for more, with Amara and Amelia so close. Ellesandra was going to take her time with Star for the next few times they were intimate together; a quickie with her knee between Star's thigh was certainly not the type of love making she had in mind for Star next time they were together.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star shuddered when Ella whispered into her ear. This sort of whisper and stoking Star's fires was not helping her baby fever. It was to the point that if she knew how to make it work, she might have pounced on Ella and rolled around in this bedroll with them until she was pregnant with their child. But she did not, and also that probably warranted a proper discussion rather than jumping on it on a whim. As much as she was in love with the idea, it was irresponsible and unfair to their potential future child to take it so lightly, knowing there was still so much that could go wrong. So, Star just shuddered, biting her lower lip, and gave Ella the answer they were looking for: "I-I lost count.." Said quiet as she could, while Ella's exploring thigh would be able to push up under her fluttery skirt and feel the slight dampness between her thighs. Not a wet dream, but certainly one that had turned her on enough that most of the work to get her worked up enough for it had been done by her dream. "I-I'm so madly in love with you, Ella...It's driving me crazy.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smiled widely at the confirmation that Star had lost count. Pride for dream her, getting joy even though she didn't actually do all of that herself. And even more enjoyment out of the feeling of arousal, both from aura and from the wetness between Star's legs. She took a deep breath, working to reign in her temptation to roll atop of Star and do what was necessary to make her dream come true. If Amelia and Amara weren't there, she definitely would. But she was holding herself back for them. At the reiteration of love, Ella leaned down and pressed her lips softly against Stars, a gentle chaste kiss before she whispered. "It's mutual, love." And then, a thought occurred to her. She scrunched her eyebrows together and whispered softly. "Babe...in the trance, how we interact...how do our physical bodies respond while in that? If we were to be in a trance per say...and making loud noises and our bodies getting hot...how noticeable might that be?" Was it a loophole to being able to be intimate while Amelia and Amara were nearby? Potentially. While she'd be disappointed if that idea didn't pan out, she would live with it. If it wasn't an option though, she would begin to pull her leg out from between Star's, just to further distance herself from the temptation to do things to her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star so wished they had stayed in the inn. Separate rooms. Even if she had to force herself to not moan out like crazy, they could be free of this maddening frustration. Of course, it was just the frustration talking. She valued the safe route far more than getting off. But why did she have to be so turned on right now?! She loosed a shaking, shuddering breath, then bit her lip when hearing it was mutual. Then...An idea? She blinked, her mind searching for any reason to go along with this. "W-Well, our bodies don't move. I...I don't know if we make any sounds but...P-Probably not? There's just, well...If my concentration breaks.." They might wake up, as they had before when Star lost concentration on keeping them in the trance. And who could say what might happen if that happened? The threat of it might be enough to make it even more torturous for Star, in a good way, but there was certainly the possibility that no matter how carful Ella was, the two would wake up with Star cumming and moaning with zero restraint, to some very awkward looks from their allies.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

The temptation was there, but that answer hadn't been certain enough for her to try it. Maybe they could experiment with that when they were alone sometime, but right now? She sighed and pressed a lingering kiss to Star's forehead again. A soft hold, and then she pulled away to resist the arousal and temptation there. She wanted to test it, wanted to push Star into an orgasm even if it woke up their companions, but she resisted. Instead, she moved to slide out of the bedroll reluctantly, and then once pulling away from Star for the pure purpose of creating distance, she stretched. The raising of her arms reminder her of the ache in her wounds, and then also that her wounds were healed in the dream, or the future. A glance was given at her arm silently, and then she looked at Star. "Before bed tonight, how do you feel about doing a little bit of healing to my arm? I don't want the scars healed, but the muscles? If you can do a little bit each night so you don't exhaust yourself, that might work well." Ellesandra knew it was a change. Previously, she'd absolutely refused to let herself be healed. The memory of herself putting her thumb against the wound just yesterday morning, and then in the dream as well came back. But she didn't need that wound to remind herself of the pain; it wasn't the only way to do so. And keeping her right arm only minimally useful wouldn't be ideal for the future of this mission. Not that she expected to be able to use it as soon as it was healed - it would take time to build up that muscle again, and reinstate the muscle memory - but there was no reason not to prepare herself to be the best for the fights ahead.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was immediately anxious and longing the moment Ella pulled away. But, she reminded herself. It was easy for her to overwhelm Ella. So she took a breath, and steadied her emotions. Let them have that space. And, well...It did help her, too. She was only getting more and more horny, so much that if she wasn't given that space, she might be tugging Ella's hand down her skirt to rub her until she came on their fingers. Pushing all that out of her mind, she focused on now. And it seemed something had changed for the better. Star's aura and face lit up with happiness at the notion of healing Ella's arm. She nodded emphatically. "Mn! I think that sounds like a great idea!" she said, as if she hadn't already been trying to find a time where she could push that issue herself and try and get Ella to agree. "The bones don't feel like they healed right, so it will take some time, but I'm happy to do that." Naturally, for her to know that the bones didn't heal right meant she had already magically explored the area. But, well, she didn't actually do any healing without Ella's consent. "Though come to think of it, with how our auras have become stronger together, it might be easier than I'm thinking it will be. Hm..." She thought about this for a moment, then decided it was best to just find out with experimentation. "Oh and erm...If you wanted to braid my hair, I'd like that. I heard you before, of course, just...Y'know...Small baby Ella with her big beady eyes and...Ugh!" Naturally, the two talking was enough to rouse their companions from slumber, who wordlessly were rising in their bedrolls and stretching. Star, as well, moved to at least sit up. She was definitely awake now. Maybe a little TOO awake..
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra knew there would be hesitation in her pulling away, but there was no denying that if they didn't, things would get really awkward for their companions. So as she stretched and then looked to see their companions waking, there was a light wince. She felt bad for waking them, but at the same time it was probably close to time to wake up anyways, right? Right. She looked back to Star, nodding at what she said. "As long as you don't overexert yourself with it. Take your time and do it over multiple nights, nothing more than you would get back by sleeping, okay?" She was insistent on this. She wouldn't let Star exhaust herself so that Ellesandra could get an arm back she really wasn't even using much in combat anyways. It was best to take that slowly, whether it was bones or muscle or what. She didn't quite know herself, she just knew both her right hand - where the King had stepped on her hand and crunched it - as well as her shoulder hurt if she moved or stretched them in the wrong angles. Her arm muscles hurt if too much weight was put on them, probably from the wicked slash across her upper arm. All had been patched to stop bleeding, but not fully healed. The small baby Ella comment made her smile softly, before moving to find somewhere to sit, like on a stump or fallen log or something, and motioned for Star to come sit between her legs. "Come on, I'll braid your hair. Good morning, A team." She said, looking up to them after having invited Star over. "I never got around to looking at that map last night, so may I borrow it while we walk today to get an idea of it?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded. She knew it was important to be ready for the next morning. Much as she wanted to get her lover healed as much as possible, as quickly as possible, she would do nobody any good by not being in peak fighting condition in the event they woke up to an emergency. They were on the same page, so Star just needed to temper herself a little. She would do this. But first, she had to get her hair braided. She moved over with them to a fallen log that was nearby, just as the tiny hut spell began to disintegrate. "A-team?" echoed Amelia. "Whatever. It's too early for your senile rambling," she said, then yawned. "Because both our names start with A," said Amara with a chuckle. "Oh, cool, very creative. For a five year old, maybe," said Amelia again as she was twisting her back to stretch it out. "But--- Nngh, yeah, you can have a look at the map whenever." Business was, of course, back to pleasant Amelia. It was only when she could dig at Ella that the attitude came out. Star just stifled a giggle at the antics, taking her spot to get her hair done and sitting pretty for her lover to do so. To do it, she paused a moment, but then summoned from her magic pocket two blue ribbons. They were finely made. Silk, it felt like, as they were handed to Ella. "Here, Ella...These are from my mom, so...Be careful not to rip them, okay?" Not that she thought Ella would do any less, but the anxiousness was clear in her heart and, thus, aura. With how sentimental she had been with Ella's handkerchief from Marigold, it didn't take a genius to figure out how devastated Star would be if those ribbons were broken to torn.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra immediately reached for Star's hair once she was sitting, and the first thing she did was some gentle combing of it with her fingers. She worked out any knots or anything that came up while they were sleeping, running fingers against Star's scalp gently to massage and then pull the hair all back behind her back. She didn't look up to Amelia, focused on this, while she spoke, but she did smile. "Actually, though Amara is right, I call you the A team because I'm pretty sure the two of you are stronger than the two of us. And have more practice fighting together. It's a compliment, Amelia, stop being so snooty about them before you make your old grandmother here whip your behind." There was no intention behind the comment, no sexual intention or flirting, more just teasing regarding the granny line of comments. When Star handed her the ribbons, she held them softly, then nodded to her, and then realizing Star couldn't see her leaned in to kiss the top of her head and mutter "of course." Originally, she had planned to do the crown braid that she'd practiced so many times with Marigold, but after having seen Luna in the twin braids that she'd seen Star in? There was no way that Ella was not going to braid Star's hair the same with, with the little bows at the end of each braid. So, she got to work on that, eyes entirely focused on her work - and obvious practice with braiding hair. She fumbled a little with it, having not done so since her right hand and arm were injured, but it was easy to correct when her fingers let hair slip through them accidentally.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia seemed to be briefly disabled by being complimented. Though Ella didn't see, she froze in place for a moment. Then, the attitude kicked in. "W-Well of course we're better. Duh. But, like, that doesn't mean you aren't half-decent or anything," she said, huffing, then walking off under some unspoken pretense of her morning rituals. The dome flickered away into nothingness once she walked out of its range. Amara just chuckled at the exchange and went off her own way, leaving Star and Ella some privacy. Not that she assumed they specifically needed it, but she could see the obvious closeness. And once they did, Ella got some time to focus on the braiding, and Star got some quiet time to start to process everything she was feeling. And there was a lot. She sat with her back to Ella, but not seeing her face wouldn't stop Ella from knowing just what was going through Star's heart. It started relatively small. A little bloom of love for their little moment here together. But as Star truly started to process what she felt in regards to the shared dream...How she had been pregnant, how that had felt, how they had a daughter and how much joy that brought her, not just for having a daughter but for having it with Ellesandra...That bloom of love turned into a potent, almost agonizing longing in her chest that squeezed her heart tight. Her love for Ellesandra bloomed more, and more, as she quietly stewed in her own thoughts. Her aura began to blossom outwards, as it had done on select few occasions before. It had in the past only been during crisis. But this time? It was the opposite. She was calm. Deeply introspective. Her feelings were...Intense. All of them unspoken, but it came to a head when Star needed to raise her hands to physically clutch over her own heart. She wasn't saying anything or expressing distress; truly, she wasn't in distress. But that little piece of Star that was resting inside of Ella reacted to this all, pulsing with love and longing for Ella. It wasn't said, but rather felt, how every passing second was making Star fall deeper and deeper in love with Ellesandra. Without auramancy one might just think she really liked having her hair braided.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra had heard the stutter in Amelia's words, even if she didn't see Amelia freeze at the compliment. It caused a small smirk, just the right corner of her mouth pulling up in satisfaction at having caused her to actually accept a damn compliment. Otherwise, her focus was entirely on Star's hair. She was gentle as she combed fingers through, then began parting the hair into two different sections, using her knee to hold one section back while she worked on braiding the other. There was an obvious practice to it, the kind of ease that said Ella had spent many a night as a young girl braiding hair. Both her own - which she wore in a single braid sometimes rather than a ponytail - and also Marigold's. The only sign of discomfort was how she mostly used her right hand to hold the hair, versus the dexterous movements used by her left to actually execute the braid. Ella wasn't sure how to handle the overwhelming swell of love that could be felt - and to her, seen - in Star's aura. As it rose she didn't say anything, but as it got to it's peak, where she was afraid that Star might burst like she had in the previous times her emotions had been so overwhelming, Ella carefully lay what was done of the one braid over her leg and then reached down, fingers gently gliding along her cheeks and tucking down just under her jawline. She lightly cupped beneath Star's face and tilted her head up, to look at Ella with Ella leaning over her. A look of concern was on her face, watching Star. "You okay?" She asked softly. Feeling Star's love like this, building and the intensity of it, did a lot to soothe the general concern and insecurity of Star just randomly leaving. It didn't go away - it probably never would, a dark thought in the back of her mind telling her it was all too good to be true - but for now, it wasn't active or overwhelming like it had been yesterday morning. Ella was...happy, as happy as she could be with Star while literally out on the road.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's hair was remarkably soft and free of knots, something Ella would find easily while braiding it. Hair as thick and long as hers certainly ought to have some knotting or tangling after sleeping on it, but...nope. It slid over itself freely, pristine as could be. The feeling of when Star's aura had 'broken' and what were being felt now were certainly different. Star didn't seem to be out of control or harmed by these emotions. They were just...Strong. But strong emotions had proven to be a good thing in terms of auramancy. So when Ella tilted her head back, she was seen blushing up a storm, but...Smiling. Smiling bright and sweet, with a little mist in her eyes. "I'm okay," she responded, just as soft. "I'm just...So in love with you, Ella. I wouldn't say it hurts, because it's not a bad feeling...But it definitely...Aches. It feels like anything we do together that's supposed to calm my heart down just makes these feelings stronger...And I can't help but constantly want more of it. More of...You."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella shouldn't have been surprised that Star's hair was perfect. Like the rest of Star that didn't sweat or get clothes dirty or anything. Yet, it still surprised her there were no knots at all. When she saw the mist in Star's eyes, and she explained how she was feeling, Ella closed her eyes and took in a deep breath. She felt her own heart respond to the words, the ache immediately building there in response. Yet, Ella was much better at ignoring heart ache - positive or negative. She still felt her love for Star, but she wasn't as overwhelmed with it as Star was right now. It didn't mean she loved Star any less than she had before though. After taking it in for a moment, she leaned down and pressed her lips first to Star's forehead very gently, and then down to brush lips. She didn't try to push more, considering their awkward positioning and her not being Spider Woman, but it was just an action to express the words Ella didn't know how to say. Didn't know how to respond, to let her know that she felt the same way. Pulling back away, she began working on the hair again, just about finished with one of the braids and moving to the other. "We'll get there, Star. Maybe not exactly what was in the dream, but something like it." Her words weren't as confident as they sounded when she said them. There was doubt, but the doubt was all about herself. Self-doubt that she wouldn't ruin things, fuck them up, get Star killed. But there was also hope. Ella truly wanted that to be their future, even if she was still trying to work up the belief that they would, indeed, get to that point of having kids and having a home.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star accepted the kiss on her forehead and then on her lips happily. More love bloomed in her heart. Enough to settle her heartache for a few moments, but it wouldn't be long before it returned and she just...Wanted more. After feeling the bliss, the absolute euphoric bliss of that shared dream, she couldn't shake it. It didn't scare her. It didn't put her off. It didn't do any of the things it would have done to someone who was anything less than certain about a partner. For she was certain. She had taken her time to process her feelings, to think about how she felt and what she wanted and how Ellesandra fit into all of that. She had settled into the truth of her love for Ella before she had said it aloud. She had been certain of it. So when the prospect of their future came up, she was already ready to be there. "I'm sure it won't be exactly the same," she said with a warm, unseen smile. Lips still tingled from their kiss. The urge to tackle them and make out for hours was still strong, but resisted for decency's sake. And then Star had a thought, but she also worried...Was it going too far? Would she be pushing Ella with this? She didn't know. But Star was open. She had to express what was in her heart. She just hoped she wasn't going to stress Ella with it: "...Do you like the name...Luna?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra bit her lip, considering. Star couldn't see, but the unexpected shyness in Ellesandra would be able to be felt through the aura. The uncertainty, but shy excitement about the prospect of having a daughter. Or a son or child in general, but because the dream had been with a daughter that's where Ellesandra's mind was at right now. "I...Um." She said, then cleared her throat. "If you hadn't also been in the dream, I was going to keep the name in the back of my mind for...if we ever do....to suggest it." She admitted. She hadn't planned to share the dream with Star, but since Star had experienced it as well, she might as well share that bit. That even if the future seen in the trial wasn't exact, wasn't a matter of 'this is exactly how things will happen', Luna was a good name. It fit with Star's family's celestial body theme, and Ella liked having that be a thing throughout their family. Their family. A connection their child could have with Star and her mother. The type of connection Ella had never had growing up. Not to mention, having experienced Luna look at her and call her momma? There was no way she could suggest naming their first child, if a girl, anything but Luna. "That's..." She took a deep breath. "I want that Star, but I'm...not yet ready to really focus on that. I'm still learning to accept just being with you, and not wanting to run to protect myself." Raw honesty time, though Star seemed to enjoy these honest moments. Or well, enjoy that Ella felt comfortable being so open with her. She had to be honest that a kid wasn't a right now thing, even if they finished their mission tomorrow and were safe. She would need time to feel more comfortable, stable with Star. She had no intention of ever letting a child become an orphan like she was, or with a parent who didn't truly want her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently shook her head. "I wouldn't know how to anyway," she said back with a nervous giggle. "I don't want you to think my desire for it...My excitement about what we experienced there...It'd never override my need to be rational, and careful about it. The thought of something happening on our adventuring that could cause...complications..." Or worse, though unsaid, a miscarriage. "...Just thinking about that would be enough to give me nightmares. Even though I know I wouldn't hesitate to kill to protect our baby it's just...Better to wait, not just because of our dangerous circumstance but also because, well, y-you said it that you're not ready, and I would never dream of pressuring you on that," she said, smiling to herself while enjoying the sensations of her hair being braided. "I just...Don't ever want you to feel ever again like I'm scared, or not ready, or apprehensive or...Any of those things with you. Again I...I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I just...You're my...One...You know?" She bit her lower lip. "I was certain of that before I told you that I love you."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella was quiet as Star explained, and shared her concern about Ella's feelings. She focused on the braiding, letting time pass while she thought, glancing up and around to see that Amelia and Amara still weren't back. Either they'd heard them talking and chose to give them more time, or they had some oddly long morning rituals. She was going to assume the former, even if she wouldn't bring it up to them. She didn't respond until she was done with the second braid, properly tying the second ribbon into it. She was very careful with both ribbons when she did so, knowing how much they meant to Star. Once she was finished, she lowered the braid down and lightly patted Star's shoulder. "It's not you, Star, causing me to think that. Those are me problems, and would be the same no matter who I fell for. I fell for you though, and honestly...feeling it through your aura truly helps. It won't get rid of my insecurities, but it helps. Just, don't be surprised if there are things that are completely innocent you say or do that I just...take wrong. I'll try not to immediately run when that happens, but I'm sure it'll happen again. It's not fair for you to have to try to watch every word you say, either." Because she knew Star would try, if she could.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It certainly did seem like the fluffy-eared pair were finding reasons to not be around, as Star would likely be able to sense if something had gone wrong. Star slowly eased one of her long - and heavy - braids around to her front to admire Ella's handiwork. She smiled at it. A well of sentimentality rose in her. They were just braids...But they were more than just braids. They mattered to her. This style mattered to her. Seemingly random and innocent things had the power to mean so much to someone as sentimental as Star. When Ellesandra began to talk about the situation, she turned on the log half-way towards her lover so she could twist her torso to look at them. She let them finish speaking, but once they had, she moved her hand up to their lips to place two fingers gently against the plush pink surface. A familiar gesture. Hush, said her fingers. She never actually cut them off with this gesture, of course. Just her way of saying they didn't need to explain. She smiled. "You have nothing to explain or justify or anything of the sort. I love you. I know you have fears and insecurities just like anyone else...Though it's also true that, at least in my opinion, people have been unusually cruel to you." She paused, eyes drifting down as her fingers fell from their lips to take one of Ella's hands with hers. A gentle squeeze; she naturally gravitated to their left hand, and any squeezing she ever did with their right hand would be ever-more gentle, barely even a squeeze. "I...Hold myself to a higher standard about this stuff, you know?" she asked, looking into Ella's eyes again. "Being born able to see people's emotions, and all...It doesn't make me a perfect conversationalist, but if there's one thing I always need to hold myself to, it's empathy. So...Just let me work as hard at doing all I can to keep you comfortable as you do fighting those fears and the fallouts of your trauma. I know I don't need to tip-toe around you; I'm still always going to be honest with you. But I hope you can at least understand how...Hurting you, in any way, even unintentionally, is the last thing I ever want to do. I love you, Ella."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella pursed her lips a little when Star placed fingers against them to hush her. Her eyes looked doubtful even as Star explained all this, especially the idea that people were unusually cruel to her. She still, truly, believed she deserved it - not that they were cruel. Okay, maybe the Prince slashing her back with a knife was a bit uncalled for - she wouldn't necessarily defend him - but everything else? She deserved it. She had let Marigold go off, knowing how dangerous it was, for fear of her own job and relationship with Marigold. For fear of losing her ability to be close to the woman she'd loved. In pain at the words she'd said. She'd not done her job, in reality, so the punishment and the anger of her parents was well deserved. She took a breath, wishing the words Star said helped more than just a little. That Star could just soothe all of these insecurities and pains that rose up and made them go away forever. She couldn't, though - even auramancers had their limits in emotional soothing. Ella raised a hand to cup Star's cheek and leaned down, pressing lips to Star's again. Gentle, then pushing in more for a more loving kiss. It wasn't one to stir arousal, not a fiery, passionate, take your clothes off right now kiss. But similar to the first ones she'd given Star, it was one of love. Ella didn't speak well with words, but with actions she could speak better. Just telling Star she loved her over and over didn't feel right. But showing her? That felt right. Ella wasn't quick to pull away, either waiting until the natural end of the kiss or until Star did. And when the kiss did finally end, she tilted her head down to rest her forehead lightly against Star's nose, eyes closed. "We should get ready for heading out. I'm sure Amara and Amelia are running out of excuses to stay away as it is."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The actions certainly spoke plenty, as did what Ella felt in their aura. Their aura spoke plenty to what they felt, and Star had much more firm grasps of how to judge someone based on that rather than what they said. Purest intention was present in the aura, and while it did have problems that arose, things that she truly wished she could be more upfront about, such as what she saw in Marigold the day that Marigold went off to sacrifice themselves...She knew that had to be something that, somehow, Ella came to understand themselves. For the time being, she could just accept that things were complicated, but that Ella loved her, and that was all that mattered. The rest they'd figure out in time. The rest was for the future. And their future, with any luck and dedication to it, was a beautiful one she wished she could see more of. She held her passions and love in focus in her heart while kissing her lover so they could feel it all blossoming from her while she shared in that loving, affectionate gesture that she certainly would not hold back in giving. Something that would take quite some time to come to release, as neither party truly wanted to end it. A natural end had to arrive eventually, one that had her red in the cheeks, but it was a smile all the same that greeted them. She met their words with a giggle, bringing a finger up to tap the tip of their nose, then nuzzled against the forehead that was pressed to hers. "It's okay to just say your heart needs time to feel things, you know," she said, smiling sweetly. "But you are right. Amelia is probably getting close to maximum over-fussy." With that, she moved to stand, extended her hand for Ellesandra to take and hold. Now that they weren't trying to hide it, of course.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smiled seeing the red in her cheeks. An affection for them, and seeing Star flushed, swelled in her. She leaned in, giving a gentle kiss to one of those reddened cheeks. Ellesandra obviously enjoyed seeing Star with a flushed face - for many different reasons, though in a specific lewd scenario most of all. Finally letting go and moving to stand, she would take Star's hand when it was offered. There was no shame or nervousness in holding Star's hand like a couple, though there was a bit of...feeling odd about it. Ellesandra had never been much of a hand holder with partners, but she hadn't ever felt this way about a partner before. She hadn't ever WANTED to do this with anyone other than Marigold, who had been solidly not interested, so the little heartbeat skip that happened from it was new to her. Obviously, they would need to break hold occasionally to get things done, like to roll up the bedroll and get it set up for Star to put in her sleeve storage again. She also moved to get some rations out of her bag and share with Star, so they could eat and be ready to go by the time Amelia and Amara ever got back. "Are you nervous, or excited to be getting close to your old home?" She asked, glancing over to Star to check in with her. Like normal, she was actively trying not to read her aura - not that she was particularly talented in identifying emotions in it - and was relying instead on the conversation to get a feel for how Star was feeling now that they were back in her home plane with a clear destination to the moon plane.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was delighted to feel that excitement in Ellesandra. That nervousness. Their heart skipping. Being able to do with them things they enjoyed, or got excited about, was a delight through and through. She helped out where she could in getting things ready. The question, however, brought a wave of...Pensiveness. She had to truly consider those words. "I don't know if either of those words really encompass it all. On one hand I am glad to see my home again but...I wouldn't say it's nervousness, but there's a certain dark feeling in returning to one's home knowing it will be destroyed when you get there. Dread, maybe? I'm just...Steeling myself for it. But if it brings me closer to finding my mother, then...There's excitement in that, at least. I feel that we're getting closer every day. Nervousness and excitement certainly describe how I feel about finding my mother again." It was about this time that Amara and Amelia walked back in, respectfully not butting into the conversation but doing the last bits to clean up camp to be ready to head out again.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra nodded to what Star said. She...didn't really know how to respond. How to comfort Star. Unlike Star, she didn't really have a lot of practice being emotionally supportive in situations like this. So as the other two returned and began finishing up breaking down the camp, Ella did what she did best in these situations - she changed the topic and introduced humor. Looking at Amelia, she raised her eyebrows suggestively. "You two finally get done making out behind those trees back there?" Of course, Ellesandra had no idea if that's what they were actually doing, and honestly doubted it. If they were interested in eachother, it was likely just a physical thing based on how she saw their interactions, so it'd be closer to a quick fuck a bit away. But, either way, the tease came out. And she ignored the irony that Star and her had literally just been making out like two minutes prior. "We should start heading out to ensure we're there for the airship plenty early. I don't want them taking off without us because we weren't there exactly on time. I'm not sure how strict this military is with times, but I know the one I served in prior would have left right on the dot of the scheduled time regardless of potential non-military passengers."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amelia just looked Ellesandra dead in the eyes with a tired expression. "Really? You're gonna make jokes about me and the captain, who have slept in separate rooms as long as we've been traveling together, while you were just holding hands with Star like five seconds ago?" a comment that had Star unashamedly taking Ellesandra's hand again. Sweet and pure innocence on her face. "If you'd rather not have any privacy I could always just hang around while you two are presumably making out or whatever and make a bunch of obnoxious noises to remind you that even if I'm out of sight I can still hear you two smacking lips when the forest is dead quiet," said Amelia, then drew in a deep breath and huffed. Then, like a switch being flipped, the attitude vanished: "And the captain guy said the airship was due to depart in three days so...We're not leaving today, even if we should probably check in and make sure things are set for us to go. But otherwise I hope you have a plan to kill two more nights."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra pursed her lips together to prevent the smile from spreading across her face, instead adopting a stern look while she 'glared' Amelia down. Star grabbing her hand was returned, squeezing it back and not letting it go or anything. Instead, she adopted a stern grandmotherly tone with Amelia. "I know young whippersnapper but you're grandmother's old bones here need to take it easy and slow on the travel. Don't want me to break a bone by falling do you?" Okay, MAYYYYBE she had missed that he said in three days. But it was easier and more fun to just poke fun at Amelia than to admit that. Turning to glance at Star, she raised an eyebrow, and then unabashedly leaned in to press a smooch to her forehead again. Intentionally making it a wet sounding smooch and slapping her lips to drive Amelia nuts, before continuing. "No reason not to hunt for the day then, see if we can setup an actual campsite closer to Lidiera and hang out there for these few days then. I'm sure any shopping or supplies we need can be bought on a trip into town too." Though Ella was a little hesitant about going into town, for fear that this was when an attack would come and endanger innocents in town. Still, they couldn't just avoid being in towns all together, at least not easily.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The group certainly would need to go into towns at some point, something that Amelia responded to after dramatically rolling her eyes. "I've no qualms with camping out of towns, but after thinking on it some more I do have to wonder if it tangibly would do anything to discourage any future atrocities." She gently shrugged. "Whatever the case, keeping out of sight has its benefits." Amara gently nodded to the assessment then pulled her spear off her back. "Hunting we can certainly do. So long as the forests aren't all full of poison flowers and giant scythe-armed creatures, I'm sure tracking down a fat cow-looking thing or deer will be simple." Naturally, the notion of eating just meat for food did have Star pursing her lips a tiny bit, though she didn't say anything. She obviously could work on gathering, while the others hunted. "Better you and me than grandma, wouldn't want her to break her hip because a particularly muscly rodent bumped into them slightly, now would we?" asked Amelia, firing another grin at Ellesandra. "Besides, splitting up will actually let them make out a bunch, I'm sure. And I'm happy to be far away from that. We can keep in touch with the sending coin, yeah?" asked Amelia, waiting for confirmation that this was a good plan, or if Ellesandra would prefer they all stick together.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra shook her head. Even if it was a small chance, it was worth it in her mind. Yet, with Amara and Amelia suggesting they go out hunting themselves, she frowned. She hadn't actually considered how she'd hunt, but assuming it would be them and not Ellesandra helping felt odd. Then again, she didn't have a bow like she was used to for hunting - and even if she did, would she even be able to pull it with her right arm the way it was? She'd never shot left handed, though she could learn. Either way, it meant that using a rapier to hunt wasn't exactly the most efficient method, anyways. So the A team going off to hunt made sense. "Star and I can scavenge for some fruits or something then. Berries or if we find any fruit trees." She said, glancing over to Star in question at this. "I'm not sure I'd even recognize any of the native fruits here, unless they're similar to those back where we came from? If not, that might actually be mostly you." Though Ellesandra wasn't about to let her go off doing that alone. Another reason she shouldn't be part of the hunting party, come to think of it. The making out comment had been completely ignored, though the idea hadn't exactly left her mind.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled when the plan naturally led to the conclusion of them gathering some fruits and berries. Yes, she did enjoy having something to eat too that wasn't meat, though she imagined Ella would be giving her some meat to add to her food for the day regardless. Time would tell. For now, it seemed the plan was set, and the other two set off to hunt. Star took the chance to clarify: "Some of the plant species are similar here, but also there are a lot of unique fauna to Gurhal compared to other places. I know what to look for, though the sun plane probably has some I'm not familiar with, too. Just in case, if it's not one I recognize, we'll leave it alone. I did spy some apple trees on the way here, about ten minutes walk back towards Neet. I thought we might need to gather, so I made a mental note," she said with a smile. "Hopefully some berries to pick along the way, but I'm sure you can find comfort in something as ubiquitous as an apple. I still want to find out more of your favourite foods, you know, since I don't think honey-glazed duck is going to be just laying on a platter on the forest floor here."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra watched the others head off and truly considered how much space they were giving. They weren't bothered by the relationship, were they? A little bit of insecurity, mostly at whether or not her interest in star had somehow pushed away potential friends, but she shrugged it off, not letting herself focus on it. Turning to look at Star, she nodded at the information, and smiled to the apple trees comment. "Hmm. I mean honey glazed duck could be hunted, if we find bees and also a duck to hunt here. But you're right. You also know I like hot cocoa, and plum flavored ale's. Nuts are nice, specifically almonds but I struggle to crack them with my right hand anymore. Raspberries are my favorite berries, and I'm a fan of cantaloupe." She paused, considering. A lot of these were things that your average person wouldn't get, but she'd been lucky enough to taste in the palace. "Stews are always a good go to, beef or roasted carrots within it. Potatoes and other hearty foods are great go to's as well." She said all this while starting towards the location Star indicated, her hand still holding Star's the whole time. Her head was on a swivel to keep an eye out for danger, but otherwise she was going to enjoy the time with Star. "what about you?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was nothing but happy to have the hand-holding continue. She delighted in it, relishing the warmth and the connection of skin-on-skin that their auras created. It let her feel close to Ella. Not quite as good as a hug or kiss, and certainly fell short of nude cuddling, something she almost suggested to Ella the night before, but anything to embolden the connection the two had was enjoyed. "I'd feel so bad disturbing some bees for their honey...The beekeepers who gather it at least are able to only take the excess, and give the bees somewhere to live that isn't under threat of predators." A stance that suggested at least part of her vegetarian leaning was a moral one. Animals certainly fell into the realm of 'living things' and had their own auras she could see. Still, it was a necessary part of survival in this world. "The hot cocoa is a very cute thing. Almonds are something I think we can agree on being excellent. Raspberries are good, too, but you obviously know they are secondary to my favourite," she said with a giggle. "I like apple pies second to blueberry pies, sometimes enough to want apple over blueberry if I'm craving that specific sort of caramel apple combination. I like passionfruit seeds and melons in general are a safe bet. Oranges and orange juice are always good. Strawberries are a nice treat, and blackcurrant can be as well. If I'm going to have meat, it's nice if it's cooked with aromatic herbs and garlic. Ginger rice is always nice, too. The rice fields in the moon plane make for very enjoyable bowls, and it turns out nice and sticky if you cook it right so that you can mold it into something you can take with you, usually I'd wrap them up in leaf balls and tie them by the stems. They kept for a few days that way before getting stale. Hum...I guess I never had too much fancy food though, Snowhaven has always been a modest place, even though Fletz wasn't too far south. I guess I've never really felt like too indulgent of a person, though I think you can say the same. Stews are a definite staple food that says you enjoy the simple things in life, and I think that's a wonderful thing."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She shook her head quickly at the beekeeper comment. "Oh no I wouldn't be getting any honey myself." There was a...fear, or anxiety there. Ella was afraid of bees. She would never admit to such, but the idea of sticking her hand into a hive to pull out honey - protected or not? Nope, that wasn't going to happen. Not unless that honey was the nectar of the gods and able to save Star's life. Otherwise, bees could stay welllll away from her. She wasn't sure how to feel about the hot cocoa being described as a 'cute' thing, but didn't focus too much on that. She was out of her teen girl years where she wanted to be anything but cute, her tomboy phase. The apple pie comment gave her a smile, and she listened to the rest of what Star said, nodding and remembering her enjoying the orange juice, but when she finished, Ella leaned over to whisper lightly into Star's ear. "Apple pie would be my third favorite. Just behind peach, and number one?" She let her voice drop into a very sultry whisper. "Cream." The arousal and intention of her word was very obviously not talking about the same kind of pie they had just talked about previously. No, though Ellesandra didn't exactly have the right tools to have 'cream pie' the same way it was commonly used, it didn't mean that she couldn't still use it for when her lady came and eating her out instead. After making the comment she stood up straight, the only contact between them still the hand holding, and continued walking forward with a completely stoic face, even trying to reign in her anticipated amusement at Star's reaction, as if saying cream pie was her favorite was not a lewd thing in any way shape or form.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly didn't expect there to be a fear reaction at the mention of bees, but she could understand what it meant well enough. She just smiled and squeezed Ella's hand. No, she would not make them go near any bees. Nor would she judge them for being afraid. As much as she did believe that Ella would face anything no matter how scary, she did still very much recognize that Ella was still human. Them being strong didn't mean they were without fear, even of things that in reality probably would not hurt them to any significant degree. Fears weren't always rational like that. All of this internal waxing about wanting to ensure she stayed supportive of her lover was derailed when her lover leaned in to whisper about cream pies. Star might be innocent at heart but she had lingered around sultry-brained people long enough to know a good amount of the slang, so the recognition was immediate. She squeezed Ella's hand more tightly, face flushing, and clammed up. Though, much as she was blushing and getting embarrassed about it as Ella probably wanted, there was a...Side effect. Of course, Star understood or at least interpreted the term as something that involved Ella getting that other set of equipment below the belt and using it on her. And in the wake of how she felt just a short while ago when they were waking up? Her baby fever came back with a vengeance, and Ella would be all but beat over the head with a rush of arousal from Star's body screaming at Ella to give her exactly that, to rut her and leave her thoroughly spent and impregnated. Star could only keep a squeeze on Ella's hand to stand against the tide of that arousal, indeed having to slow her pace a little for just a moment as her legs wobbled under her mid-stride.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella had not expected that strong of a reaction. She'd been trying to keep a straight face and her anticipated amusement in check, but when she felt just how strong the arousal was from Star she came to a halt and turned to look at her. It was so much that Star's legs began to wobble, and her right hand moved up to lightly rest on Star's back to help stabilize her and, if needed, easily catch her if she fell. "Wow." She said, feeling the arousal had spiked so hard. Apparently, Star liked the idea of a cream pie. The thing was, this was liable to cause a feedback loop. Because her literally feeling how much Star wanted it right now was making her want it to, making her desire to please want to give in to the fact that they were out in the wilderness and probably not far enough away from camp that the A team wouldn't hear them. Her gut clenched and her own hand tightened onto Star's as well. "Ooooookay I will keep those jokes in mind for more appropriate times based on this response." She was both pleased that she elicited a response this strong from Star, and also a little irritated at herself that she'd done so now rather than maybe thirty minutes into their foraging process when it might be safer to actually act on it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star couldn't help but giggle at the response. She was taking measured breaths to keep herself steady, but not too much else was needed for her to be okay and not ravaging Ella right there on the road. She did enjoy the response she got, of course, which did have a loop of arousal run between them, but she kept her cool. "Just because I know now isn't the time doesn't mean my body does," she said, biting her lower lip for a moment. "The idea of s-somehow making that real is, uhm...D-Dangerous. Not enough to compromise my better judgements and all..." Probably. "But I'm not sure what you might expect, giving such lewd suggestions to your lover." She squeezed Ella's hand again with another small giggle. "Talking like I'm not eager to make love to you, repeatedly, any chance we get...Throw putting a baby in me into the mix and of course you're going to make me fussy, ehe."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella smiled and released Star's hand, just long enough to reach back around Star. Her hand rested on the small of her back, then slid lower and lightly squeezed at her ass. Just once, before she brought her hand back around to hold Star's again. There was a sly smirk on her face, along with the tint of a blush at the idea of putting a baby into Star. She'd never considered herself with the equipment to do that - never fantasized about having a penis to further pleasure her lovers with - but Star's comments were making those thoughts come to mind now. Previously, fingers and tongue had always been good enough, but good enough at pleasuring didn't mean anything when it came to trying to start a family, and she had to admit the idea of doing THAT with Star was intoxicating. "Well, how about we go back to kid friendly topics then? Have you ever flown on an airship before? I haven't." And as she considered this, a small spark of that fear came back. She'd never been terrified of heights before her encounter with Valentina, but it was just a little too close to present, remembering the time she spent falling and then the spikes at the end, that she now felt it. It was also good, though. It meant she didn't want to die, right? That's what she tried to focus on, not any irritation at Valentina for introducing a new fear into her life.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star bit her lip and slid her hand back to press over Ella's, encouraging the squeeze. She obviously didn't know the details of Ella's past lovers, but she wanted to ensure that Ella felt like her body belonged to them. She trusted they would never do anything untoward to her, so with that frame of mind, they were welcome to her however and whenever they wanted. There was more than enough desire to match any hunger that Ella had for her. She took another steadying breath when they went back to hand-holding, her face still flushed. Yes. More child friendly topics. Stop trying to figure out if there is a way to give Ella a penis. At least for now. "U-Uhm," she began, clearing her throat. Bit of a sharp change in topic. "I haven't. I know they exist, as do some other relics of the past, but Snowhaven was never really a big city. I liked it like that, of course. But much as this realm is my home, honestly I've...Explored more of other worlds than here. I was still young when I got separated, so it wasn't like I was of age to be wandering around alone. Bit of a different story when that was my only option I guess..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella smiled when Star encouraged the squeeze more. Oh how she wanted to...The thoughts that went into her mind were immediately pushed away before she was actually tempted to take action on any of them. It didn't, however, stop her arousal spike at the idea of Grabbing Star's ass and hoisting her back up against a tree and...Yep, okay, those thoughts were back. She cleared her throat and looked away, putting an effort on focusing on the topic at hand and distracter herself by doing another visual sweep of their surroundings for dangers. "How old were you when you got separated? You might have mentioned that before, or how long ago it was when..." She paused, realizing that she didn't know how old Star was. She looked back at Star, frowning. Had Star mentioned her age, maybe when sharing that she was a virgin? The thought nibbled at the back of her mind, but if she had the information hadn't stuck. "And how old are you? You're not actually like some five hundred year old who still looks to be in her twenties are you?" The comment was made mostly teasingly, though knowing it was a legitimate option.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled upon feeling that arousal kick around despite trying to be rid of it. The struggle was real. The question about how old she was brought her attention back around. Indeed, she hadn't mentioned any of that before. "Oh. I was thirteen at the time. It's been...Ten years, now. I'm twenty-three," she said with a giggle. "Definitely not some five hundred year old who looks like this, though I understand that auramancy does allow a woman to age gracefully." Which was to say, not really show any sign of age. Something that Ella would find that, because of that piece of Star inside them, would apply to them, as well. Something that wouldn't really be observed for a decade or three, however. "How old are you? I guess the fact that we never talked about basic stuff like that is a testament to how much crazy stuff we've been a part of since meeting, huh?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella shrugged. "I'm at the ripe old granny age of 24." Her voice dropped into a mock grandmother voice, all cracking and everything, like she did when throwing jabs back and forth with Amelia. Humor was a good distraction for arousal, right? Either way though, they continued towards wherever these apple trees were. "Lets see. I've never been on a date to know what kind of questions to ask there, at least not one where the obvious ending wasn't sex and that was the purpose of it, so I'm not used to what questions need to be asked for getting to know one another. We already talked about favorite foods. What about things to do for fun? Surely your whole life isn't just dedicated to travelling on the road, there's things you enjoy doing, hobbies and such?" She looked over to Star and leaned over, smooching her cheek. "And saying me isn't a valid option, since you've only done that once." Okay, Ella just couldn't help herself. Teasing Star was too much fun, whether or not it caused arousal issues.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star giggled. "I never really understood the whole grandma angle. What if Amelia is older than you?" she asked, now wondering how old the other two were. "That'd ruin the whole joke." The jab at arousal did work as intended, though the cute smooch to her cheek and it being light hearted did mean it was just a tiny little pulse of 'I want you' in Star. Easily ignored, if she must. The two were just about at the place Star had noticed, and some apple-bearing trees could be seen from the road. "I've never been on a date either. Uh. Period. So. I can't really help you from that angle. But as for getting to know people, I've got lots of experience at that part," she said with a smile. "I really like music, and dancing, and...Well, I guess I could say a lot of things, but the root of it is that I like anything that brings people together, you know? Anything that lets me be close to others, to bond with people, those are things I like most. I like to read, too, but even with that I'd prefer it if I could read while I was leaning against you, that we could stay close even if doing solitary things. I know 'reading for fun' is kinda a big nerd answer," she said with a giggle. "But I like stories. I like seeing things from other peoples' perspectives and experiences. There's also a lot of stuff I think I'd like but, well, have never really had the time. I'd like to tend to a garden someday. A big one, full of pretty flowers." She smiled again. "Your turn, you tell me some stuff you like now."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella rolled her eyes at the grandma question. "It's because of the silver hair. Like I'm an elderly human woman with aging hair. I got it all the time as a kid, people would call me grandma. Not sure why my hair is silver, versus any normal human color." She didn't exactly remember her parents to know if theirs was silver as well, and hadn't gotten any information from the people who claimed to have been the ones to kill them. She'd been a little too focused on her own grief at the time to give them any attention at all. As Star listed off things she was interested in, Ella nodded. "Well, I can't relate to the reading one. Learning how to read was torture and I still mess it up a lot. My brain just doesn't work for it for some reason." She shrugged. "But the rest I can. Music and parties are great, especially if there's no threat at hand so I can do a little drinking." She paused, then clarified. "Not that I'm a drunk, but a bit of alcohol helps loosen my feet up some. I'm great at waltzes, in case that ever comes up." She winked at Star, all but asking to dance with Star if that happened. She turned serious, considering again. "I think the thing I enjoyed the most was training, or sparring with others. It was a physical workout, but also helped better my skill. And it's a good way to get to know someone, at least someone who is trained themselves. It's quality time together, and you can both share experiences and knowledge." She shrugged. "That's what I did in most of my freetime before...but I haven't really done that in a while. It's why I was so interested in watching the training in Myst. You can learn a lot about a person by the way they fight, and there is a thrill in being in the middle of that." She looked up at the trees as they approached, then did another visual sweep around them to ensure no one was around. Once confirming, she turned and lightly guide Star's back into the tree, immediately stepping up against her and smiling the small bit of distance up at her. "Of course, there were other things I enjoyed doing at night. I think I can show you some of those another time. But for now?" She leaned in and kissed Star. Gentle, but she'd been wanting to kiss her and at least let out that desire for a while now.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star considered what might be the source of Ella's silver hair. Did that have anything to do with their innate magic resistance? Both were fairly unique traits, though she didn't automatically assume that meant anything. She had white hair but unique hair colours were common in her family. "My mom has silvery hair, though it's not quite the same shade," was all she had to add for the moment. She smiled at the notion of Ella at a party, relaxed, having fun, not always stressed and looking around. The talk about training wasn't something she could relate to, but she didn't need to relate to it to understand and appreciate what Ella was saying. As long as they enjoyed it, and had their way of connecting with it, she would always support them. Though obviously, she would make for a terrible opponent in such a case, not least of all because she would never be able to bring herself to hurt Ella, even if it was in training or something. But she was certain that Ella only ever set their sights on other martial fighters like Amara when it came to sparring prospects. She was about to ask what Ella might have learned or enjoyed most about watching the fights that did go on, but then oops, now she's being kissed. Thoughts went flying out of her head and she melted into the kiss, loosing a breathy, satisfied sigh. Her arms moved up to wrap around Ella's neck and her eyes closed, fully devoted to the loving and tender kiss. The swirls of arousal and love were intermingled and fully bared for Ella to feel, showing without inhibition just how much she loved kissing Ella, even if it was in the middle of some random forest when they were meant to be picking apples. If they came back empty handed, well...It would tell their allies a lot.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella didn't know what the cause of her hair was. It being related to her abilities was honestly possible, but she didn't have any true indication of it. She'd also heard of people greying/going silver because of stress, and part of her wondered if something in the attack had caused her to go silver? Though her hair was already silver when Marigold found her, so that didn't make sense. She didn't remember any of that anyways. As Star responded to the kiss though, Ella let out a soft sigh of contentment through it. The way Star just melted into it, immediately returning it and wanting it, made her heart beat harder. Her hands dipped down to Star's side, and she forcibly prevented herself from exploring more with her hands. Instead, she kept them on Star's hips and just held tightly while pressing herself up against Star. She didn't press herself too tightly to Star, but having not been wearing armor the contact still did a lot. The lack of armor had been an oversight this morning, something she normally wouldn't do if it weren't for her being distracted by Star, but it helped out now that she was pressing her torso against Star's for a bit more closeness during the kiss. The kiss would end naturally, unless Star pulled away, with her head turning to press against Star's shoulder to catch her breath. She wanted to just...make out with Star, but they did need to get some fruits and stuff. Apples, at the very least - the rest they could claim they didn't find anything on the way. She breathed heavily, and then turned her head to press a very gentle kiss against Star's neck. There was only one before she pulled away, afraid that doing too much of that would turn Star on too much, but she couldn't help herself doing it some. Oh how she wanted to kiss, suckle and nip at Star's neck, to get her aroused and get her whining against the tree, but she resisted. "You're a drug, Star." The words came out strained with the intensity that Ellesandra's arousal was spiking, her need for Star, but again it was restrained.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star made a few whimpering moans into Ella's lips while they kissed. It felt incredible, and its effects were immediate and obvious. Of course, she knew they had to be responsible but...With her lover kissing her, their hands on her hips, she was struggling to keep that in mind. Her form trembled under their presence, the grasp they held on her, the heat of their lips, the passion of their kiss...Her heart was pounding in her chest. "M-Mmh...Nmmh..." Little sounds of pleasure, things Star had never made until she met Ella, and would only ever make under the weight of her lover's passions. Her hands held onto Ella's neck, fingers curling into their top and hair. Not rough, just...Needy. Ella wasn't the only one having trouble resisting, of course. She was tempted to do something very naughty, but...She kept herself behaved. For now. When the kiss broke and they settled to just hold each other, Star's eyes remained closed and her breaths, shuddering, pushed heavily through her lips. "M-Me? W-What about you?" she breathed out. "I've never felt such powerful desires until I met you, Ella...You drive me crazy, constantly.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella took a deep, stabilizing breath. Star's noises, and the obvious need she felt from her, was really hard to resist. The noises made her own thighs tighten, having to force her arousal down as she began to get...more than just a little wet. Pulling away from Star to create some distance, she took a few deep breaths and continued walking around around the tree to look at the apples. Doing her best to distract herself. "So. Apples." She said, trying to focus on it despite the husky sound to her words giving away her arousal. Part of her really wanted to just say fuck it and, well, fuck her. But this would still only be Star's second time, and not only did she deserve better than just being fucked against a tree in the woods, but also she didn't want to cause any discomfort for their companions if they could, in fact, hear them. So she would control herself, and set about looking for apples to pick. "I'm not quite sure if there's a limit to how many of these we should get, or if we can tell any are bad? I've never picked apples before."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was left panting and pressing her own thighs together when Ella separated from her. She...Needed a minute. While she definitely wanted to keep with the themes of tenderness with Ella for now, there was certainly a point where horny overcame her sensibilities and she was liable to say fuck it, and then 'fuck me'. Thankfully, she wasn't there yet. The focus on apples brought her back down a little. Biiiiig, shaking breath. She then nodded. "...Apples," she echoed. Then, hearing that they had never picked apples, she genuinely had something else to focus on. "Oh, well, picking them off the tree can pretty much guarantee they haven't spoiled, though if they aren't the right colour they might be under-ripe. Best to just give them a little squeeze. If they are firm, but not hard, they are good. If they are squishy, probably pass on them. If you cut into one and the inside is green, it's too early, and if it's a nice creamy white, then it should be good. Most of the apples that are overripe will fall off the branch long before that." Evidenced by the apples on the ground, most of which were either dirty or well overripe. The branches hung low in many spots, low enough to pluck. As Star explained, she produced a wicker basket from her magical pocket. Unsurprising that someone who liked fruits and berries and such would have something like that, likely. "As for a limit, well. They stay good for a handful of days, though they might get bruised if you stuff them in your pack and they jostle around. They're a nice snack, at least I think so, so just grab as many as you want." Of course, there were many higher up that wouldn't be accessible without climbing the tree or some sort of ranged ability to grab them, but for just four people there would be a decent amount in grabbing range from the forest floor.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra focused on the apples and did her best to ignore the shaking breaths from Star. The need. Instead, as Star seemed to come down from her arousal high and focus on apples again, Ellesandra focused on which ones were close to the ground. It was situations like this that she regretted being as short as she was. It had it's uses in many cases, allowing enemies to underestimate her and such, but in other situations like this she wished she was taller. Seeing the wicker basket appear in Star's hands, she raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Came prepared did you?" Another glance up at all of the apples. "Wait though, so are we not supposed to cut them to check or are we supposed to cut them to check their ripeness? Cutting them sounds like a way to make them ripen faster to the point they'll go bad quicker right?" She said this, even while reaching up to some of those ones she could reach and lightly tugging them off of a branch. She wiped them off and inspected, then moved to place them down in Star's basket. "And apples are nice to eat as a snack while on the road, I just never picked them myself. They were a good thing to pick up in markets as something I could eat and walk through lunch if I was trying to get somewhere quickly."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled sweetly at the notion of her being prepared. "Of course!~" she chirped pleasantly. "Oh, and well, yeah, if you cut one open you'd have to eat it then, assuming it was ready. It's just if you're not sure, is all. Just look for the ones that have lost all their green and are at least mostly red, and they should be the good ones. Like the ones you'd see at a market, you know," she said, trying to not overcomplicate something as simple as picking fruit, even if there were other things that one could do to confirm the ripeness like check the colour of the seeds, which also required opening the apple. "Worst case if you bite into one and it's either mushy or too hard, just toss it on the ground," she said with a giggle. "Nature will take care of the rest. It's like applesauce for the earth." Star wasn't really much taller than Ella, so they were resigned to the shorter branches, but that didn't leave them wanting terribly. "There's something serene about just being in nature and taking from its bounty, don't you think? Not to sound like a nature-obsessed druid or something, and I'm sure if this was my job I'd tire of it plenty quickly. But just here...With someone you love?" She smiled, letting that thought trail off, and a little serene smile formed on her lips as the happiness radiated from her. This was nice.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

"Mm." Ella responded in confirmation at the 'with someone you love' comment. The idea of Star being a druid reminded her of Sia's partner, who was a druid, though Ella hadn't been particularly close to her. She'd seen her occasionally and was friendly in the way of you being friendly when seeing the spouse of someone you worked with, but that was about it. Still, thinking about that made her think about how Sia might be doing now, and that had dipped her mood just a little. She tried not to let it though, and turned to look at Star to distract herself. "Well, I think I want more apples, so..." She stepped up towards Star, putting her hands on Star's shoulders to keep her still. And then she bent her knees, lowered her arms to wrap around Star's waist, and then hefted her up. There was a twinge of pain in her right arm, but it was ignored as she tilted Star to put most of her weight on her left side, and then bounced her up lightly to dip her hands down beneath Star's thighs and hold her from there. This effectively would put Ellesandra's face in Star's bosom, while Star was now about a foot or so higher than she was before and would surely be able to reach higher branches. Ella squeezed Star's thighs playfully, smiling up at her. "Apple picking team."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the dip in the mood. A concerned look was natural. Just a quiet wonder what might have caused it. She didn't press, but she was mindful of their mood. If it dipped further, she might need to check in. But before she could consider that, she was being lifted! "K-Kya!" she called out, her hand not holding the basket coming to rest on Ella's left shoulder to stabilize herself. She blushed bright, but after a moment, she smiled down at her lover. She bit her lower lip, staring at her lover for a moment even though she knew they were holding her up and, despite her light weight, was still going to put a strain on them. "...I love you so much, Ella," she said, gentle and affectionate. Her heart, and aura, swelled with that spoken of love. Just a small moment for her to bask in that feeling, then she did as she needed to and reached up a bit higher than she could previously to grab at some of the heretofore unreachable apples.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Star was right, there was some strain there, but it was mostly because she was putting more weight on her left arm than her right. In fact, she'd adjusted her left hand to essentially cup Star's ass - not the intention, but certainly a welcome byproduct of this - to take on more weight while her right hand mostly helped with stabilization. And then she slightly leaned backward so more weight was on her legs to hold, rather than just her arms. Still, she would only be able to keep this up for so long, so despite wanting to tease Star and kiss at the areas she could reach on her chest, she didn't. She just felt the love from Star and wordlessly sent the same feeling back in turn, before carefully walking around to allow Star to reach the higher up apples. After a few minutes of this, she grunted and slowly lowered Star back down to the ground - not before considering pressing her against the tree again, but resisting that temptation - and then straightened up to brush Star's skirt down and ensure it was modest and not wrinkled or stuck up on something from the awkward position. "Okay, apples done. Any suggestions on berries or should we just take our apple haul back instead?" Ella hadn't seen anything of interest on the way here, but she had to admit she'd been a little distracted with her arousal of star to be looking for berries. Instead, the times she'd looked around, it had been for signs of danger - not for foraging food. They could always take a different way back so that they had a different section of woods to search as well though, if there hadn't been any on the main path.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't want to strain her love unduly so she was swift with her motions. They had quite a haul of apples, and Star was happy to carry it along even if she could probably send it to her magic pocket. There was something peaceful about carrying a wicker basket full of fresh fruit. Of course, she couldn't just leave it as is, and had to help herself to one of the apples, but only after offering one to her love first. "I don't know if there were any berry bushes along the way, but we'd get a better look if we went back through the forest instead of along the road. It'll be slower, sure, but we're in no rush, right? Can stop and smell the flowers, as the saying goes? Literally, if there are any flowers to find, ehe.~" While she spoke, she still had plenty of love to radiate to them. Some arousal, too, though she was trying very hard to not focus on that. Too much and she was gonna end up pinned to a tree with Ella between her legs. Which...Tempting.... "It's kinda disappointing that Amelia seems to have caught on to us. I had a plan for how I wanted to do it and everything, even if we wouldn't have been able to see her immediate reaction."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

When an apple was offered, she took it and sniffed at it. Not because she expected it to be bad or anything, but just because it was a habit to sniff at fruit before eating when out on the road. It helped it taste better, she'd been told, to focus on the scent as well as the taste. Then she took a bite, listening as Star suggested they stop and smell the flowers. A lewd thought entered her mind, about how she wanted to smell Star's flower, but she refrained from saying it. If they were going to make it on this adventure without humping eachother constantly, she would need to refrain from as many lewd comments as actually came to her. Instead, she nodded. "Sure." Another bite, still chewing when Star revealed she'd had a specific plan for how to break the news to Amelia, and Ella tilted her head curiously at Star. "Oh? What were you planning?" It was asked with a mischievous tone, a smile building on the corner of her mouth as the potentials ran through her mind. Waiting until Amelia was eating or drinking to just turn and kiss Ellesandra, to maybe doing something more forward and lewd to just get Amelia's surprise. Or maybe calling Ella babe? She'd considered calling Star babe previously that morning, but hadn't wanted to because it sounded to....like something she would have done with any of her past lovers. Star wasn't that.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star giggled, chewing her lip with a little bit of playful mischief about her. She was never a lewd woman, at least never around other people. Things had changed since becoming an item with Ella. She was more comfortable being lewd. Ella being lewd encouraged her to return in kind. A little back and forth that, as much as they explored each other, they also influenced each other. "W-Weeellll...I knew going into this that this might be a little bit of a tease," she admitted, open and honest as ever. "Buuut I wonder if I should tell you...It might make you want to do something drastic right now. Because alternatively I could just wait until we have a chance somewhere private to just...Show you?~" An implication that whatever she was going to do was very likely going to lead to sex, naturally.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra stopped dead in her tracks. She looked over to Star with narrowed eyes. The desire rose and she took a breath...and then stepped forward, placing the remaining bits of her apple back in the basket. She'd eat it later. Then, she gingerly took the basket from Star, and moved to set it somewhere safe. They were in the forest now, a bit away from the road, so they had enough privacy. Oh, sure, the A team might hear them depending on how sensitive their ears were and how far away they'd gone for hunting, but Ella no longer cared. Star wanted this, she wanted this. She was going to stop holding back, and just make sure to treat Star gently so she didn't feel like some random whore Ella was fucking rather than her love. Stepping up to Star afterwards, she leaned in and kissed her jaw bone. There was no denying her intention as she kissed up to her ear, having completely dropped the pretense of fighting against her arousal. Her breath tickled into Star's ear before she whispered - "Show me. I dare you." Challenging Star to do exactly what she'd had planned. To start this - to ensure that even if Ella was inviting it, Star was the one who would start whatever came next. That her consent for that would be more than just implied via their arousal.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could see what she was inviting, and aside from the fact that someone might wander the road and hear them, she wanted it, too. Damn the consequences, said her body. Her arousal was spiking the moment Ella took the basket and she put together what was coming her way. Her aura told the story. Yeah, she wanted it. The arousal, the excitement. She loved the idea of Ella making love to her, and though she knew that they weren't going to end up comfortably snuggled up on the forest floor nude and cuddled together in sweet tenderness, she was okay with it. She had her tenderness, and there would be more of it. She would need more of it. But that didn't mean she couldn't indulge arousal in its more raw forms, too. Truly, if they were going to keep this arousal in check, some amount of 'screw the cuddling and fuck' was probably going to be needed. So Star stepped back into the tree, hands moving to the tree bark to curl her nails into it as she craned her neck to let Ella at her jaw. At being dared, she bit her lower lip again while considering what she was going to do. And in true Star fashion? She was just gonna be honest about it. "I was hoping we'd end up in a similar situation, our room next to Amelia's, alone at night...And I was going to back up against the wall adjoining theirs, just like this," she said, with motion to her back being against the tree. "Then.." then, she moved her hands from the tree to slip under her frilly skirt, thumbs hooking into her panties to pull off her hips and drop down to her ankles. Then, those hands smoothed up her thighs and daintily grasped at the hem of her skirt, slowly tugging it up to reveal her bare, soaked petals between her creamy thighs. "Then I was going to tell you to make sure she hears all of it."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra groaned into Star's neck at what she said, and what she could feel Star doing between them. There wasn't any stopping her arousal now; it was in full control of Ellesandra's mind. She moved her hands to Star's hips, and then down, beneath the skirt that Star had raised for her. She gripped tightly at Star's outer thighs, breathing heavy, and then began to slide her fingers up and down the skin there. As much as she wanted to just fuck Star, she would still try to make it a more intimate fucking than just getting her arousal sated. Turning her head, she spoke in a breathy whisper to Star's neck. "Fuck, Star." And then her lips were pressed to Star's neck. Up, down, and around as she continued to just stroke Star's thighs, circling over to the front as she pulled her body away just enough to adjust where her head was. Kissing towards the front of Star's neck as well. This time, she tested very small sucking actions, just enough to cause a sensation difference and not so strongly she'd leave a hickey. And then her lips found that pulse point and she ran her tongue along it again, just like she'd done last time. Lips closing over it and sucking gently, then kissing, then kissing down her neck to her collarbone. She wouldn't tease Star nearly as long as she had last time, her fingers already beginning to slide closer to her inner thighs, but damn was she not going to tease a little. To make sure Star was good and ready when she did get around to touching her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Hearing Ella groan was payoff for all she was doing. It would have all been more of a shock if she had pulled that for Ella out of the blue instead of warning them ahead of time, but that was okay. She was going mad with arousal and no small amount of baby fever. She needed to be calmed down, or she was going to do something reckless. Years upon years of self-denial and abstaining from any sort of physical pleasures ensured that Star was sensitive as could be, lips hung open from Ella's ministrations as hot breaths left her and legs trembled under the weight of her own desires. She had been told outright that Ella was a pleaser. She had felt how they could quite literally get off just by getting her off. So it was a little experimental, but her thoughts led her down a path of just making herself as sexy and desirable for Ella as possible, egg them on, and then let them unleash on her. So far, so good? Seemed to be going well, not that she could really think too clearly anymore. Her head craned more to let Ella at her neck, and with her needing to support her own weight, and with Ella's hands on her thighs, the trembling in her legs would be easily noticed and far more prominent than it had been when she was relaxed in bed. A contingency for catching her if she lost all feeling in her legs was probably wise, given how hard her legs were trembling under the skin already. "E-Ella.." she called out, her breath already falling short. The sensation of sucking was met with a bit of novelty in her aura. Something new. Good, though tentative. Too much of it would prove to be overstimulating for the sensitive girl. It did provide a nice rush of heat to her core, however, and a little more drooling of arousal between her thighs. She was already good and ready, but it was also true that Ella could certainly work her up more and put her on a hair trigger again, if they so wished.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra enjoyed the sounds Star made, the soft little noises. It shouldn't come as a surprise that she was working herself up with all of this just as much as she was working Star up. She began kissing and licking at Star's collarbone while her hands moved into Star's inner thighs. Gently spreading Star's legs to give full access, and to widen Star's stance so it would be easier for Star to remain standing, she dragged fingertips up her thighs and then massaged gently, encouraging them to hang in there, to hold on and keep Star upright. And even still, her right hand moved around, gently sliding against the underside of Star's ass - what she could touch that wasn't pressed against the tree - and set itself there as a support for if Star's legs gave out entirely. She might not be able to catch her with her right arm and stop her from falling entirely, but she'd at least be able to stabilize and control her fall if it happened. Meanwhile, her left hand moved to run along her wet labia, on the outside so as to not stimulate yet but still coating themselves in Star's arousal. The feel of her heat and wetness on her fingers made Ellesandra take in a sudden, sharp breath and groan again. She wanted Star so, so badly. And this is why she didn't tease more. She herself wouldn't be able to handle it. Ella didn't go right for Star's clit, though. No, she slid just her middle finger up and down along Star's slit, kissing back up her neck and to the other ear she hadn't gotten to yet. She was careful not to let any movements from Star cause her finger to slip inside, ensuring that she was fully coating her long middle finger in Star's arousal. And then when she did get to Star's ear, she placed the tip of her fingertip right at Star's entrance. Not entering, but there, ready to. Teasing the entrance, running around the opening, but not inside. And then she whispered - "Is this okay?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star would make a lot more sounds as Ellesandra began to kiss at her collar and moved their hands around her inner thighs. The lick that had been done on her pulse was tender and intimate, but what she was responding to more in the moment was the more sultry touching. Of course, she would never be devoid of needing Ella's intimacy, but she still had a lot of pent up horny to work through, and some experimentation was in order to find what she liked. Even if more heated rutting was not destined to be her favourite, the craving was certain to come up now and then. On this day, she needed her lover in a more impatient way, though Ella was right to ensure she still mixed in the tenderness Star adored. The hand moving between her thighs to give attentions to her labia might not be terribly stimulating, but it did very much still make her legs quake from knowing what was coming. Her back arched, pushing her clothed chest out a bit more as her head leaned back into the tree. "N-Nnnnhhh.." she moaned, her 'messiness' making itself known at Ella's touch with a sensitive rush of arousal to flood over Ella's fingers and drip down between them while her inner walls squeezed tight. Ella prodding her entrance evoked some nervousness, because of course it would. A new sensation, something she knew might be painful. But despite that anxiety, she wholly accepted Ella. That acceptance was felt, then said aloud to confirm: "Y-Yes, Ella...I'm y-yours. I belong to you. All of me. P-Please...Take me however you want, my love.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra groaned out again at her request, at her begging to be taken. She timed her finger slipping into Star with her teeth lightly catching the bottom of Star's earlobe. Having learned form nipping Star's lip that she wasn't a fan of nipping, at least there, Ellesandra didn't actually close down with her teeth to cause any pain, but pulled the earlobe into her mouth that way and ran her tongue along it, before sucking. This was done at the same time as her middle finger sliding into Star, gently parting her. Ella was extremely gentle with this part, knowing it was her first time. The thing was, many partners were impatient when it came to this, and if her hymen was intact being impatient would lead to her breaking it roughly and causing pain when it wasn't necessary - this was also why she'd only used one finger. Instead, she let her finger slowly slide in, slowly stretching Star open and accepting the addition of something inside of her. Slowly moving to press down on her interior walls that were already squeezing from arousal. There might be some blood, and some discomfort, but what a lot of girls described as painful for their first time would turn into a feeling of discomfort instead, at most. Of course, all women were different, but Ella was keeping in mind Star's experience with it as she penetrated her lover for the first time. Then her finger slid out...and back in. These first few strokes, out and in again, weren't designed for pleasure - Ella wasn't curving her finger to hit any specific spots. Instead, she was gently guiding her finger against Star's walls, letting her experience the sensation of someone inside of her, of getting used to what this would feel like. Of ensuring this wasn't something that Star absolutely hated.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

It was quietly sentimental for Star to be able to offer Ellesandra the chance to do this to her. While it wouldn't be any less special in her mind if she wasn't a virgin before meeting Ella, there was also a part of her that was glad that she was, that she waited and was able to give everything to her chosen lover. The small romance to it felt nice. So it was with a small brace that she prepared to give one more thing to her lover. Her virginity had already been lost to them, in her mind, but this was one lingering facet of it to surrender. She slid her arms around her lover and held them as she prepared to receive their finger inside her. It was...Certainly novel. Her lips fell open and her legs quaked. Not enough to make her drop, but definitely straining her as those shockwaves of pleasure and discomfort burned through every muscle in her body. The discomfort was initially the superior sensation. She had to shut her eyes tight, and her teeth came back down to clench as her hymen was slowly, delicately torn. The blood from it dripped down onto Ella's singular finger as that first penetration was given. Small sounds of hitched breaths as she held the pain in graced Ella's ears, discomfort offset by the tingle of pleasure from attention to her ear. Teeth weren't bad, though it was clear that she did prefer the more gentle motions over nipping. Naturally, given their earlier conversations and the whole baby fever burning in her, Star had to imagine what it would feel like if this digit inside her was something else entirely. That little fantasy had some more wetness, hot and plentiful, flood over Ella's finger to drip down onto the waiting hand below. Star didn't hate it. She needed to adjust, but...After some time to do so, the finger in her was accepted and squeezed. The pain would give way to pleasure, as well as plenty of delighted moans, assuming Ella didn't retreat entirely.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella had moved from Star's ear to kissing at the skin behind it, then down to her neck again. Her right hand gripped tightly to the bottom of Star's left thigh, still working to support her through the pleasure that seemed to be burning even more in Star now that the discomfort was gone. The moans fueled Ella, just as they had the last time they'd done this. Her arousal spiked hard when she was hearing Star's pleasure, and in this case, actively feeling it around her finger. Once the discomfort and pain had mostly gone away, Ellesandra had begun curving the tip of her finger to rub along as it came out, working to increase the rhythm slowly. It wasn't until her finger was going in and out at a steady pace that she stopped and pressed her ring finger against Star's entrance as well, slowly spreading her to accept a second finger within. The first two strokes were just as gentle as her first with one finger, ensuring Star could easily spread to accept the added size before she began to build up speed quickly again. Her breaths were coming quickly, and her kisses became a little wild. Along Star's neck, jaw, shoulder - she focused less on kiss with intent, and more just a desire to touch skin with her lips as her entire focus was on the movement of her hand, and the feeling of Star's pleasure and arousal increasing. Her own thighs clenched together as her own need built more and more, and she began to add just a little bit of clitoral stimulation into her thrusts with the palm of her hand. Rubbing her hand up and down along all of Star's slit with each thrust, ensuring that every other time she entered her palm pressed lightly on the bundle of nerves, but then gave it a break in the next thrust. She wanted to ensure she didn't make Star oversensitive before she was ready to cum, but she was also certain that doing this would help build her quicker. And by Torm, Ella wanted to hear Star come against this tree, with her skirt hiked up, in the forest. The entire thing was so hot and arousing she was struggling to keep her own arousal in check.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was powerless under Ella's assault. She had thought she would do a bit better the second time around, be more prepared to handle the levels of pleasure that were going to be pushed unto her. She was not at all prepared for this, though she welcomed it all the same. Each push of their fingers into her evoked a sharp, heated moan once she got used to the feeling. She was clinging to Ellesandra with a very real fear that she was going to fall down if she didn't, even with their support. Her face was burning hot. They were in public. Sure, it was a forest, but for all she knew someone could wander by at any moment. She'd be able to sense them, naturally, but what went further, her aura sense or her moans carried on the winds? Probably the latter. And she was moaning. She was moaning and if the other two were gonna hear her, it was too late to stop herself from behind heard. That was a problem for later, not-horny Star. She craned her neck as needed to let Ella's lips wander all over her, and she was more or less paralyzed in contrast. She held onto them, but that was about all she could do. Her body felt like it was splitting in half, her heart was pouding, chest heaving. The stimulation to her clit made her legs and hips shake and her back arch with each press of their palm over it. Too much was certainly possible, but she was wet enough that not only was Ella's palm swiftly left slick, but the gliding of their palm over her was thusly slick enough that it was just the right amount of friction on her sensitive pleasure bead. "E-Ella..Ella...E-Ellaaaaaaaa!~" she moaned, interspersed with needy whines. "Y-Your fingers feel so g-good...I-I'm...I'm gonna cum for you, d-don't stop, p-please d-don't stoooop!~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella shifted her left leg so it was between Star's, just behind her hand. This way, she could gently thrust up with her hips, both allowing her to provide a different sensation for Star as if she were being fucked by fingers, rather than just fingered. This was also doubled by Ella whispering to her - "Imagine my fingers like I'm about to make our dream a reality." Oh, she knew her fingers weren't a penis. She also had no idea how a penis felt like, so she wasn't sure what that comparison would be, but Star didn't either. If Star closed her eyes while Ella thrust up against her, would it be so hard to imagine that it wasn't fingers, but Ella providing the cream pie she'd promised earlier? She wasn't sure if that was better or worse for Star, but considering how turned on Star had gotten earlier at the idea of being mated like that, Ellesandra thought that would be a good way to ensure Star was at her peak arousal when the orgasm came. And as Star began to moan out louder, saying her name, and saying she was going to cum. Asking her not to stop, Ella's groan joined Star. She thrust up, both supporting Star's weight with her thrusts and left hand as well as causing her palm to press more against Star. There were wet noises coming from between Star's legs at how aroused she was, how 'messy', and Ella loved every second of it. She clenched her teeth, at least on her part trying not to be so loud, as she worked to push Star into her orgasm. And through it, her right hand left Star's thigh just long enough to grab Star's hand, pull it down, and place it between Ella's thighs. Over clothes, it didn't matter. Star would feel her heat, her arousal, and as she pushed Star into an orgasm, Star would be able to feel her thighs shaking as she did too, only added by having put Star's hand to cup her at the time. To feel her touch, as if she was a little embarrassed to be cumming simply from Star's orgasm, without at least a little touching herself.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The comparison might be something that drew upon a void in her mind, having no idea what it actually felt like, but that didn't really matter. Her imagination filled in the blanks, and the idea of them impregnating her certainly had her heat rising to the boiling point much faster. Her inner walls clenched tight around Ella's fingers, as if trying to milk them dry of the seed of life they didn't carry. Truly, that vision of the future had given her quite the desire to be filled. It was a dream, all right. In a literal and figurative sense. It was everything she wanted. And she held that in her heart as her hand hastily moved not over Ella's clothes, but shakily dipped down under them to move between their legs and onto their bare sex. Shaking, gentle strokes were given, responding to her lover's call for pleasures. She was fumbling and uncertain with her motions, but she was guided by her auramancy as with all other things. What felt good, she did more of. Specifically she gave tender, circular motions with her fingers on Ella's clit in much the same way her tongue had given their last time together. She remembered that much at least, even as she was about to lose her mind. Of course, she was right on the edge as she was pushed to this point, so her hand was left shaking under the weight of what was a swiftly found and powerful orgasm. Her back arched, head threw back slowly, and she moaned out loud enough for the good people of the nearby fort to hear as her legs quaked, her inner walls tightened, and then ultimately brought her to a sharper series of moans in line with a wave of clenches that squeezed Ella's fingers like a vise, relaxed, and squeezed again in sharp pulses. And of course, this left plenty of her arousal to squirt out of her onto Ella's hand while also soaking her inner thighs. Her aura burned with the pleasures she felt, and though it was a different sensation to the intimate and slowly-gained orgasm that was her last, it was certainly satisfying all the same and put a damper on the ravenous hunger she felt. Quenched? Not even close. But subdued, for now, as she fell into the afterglow of shaky, whimpering moans.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella hadn't expected Star to fumble beneath her pants. She groaned even louder when she did though, smashing her sex against Star's hand. It didn't matter if Star wasn't dextrous in this position, or practiced, or able to hold her shaking back as Star came. It was just her touch that pushed Ellesandra even further over the edge into her own orgasm. As she felt Star cumming, literally on her fingers and on her hand, Ellesandra's groans were muffled mostly into Star's neck. Her own body shook with the pleasure, the joy at feeling Star come apart against her again, feeling her literal wetness at her orgasm, and she pushed harder to get more and more. Unlike last time when she'd got Start to build up and then slowed down, this time Ella continued fucking Star through the orgasm. She did slow down and pull her hand back a bit from Star's clit, but she didn't stop. Star's moans were literal music to her ears, like an angel from heaven, and Ella wasn't ready for it to be over. So as she continued, her own high coming down, her right hand had returned back to Star's ass to ensure the continued stimulation wouldn't cause her legs to finally give out - or that she'd be supported back against the tree if she did. While Star's moans had been load, Ella's was more manageable in how muffled they'd been, but Ella still wasn't sated with Star's moans. As long as this didn't feel like it was too much for Star, that she wasn't being pushed too far, she kept pushing in, curling fingers to specifically find Star's g spot, and when she found it she began massaging it on each thrust, fully intending to send Star into a second, quick follow up orgasm.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

// Good morning! Just wanted to pop in to let you know I will be busy today. Having to go into the office for the day. Have a good day and hope all is well!
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had expected to slowly come down from her orgasm like last time. That didn't appear to be the case. Her lips fell open and eyes visibly rolled back in their sockets under the onslaught of pleasures that rocked her body in crashing tsunamis. Her legs visibly were shaking, and her moans sustained their loud, uninhibited releases. Each breath in was raspy, each breath out was a heated, heavy moan. She wanted to speak, but words were beyond her. The overwhelming pleasure was felt through her aura, spilling into her lover for them to feel how incredible it all felt, how riding on the coattails of one orgasm was carrying her along to her second before long. Her hand in Ella's pants was more or less paralyzed, aside from its trembling shivers. She managed to almost say her lover's name a few times, but it was cut off by heavy moans that displayed her pleasure-filled delirium fully. And with Ella's practiced fingers, it wasn't long before orgasm number two hit, which built up to a head swiftly and hit her like a pile of stone bricks. Even tighter clenches, a redoubled, messy squirt all over her lover's hand, and then a final, heavy jolt of pleasure up her spine that was the final straw for her legs, which promptly gave out and, supported by Ella's hand, was mostly controlled as she fell down to her butt, legs shaking, whimpering moans leaving her, and legs quaking heavily as aftershocks rocked her body and smaller, shrinking squirts shot from her sex until her orgasm - eventually - subsided enough for her to just...Fall limp against the tree trunk, soft blue panties around her ankles, and quite the shine on the grass in the patch below her. Star had enjoyed the loving and tender orgasm more, probably, but there was no denying that this is what she needed in this moment. Her arousal had definitely been forcibly cooled off, for now. Her right hand naturally had retracted from Ella's pants when she fell, and in her haze, all she could do is just...Bring those wet fingers to her lips and shamelessly lick them and slide them into her lips to suck clean.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella supported Star while fingering her, feeling the increase in pleasure again and the quicker peak of a second orgasm. Like before, her heart swelled with pride and joy at feeling this in her partner - not just with her fingers by feeling Star's muscles squeezing her, but also through their aura and just how much pleasure she was pulling from her. As Star's legs had given out during her second orgasm, she helped lower her gently onto the ground, a grunt as she did and lowering with Star, her fingers never once leaving Star as the aftershocks came. She had, however, stopped thrusting, simply leaving her fingers inside while Star recovered from the second orgasm. There had been a little bit of pride in how Star had gone literally speechless throughout it, but now as Star was beginning to recover, she finally slipped those fingers free. Her pupils dilated when she saw Star tasting her fingers, and so Ella brought her own fingers up to her own mouth and mirrored Star. She groaned again, and pulled away from Star just enough to lower her head down between Star's legs. She was going to claim the taste of her prize - even if she did so gently and without actually putting her tongue or mouth on Star's sex. She licked and kissed along her wet thighs and outer labia, but knowing how sensitive Star surely was she didn't actually go to the source. There was something to be said about potentially pushing Star towards a third orgasm and giving her the experience of being on the edge of oversensitization, of how it heightened pleasure and you could find that perfect balance point between the pleasure and the discomfort it caused, but this wasn't the time for that. Not only was it only their second time and she felt she needed more trust and comfort from Star in regards to sex, they were also still out in the forest, in a not comfortable and entirely safe environment. Her breathing had calmed down when she moved back up Star's body, pressing a gentle kiss to her cheek, and then her lips, before moving to sit next to Star. She leaned down and took Star's panties, gently working them back up on her legs and up her body, and then leaned back against the tree with Star and pulled her head over onto Ella's shoulder. This was as close as they'd get to full on cuddling, but it was still body contact, and she reached across to lightly run soothing fingers up and down one of Star's thighs. Massaging the muscles that had shaken so hard the muscles had given out. Her gentle massaging and aftercare was wordless, transitioning from a hunger to make Star into a mess that couldn't walk, to the concern and care of helping Star afterwards seemlessly, wanting to take care of her and make sure she was okay.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star very much enjoyed the sight of Ella between her legs. Even if it wasn't for them coming in to send her over the edge a third time, there was a...Trust. An intimacy to that position. Only Ella was ever going to be between her legs like that. It was a sight that she would only be able to enjoy with her lover. She knew Ella had their worries, but to Star she had already found her one and only. So her clean hand moved to stroke tenderly through Ella's hair while they were getting a taste of her arousal. Her inner thighs through to her sex were coated, but the open air was cooling and drying it swiftly enough. There was no denying the scent of sex that clung to her now, though. When they stopped licking up the fruits of their labour, Star was happy to have them by her side to lean against. She slowly came down from her high, giving a few tender kisses to Ella's jaw while trying to catch her breath. "I love you, Ella...So much.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

"I know, and something must be wrong with you for that." She commented. It had intended to be a joke, but it kind of hit the truth a little too closely to be entirely brushed off. She turned to kiss Star's forehead and changed the subject, like she was so good at doing, in an attempt to prevent Star from trying to convince her otherwise. "How much you want to bet Amelia and Amara still heard that? As well as any travellers on the road. They can probably smell it too - we don't happen to be nearby any rivers or anything do we? Washing off the scent of sex might make us better travel companions." Ella was already trying to consider comebacks to what she imagined Amelia might say. There was a chance they didn't say anything, pretended it didn't happen so as to not have to talk about it, but there was also a good chance that Amelia poked fun at her for it and claimed it was such a horrible thing to have to listen to while on the road together. Thinking about this was also a pleasant distraction from the idea of Star somehow loving someone as broken as her, and dwelling on how much that wasn't fair for Star.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was wise to Ella's distraction game at this point. She moved one hand up to Ella's opposite cheek to gently turn their head towards her so she could kiss them on the lips. A tender, loving kiss. Affectionate, with tender strokes of their cheek with her thumb to punctuate her adoration. She wasn't trying to light a fire. Just show her love. So she didn't linger long. She rest her forehead on theirs. "Stop that," she said, soft and gentle. A smile lingered on her face, showing she wasn't chiding the woman seriously. That she knew they meant well. "Nothing has ever felt more right."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella smile, pressing into the kiss a little to taste herself on Star's lips - and to give Star a taste of herself, as well. When Star pulled away again, with tender stroked to her cheek, she closed her eyes and just took in a deep breath, letting it out in a large sigh. "Tell that to Amelia when she chews our heads off for not keeping it down like she requested." And then, immediately as if afraid Star would take that to heart, she clarified - "Not that you should, I absolutely love hearing you." That also wasn't necessary to clarify. Ella's main enjoyment from sex was feeling and hearing her partner come undone - she'd said that before. This was even doubly so feeling Star's aura and the pleasure through her, as well as the more romantic, intimate connection they had. She wanted to just prop Star up on an altar and worship her for days until she had drawn every bit of pleasure she could get from Star's body. And then rest for a few days and do it again. Ella would be a very happy woman just doing that. Still, their relationship had more substance than just sex, which Ella wasn't used to. And in a moment like this, after sex, she felt...awkward. She didn't know how to address things, so was relying on humor. Normally post-sex haze was an easy thing to flirt through, but Star wasn't just a person she'd fucked. Ella loved her. The thought caused her to turn and press her lips softly into Star's cheek again before doing a casual glance around the woods, to ensure no one or nothing had approached while they were distracted.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled. "In a heartbeat," she said to Ella's demand that she face Amelia about it. She wasn't afraid of Amelia, though she also knew things about Amelia that Ella didn't, or at least, might be more nervous about pushing. Star knew what Amelia felt, and could push things a bit further while still knowing Amelia was comfortable with what she said. An unfair advantage, perhaps, but whether Star's gift was good or bad did very much vary depending on the situation and one's own perception. It certainly had caused bumps with Ella in the past. She then scrunched her nose playfully. "And don't worry. I'll make sure you always hear all of it, my darling." Another kiss on their cheek, repaid for the one given to her. Unlike Ella, Star always assumed the best with anything anyone said. She didn't blame Ella for one second for the difficulties they had; betrayals on the magnitude that upended Ella's whole life certainly had done the damage and left the scars. She loved Ella no matter what pain they held. Nothing had approached the two while distracted, as this did seem to be a very less-traveled area of Gurhal. "I think I'm okay again. The uh...Baby fever definitely did...things...to me. You're...Sure you don't want me to do some stuff to you, maybe?" she asked, her cheeks going pink. "It kinda goes against a lot of what I was told by friends in the past that it's okay to be all...selfish with receiving. It's not that I doubt you when you say you enjoy that dynamic. I certainly feel it. I guess I just get a little anxious about wanting to be the best partner I can be for you." Anxieties that Ella would feel, though they were mild. Her trust in Ella superseded those doubts, so minimal reassurance would be needed in this moment.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella shook her head, obvious discomfort rising in her aura. She looked away from Star, out into the forest, speaking softly. "I'm sure. Just your hand on me was enough, and..." The discomfort and vulnerability rose as she tried to feel comfortable saying something she hadn't told a lover before. Previously, she'd just say no if they tried to go down on her or do anything with her as a focus. "I'm not comfortable with others focusing on me like that. I don't really enjoy that aspect of sex, my own orgasm. I told you before that I prefer to focus on the pleasure of my partner. That can take many forms, and when it's like what we did that first time where we pleasure eachother - that's okay. But just to be there while someone focuses on me?" Ellesandra shook her head, her body unconsciously scrunching up as if making itself smaller. She lowered her head against Star's, the side resting against Ella's gently while she looked away. There was that insecurity again. Not in her physical looks - Ella knew she looked good. Maybe not as tall or as strong as some women might like in their tops; she wasn't 'butch' in the standard way, but she was still good looking and she recognized that. No, it was in the deep seated belief of her not deserving that. Of feeling deeply uncomfortable with anyone loving her, and if she wasn't returning the attention or affection it was too uncomfortable for her to just be there and let someone show her affection only. The discomfort with that dynamic outweighed the pleasure that would be given from it. Finally, she said - "It just doesn't work for me, really." A cop out, rather than explaining all that complexity that Star could surely see in her aura, but this time it wasn't her trying to avoid it. She just, didn't have words for it. Didn't know how to express that she felt unworthy of such attention from a lover.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could see it all. It made her frown. She had thought it was just some sort of preference. It didn't change anything with respect to how she would approach things, at least in the near future, but she didn't like this source. She didn't like seeing how it stemmed from a root of undeservedness, of such insecurity. Star leaned more fully against Ella, knowing it would take a hell of a lot more than just saying they deserved love and affection and to feel it to help them overcome such pain. "I understand," she said softly. "I know where you're coming from. And whatever it takes for you to enjoy yourself, I'm prepared to do." She kissed their cheek again. "I have a deep desire to give you pleasure and affection, too, but...We'll just stick within the bounds of what you're comfortable with. Promise." Of course, that promise did come with a tiny caveat that she was hopeful that that comfort zone would expand in time. But truly, she wouldn't push Ella sexually. That was not the time or place to push someone. Emotional acceptance would help, in time, she hoped. "Just means if nothing else that I'll just have to think of more ways to be sexy for you, hm?~ If I can't tease you with touch, then it'd only fair I find another way to do it." Encouraging words, words she hoped would bring Ella comfort, that she accepted them. Because she did. It just was also true that she hoped, someday, that Ella could accept her giving them love and affection solely.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt the acceptance. The love shared in response to her insecurity. She closed her eyes and just...accepted it. Or tried to, as much as she could. As Ella claimed she was going to need to find a new way to tease her though, Ella turned to smirk at her. "Babe." She said, both testing the word and how Star might respond to it while they were alone, and also wanting to get her attention. "You tease me just by existing. But I'll give you a hint. I especially adore anytime you get flustered about something, and just feeling that you're aroused? That does a lot for me." She leaned in, and whispered into Star's ear - as if anyone else might be eavesdropping or something. "And if you really want to get me going? Make groaning and moaning noises in normal day activities. As if your tea tastes particularly delicious you can't help but make noise. And stare at me as you do. Subtle, but that will drive me up the wall." In hindsight, maybe she shouldn't be sharing this type of thing with her. Then again, it got them off the topic of Star focusing on her during sex, so it was fine. She moved to slowly stand, and held out a hand for Star to help her up. She would fully take on Star's weight on her left arm to help, and to balance Star to ensure she could get her legs under her and they would continue to work, rather than collapsing under her again. "We should see if we can find a river or something to do a quick wash in before heading back. I actually don't want them to feel like they have to sit in the smell of our sex the whole night."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's aura responded with a flutter of love upon being called 'babe'. Not any specific attachment to that pet name specifically, but just any pet name would achieve that sort of flutter of affection. Being told she teased Ella just by existing was a nice confidence booster, and warmed her cheeks a fair bit in turn. She then listened to the whispers, biting her lower lip. Being told exactly what to do was in some ways nice, though some part of her hoped she would have been able to figure some of that out herself. Though, she never would have figured out moaning during normal daily activities. That just wasn't something she would have the confidence to do without knowing it would work, so it was a give and take. When offered to be helped up, she took the hand offered to rise to her (wobbly) feet. Not quite fully sure in her stride anymore but she would manage. The basket of apples was picked up again as well. "R-Right, uhm...Sensitive noses," she said. She wanted to talk more about Ella's insecurities. She wanted to talk about them all night, give all the reassurance she could. But she remembered what Ella had said. How they were much slower to process all these things. So she set about trying to find another way about it, some way that was slower and gentler. Getting upset and yelling about it obviously was the worst attempt so far, something that had a tiny tint of self-loathing flash in her aura. It came, then went again after a minute or two once she let herself feel it. Despite that, she didn't show any lost smile, or any lost blush. The love, the arousal, definitely still outshined it all by great magnitudes. "So...On a scale of one to ten, how does 'skirt lifting' do it for you, then?" she asked, giving a coy little smile at her lover as she set off in an eastward direction. Maybe not a river, but if nothing else she knew there was the ocean that way for them to wash off in.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella squinted her eyes when she inadvertently felt that self loathing from Star. She watched Star curiously, left hand out to wrap around Star's waist and walk that way both as a way to support Star while she regained her full footing, but also just a way to touch her while walking. Ella didn't bring it up though, unlike what Star surely would have done if the situation was reverse, and instead turned out to look in the direction they were going. The comment about skirt lifting caused her to grin. "It's great for situations like this where we don't have an actual bed and full privacy to do something. Hot, in these situations. And maybe something where if our arousal is just...intolerable, to get it out. But honestly? I preferred taking time to fully remove all of your clothes in the bedroom. To tease you that way, and to be able to truly appreciate all of your body - not just what's beneath your skirt." The thing was, Ella enjoyed the risk of doing things like this semi publicly. And there would be a desire to do things regardless of being in public, but she was too cautious and too mindful of other people's comforts to ever actually act on anything if others were actively in their presence. As much as it might be tempting to slide her hand up Star's skirt, with Star sitting on her lap, in a group environment and see if she could encourage Star to be quiet during it, she never would actually do that. The risk just outweighed the reward of it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star leaned against her lover as they walked. She liked the contact. Them not wearing armor was mildly concerning but she did at least appreciate that they could touch more fully while Ella wasn't wearing it. She just hoped this would be a day that didn't have any fighting. She hoped every day would be. But she knew that was a lofty desire. Ella explaining what skirt lifting did to them had her giggling, while blushing. "Don't worry...I much prefer you taking it slow with me, too. There's nothing that can replace the feeling of us cuddling in the nude. It's...Incredible, actually. The intimacy of our bodies fully touching and tangled up is probably one of the most fulfilling things I've felt. Ever. N-Not that I don't love the teasing and pleasures, just...I guess it's why even if we do stuff like...This..." Hopefully not in a way that would get them caught someday. "It's only something I'm okay with because we've already had that intimacy at least once. I wouldn't be able to do that sort of thing without feeling as close to you as I do. And, uh, well, on a completely nonsexual note, you'll also have to get used to the idea of cradling our little girl against your bare chest," she said with a sweet giggle. The baby fever was subdued for now, but her mind was still circling it. "It's a little quirk of auramancy. It's a very soothing, strongly bonding experience for someone with this gift. I know you kinda got the gist of that, like when you took your armor off that one time to hold me. And obviously us getting naked and cuddling up is only something we can do in secure privacy but...We could do that all day, every day, forever, and I'd still not get enough of it, eheh.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra looked confused for a moment at the idea of cradling their little girl against her bare chest. Was Star implying that she'd need to breast feed her? Ella honestly wasn't sure how that worked - she'd never considered it possible for her to be a mother, considering her interest in women and also feeling of unworthiness in general. Nor had she grown up with a mother or siblings in a situation where that would happen. There had been some brief conversations with Marigold when she'd realized she was pregnant, but that had been too soon before her death for Ella to have learned a whole lot about how that worked post birth. She shook her head, realizing that it was just a matter of auramancy and wanting that skin to skin contact. She stopped them, turning to smile to Star. "If things are ever overwhelming for you and you need that comfort, but we're in public? As long as I'm not wearing armor, you're welcome to..." Ella lifted her shirt, and then just put it over Star's head before pulling her into an embrace. Effectively pulling Star down so that she was hugging directly into Ella's chest, while sharing a shirt. It would be easier if Star came up through the bottom rather than Ella lifting the shirt to put over her head, but the point of this was still made either way. Bare breasts beneath her shirt were happy for the comfort of Star's embrace, even if it was only held briefly before Ella pulled her shirt back up over Star and stepped away. "Just so you know, I'm comfortable with that. I'm not exactly shy of being topless in public either, as long as you're not going about kissing and sucking on my breasts." That, and the potential for someone to ask about her scars were the only things she wouldn't like about that idea.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was fairly surprised to end up with an offer to get under Ella's shirt. She took it, giggling a bit as she did, but was sure to put a few loving kisses right over Ella's heart while she was under there before basking with her cheek against the same place for just a moment. She indulged in it and enjoyed it while it lasted, but didn't overstay her welcome. "I don't know if I could ever match your boldness, Ella," said Star, a bit meek and with red cheeks, paired with a nervous glance away. The ocean coast came into view at this point, with a break in the treeline and a sandy beach out before them. "I-I'm sure I'll be fine, my love. I prefer the privacy and intimacy we can share when we're alone, but it's reassuring that you'd do that for me. I'd do the same, even if I might die of embarrassment from being topless in public..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella enjoyed the kisses above her heart, though she wouldn't admit it. She liked Star's closeness just as much as Star did, but she was also uncomfortable with how much she liked it. And felt like she needed it. So when they were back to walking the way they had before, she smiled down to Star's reddened cheeks. "You're adorable when you blush. I have to hold myself back from making you do it all the time." It made her want to kiss Star, too, and sometimes she just had to hold back from all of it. "And I'd never ask you to be topless in public, especially if it makes you uncomfortable. But, when you work on my shoulder tonight, I suspect I'll be topless then and with Amelia and Amara around. I don't exactly have a shirt that you can easily access my wounds while still covering the rest of my body." Again, Ella shrugged. She truly didn't seem bothered by the idea. "If that ever bothers you though, let me know. I'm comfortable with that, but I don't want to make you overly jealous or anything like that if Amara or Amelia happen to look at me and like what they see." Because Ella knew Star would be able to tell if they responded to Ella that way. Even if Star wasn't telling Ella anything she saw anymore, it was still acknowledged that Star would be privy to more information about others than Ellesandra would be.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

That didn't need to actually happen for Star to feel jealous. The thought of it was enough. That flash of jealousy flowed through her. Ella was sure to feel how the notion of someone else wanting Ella sexually made Star feel possessive and maybe a little defensive. Not enough for her to show it on her face or say anything, but their connection let Ella feel things that Star previous wasn't letting show. The ugly emotions, of course, for she always was sure to show her happiness and sadness and all those other things on her sleeve, open and honest. Star nodded, all the same. "It's no big deal. Though having my hands up your shirt should be enough, probably." She wasn't sure, and she did need to make sure that healing Ella was not compromised by some modesty concerns or her jealousy. But she took a page from Ella's book and just moved on from that topic before the jealousy could be focused on. Whether Ella allowed it, she'd find out shortly. "So what do you need to do once your arm and hand are better to get them back to being conditioned? Is there anything I can do to help that along?" She probably could do some magic to help that, though she'd have to wing it on that front. For now, she was just holding onto the love that was fluttering in her chest at being told she was adorable when she blushed. She might not have said anything directly to that, but the feeling was there. Ella loved her. Found parts of her genuinely adorable. Wanted her, in more than just sexual ways - but those ways, too. And it consistently, constantly made Star happy. So she'd just let herself blush. Let herself be a little flush in the cheeks. She had little reason to fight it before. But now she'd be sure to not cover it up, so Ella could see it, so she could soak up all their affection and attention whenever it came her way.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella noted the feel of jealousy at even the idea, and considered that. She didn't push the topic back to it, though, when Star changed it. She'd only shrugged at the hands up shirt comment, unsure what Star would need for the healing. As she considered the next question, Ella moved her left hand to rest on Star's opposite waist and squeezed gently. A small reassurance, a gentle hold so that Star knew Ella wanted to touch her. Appreciated her. Had affection for HER, not for others. A minor attempt to reassure the brief jealousy she'd felt, even if Ellesandra didn't address that feeling directly. "I'll need to rehabilitate it. The muscles will need to get stronger and be worked again. I'm sure I'll still have some muscle memory with it, but I'm not going to be able to just pick up a spear or shield or anything with it and use it effectively right away." She paused, then added. "Once it's at a point that I can use it though, I'll probably switch my rapier to my right hand and do some practice at night. Maybe I'll ask Amara to spar with me to keep me on my toes and see how it does when actually attempting to parry a blow. We'll see how far the healing goes for it though, please don't feel pressured with it at all. It...would be nice to be able to use it for more than just the smallest things, but it's also not worth you exhausting yourself over. If you're thinking of it as getting me in battle shape for what's up ahead, I doubt I'll be in a place to use it for any of this unless we take a really long time to find your mother, and that's not ideal." She was honestly concerned that Star would think like that, would pour more energy into it than she should. "And remember I want the scars still. Just repair the bone and muscle beneath."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star listened to what would be required and silently nodded. The two arrived at the beach edge at this point, transitioning to walking on soft, warm, white sands, soon to be upon the waves. There were no other figures in sight on the beach, though it wasn't extremely long, as it was broken up on either end by rocky outcroppings that broke up the coast. Still, room enough for a dozen people with plenty of space between. Star's heart swelled with love upon being held, upon feeling the appreciation. It was reassuring. It did what it needed, calming those woes in her heart and replacing them with pleasant, warm feelings. "You better be careful sparring with Amara.." she said quietly, with a little pout, and...Another small flicker, some small bit of jealousy. "I'm not pressed on time for it or anything but...I do want you to be healed. I of course won't touch the scars." Even though she really wanted to. "It might be easier to rehabilitate it if I'm helping, but, we'll see. Remember that...The more we empower our resonance, the easier it will be to heal you. Not just now, but any time. Not that I'm trying to pressure that, I know you said last time you weren't sure about it." Even though they already ended up more strongly bonded because of their lovemaking anyway. "Just...It scares me, you know? You being hurt. I can't lose you, Ella. I can't."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella glanced around at the beach when they got to it. There was a bit of appreciation for the sight, even if she wasn't much of a beach gal. It was a nice way to relax and bathe themselves, at least. The comment about sparring with Amara caused her to look at Star with a frown and a quick rise in suspicion, for reasons Star almost certainly didn't intend. Ella didn't quite know what she felt from Star, the jealousy? Or was it something else? The warning put Ella a little off center though, listening to the rest of what she said, and only really coming back to the conversation fully when Star expressed fear of losing Ella. Taking a long, deep breath, she reached out and pulled Star in for a gentle hug. "You're not going to lose me, Star." She whispered softly. "No death, remember? We agreed. I won't do anything silly or reckless like I normally would to go get myself killed." She took Star by the shoulders and pulled her back enough to look her in the face, serious. "I promise. But, we need to circle back to that last comment. Why is sparring with Amara something I need to be careful of? Is she upset at me, or want to hurt me for some reason?" No, Ella hadn't jumped to the idea of Amara being attracted to Ella. Instead, she'd jumped to the idea that Amara was a threat, and her feelings towards Amara at that point were very guarded. "Surely she's skilled enough to not accidentally skewer me on her spear."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was reassured by them saying 'no death' and reiterating it. There was a time back in Myst that she felt how little they meant it. The reassurance was needed to stamp out that old memory, and make her truly relax on the subject. It might require a bit more proof, but for now it was enough. Her anxieties would certainly rear their head again before long. She gulped, nodding to the promise. As for the spar with Amara, she blinked, then shook her head. A bit more jealousy came up, which she didn't fight, as she did not fight at least feeling her emotions, though she didn't let it affect her. "It was little more than just my wanting you to be careful. I know how much you enjoy that stuff, and even if you're both skilled I just worry if it involves you. I love you, so...I feel a little protective. It makes me nervous that one of you might slip and someone will get hurt, or she'll hit harder than you expect and injure your arm again. I know for certain she'd never hurt you on purpose, at least." She twirled a bit of hair around one finger, here, flushing a bit red. A pouty look washed over her as the jealousy had her looking to the side. She didn't say it, but she certainly thought the words 'it isn't her spear you need to worry about skewering you, just her fingers'.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt like Star wasn't telling her something, but she got the feeling she shouldn't push on it. If it was something that was actively a danger for her, Star would have told her. And anything else was probably gotten via Star's ability to see Amara's aura, in which case Ella didn't want her sharing that. The sense of jealousy she got again, though, give her a suspicion as to what it was. Surely it wasn't from anything Ellesandra had felt towards Amara, was it? She gave Star's forehead a kiss an then moved to step away, taking off her clothes to prepare for the quick rinsing she would get in the ocean. It wouldn't be perfect - her panties certainly would still smell like sex for her, since she'd not removed her pants and such prior to her own orgasm - but it'd be better than them reeking of it at least. A glance around was given to ensure safety before laying her rapier down atop her clothes and stepping out into the water. When she was chest deep in it and could glance around to ensure there was nothing in the water that was a danger, she turned and spread her arms for Star to join her. "Come, let me wash you." Said with a smile. She wouldn't push on the jealousy point, but when Star did join her? She'd take a moment to wrap her arms around Star, and say low and seriously. "I'm faithful, Star. Whatever it is that's causing you to feel that, you can trust me. I...know I don't have a history of relationships like this, but I wouldn't, ever, do that to you. Okay?" And she hoped that Star felt the seriousness and honesty in her words, since that's all she had to offer. She couldn't prove her intention to not do something unless she just, didn't do it. But Star would feel her honesty and authenticity, at least.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star hadn't expected them to be getting naked, but in hindsight...What DID she expect? She wasn't sure. But still, a tiny spark of arousal rose up in her, seeing Ella nude. It was ignored, because she was still feeling good after her dual orgasm earlier. But still, she liked what she saw, obviously. So she joined along with Ella, stopping once she had disrobed and put their clothes in neat piles together so she could touch each pile, flooding a bit of magic into them to make them immediately pristine. It would have done little to do so before washing themselves as they would just get stained again, but them being able to change into them once clean would mean they would feel freshly washed and air-dry. A bit of nervousness at being fully nude in public was clear, but she didn't see or feel anyone nearby, and it was just Ella, who she had no reservations being open with like this. She smiled, and a burst of love and happiness came at the invitation. Something about being told to come, to let them wash her, made her heart flutter. So she did, moving closer to her lover with her large braids bouncing mirthfully with each step. She moved into her lover's arms once she was in the water, to whatever depth Ella had chosen. She loved the sensation of their bodies pressed together, and the fluttery love and happiness in her was clear at the full-on body contact. This was just what she had been speaking about, and the comfort she felt from it was immense. She held her lover tenderly, hands on their lower back to avoid the scars on the upper half of the their back. She gentle shook her head to Ella's words. "I don't have any doubts about that now. When we weren't an item, sure, I felt a little worried you might want someone else. More my own self-consciousness than anything you did...But..." She shook her head again. How did she say this without it just being a roundabout way of telling Ella what she saw through Amara's aura? She was actively struggling with how to say it, and it was clear.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Well, they weren't going to be able to wash themselves without getting naked, right? She'd watched as Star just cleaned their clothes though - that was a neat little trick. As Star moved up into her arms, she squeezed Star and placed her chin on Star's shoulder, fully embracing her. She also used this moment to eye the shore line and make sure there wasn't anything or anyone watching them, before she shook her head at Star. "No need to explain." She had already guessed that Star was struggling with it because if involved someone else's emotions - whether that was Amara's, or Amelia's, or unrelated. "I just wanted to reassure you, that just because I've not...been serious about anyone before, didn't mean that I'm not serious about you and only being with you." She didn't release Star, right hand still wrapped around her waist, but began running her left hand up and down Star's back, gently massaging and rinsing her, going up and down her back then her arms. She had been serious about washing Star, even though they didn't have soap or anything, she could at least ensure that they smelled entirely of the sea rather than sex. "Would you be interested in learning to fight, by the way?" A topic change, though this time it was done on Star's behalf. "I could rehabilitate my right arm while showing you some basics, if you would be interested."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star quieted when told there was nothing to explain. Well, if they were sure, she wouldn't risk telling them something that would expose emotion that she was not permitted to share. Being told that they were serious about her was soothing, something that had her smiling. She nodded, the trust swelling in her heart. She believed them, truly. She would not recover from a breach of that trust, but she truly didn't even worry about such a thing. She believed, without doubt, that Ella was being genuine, and that they were the sort of person who could never hurt her. It was, among many other reasons, why she loved Ella so. She felt safe with them. Wanted. Solely desired. And of course, Star returned that all in full. "And I'm serious about you, one-hundred and ten percent." She smiled. "Only you. Always, only ever you. I mean all the things I have said." The marriage, the desire to have children, all of it. She didn't push it, because she didn't want to bubble up pain in Ella's heart, but she'd keep reinforcing this notion of her singular desire for this woman and nobody else. The topic change was taken, though she giggled. "Do I really look like a fighter to you, my love?" she asked while basking in the feeling of water moving over her back. She didn't raise her hand all the way up to Ella's scars, but she did roll her hand up to their back as far as she could without touching them to wash it in turn. "I'd probably just hurt myself if I tried to use a blade. Though if you need someone to practice with, I will do my best straw dummy impersonation for you, just don't actually hit me of course, as I'm still very squishy, ehehe.~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra began moving her light rubbing to Star's sides, careful to put enough pressure that her motions wouldn't be ticklish, while smiling at what Star said. "Do you look like a fighter? no. Does that mean you might not ever have to do so, or want to become one? Also no." She took a moment to pull her head back and give Star a dubious stare. "If it weren't for my armor and that I HAVE trained myself to be one, do I look like a fighter? Short as I am? When most people think of a royal guard, they'd think of some six foot tall burly guy. At best, I look like a duelist, and that's only when I'm actually carrying my weapon." Which her eyes flicked to to ensure it was still there and nothing and no one had come up to steal their clothes yet. "Because rapier's are typically a duelist type weapon." And then she shook her head. "And I'm not going to practice with you if you're not interested in learning. Too much risk for you, especially if I'm using my right hand and getting used to the movements again. I'll ask Amara, and maybe Amelia occasionally if she'll sling a few low energy spells at me for me to catch with my right hand." She leaned in to give a smooch to Star's forehead, just as she began moving to running her hands out along Star's stomach and up, circling the edge of her breasts without actually moving to touch or grope them.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

If these two were in the trance state in this moment, there was a solid chance that Star's head would have little hearts floating off it from how Ella was touching her. The love that flowed off her, the genuine and pure happiness, it was all obvious that this, right here, was a very happy moment for Star. Being touched, being able to press bodies close together, just having time together as lovers...It wasn't as intense as sex, nor did it foster the more intimate sides of their love, but it was comforting, it was soothing, it was beautiful and only served to make her love flow out of her heart for Ella to feel. She wouldn't stop them from more lurid groping; being beautiful and wanted by Ella certainly meant that any alone time they had was free range for Ella to worship her however they desired. But for the time being, she could only look into Ella's eyes with her love blooming all around her aura for them to see. She didn't have to say it, but it was all there. Though still young and lacking the maturity, it was another reminder that Star's love now was the same love that she held in her heart in that distant future prediction. It was real. That future was real. All the necessary things to make it real already existed. Star of course reciprocated the gentle touching all over her lover. Ella's careful scans on the treeline didn't reveal any threats or dangers. But while they were distracted by that, Star leaned in to kiss their cheek with a giggle. "I could use some practice in defending myself at close range. I have some ability to debilitate would-be attackers, and of course defend myself with my aura, but even something as simple as a thunderwave can be difficult for me. From what I understand, the chroamtic auramancy arts are more attuned to combat in a lot of cases, but somehow I doubt you'll want to practice fighting against me to help me refine my timing with my chromatic aura. Though if you wanted to come at me with a particularly threatening stick instead of your rapier it might be more agreeable," she said with another giggle. "If for no other reason than to assure yourself that I've gotten quite adept at protecting myself in emergencies." Her features softened a little, keeping a smile while she rubbed up along Ella's side, mindful to not touch any scars on their back or the one on their ribs while she did so. "It's inevitable that I'll end up in danger sometimes. Battlefields are chaos, I'm sure you'll agree. And through no fault of anyone, I'm gonna need to protect myself sometimes. And I want you to be able to feel comfortable knowing I will be okay, that I can protect myself for at least a short time, long enough for you to get to me and protect me. Not just so that big heart of yours can rest easy," she said, moving her hand to gently lay her palm over Ella's heart. "But also because it's important for me that you keep safe, too. And we'll both stay safest if we keep cool heads and don't do reckless things as much as possible, right?" Another smile. "And for what it's worth, I already told you what you look like to me. But if you wanted to try a new look, with your permission there's something I've been wanting to try..." A little curiosity in those eyes showed itself. Obviously asking for consent, as always, but something about this request seemed like Star might have a little mischief in mind.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella had considered touching Star in more lewd ways here, but she'd held back. Considering what they had just done and were currently washing up for, as much as there was desire in her now to push for more and bring Star to even more orgasms, she didn't want to overwhelm her with that. Or to let herself turn to sex as a way to distract from the feelings and the intimacy, which she was afraid she might end up doing. She was challenging herself to actually spent quality time with Star, not just rut like rabbits like she would any other woman she picked up in a tavern. So, as she touched, it was all gentle. Washing, not focusing on any points that gave Star pleasure or would intentionally arouse her. Oh, being naked and pressed close, touching one another, was going to be arousing no matter what - but that wasn't the focus or goal of it, at least. As Star spoke, she tilted her head. "I like the idea of testing and helping you with your magic to defend yourself. Would also give me practice at being able to redirect it, or learning what bits of your auramancy magic I can't touch that way." She shrugged, then continued. "As for my looks, are you trying to tell me you would like to change the way I look? Don't think I'm attractive huh?" Ella skipped over the reconfirmation they were going to both stay safe. She had agreed to not doing reckless shit previously, but that had been on her own. If it came down to her doing reckless shit or Star dying, Ella was going to recklessly do whatever she had to do to keep Star safe. She distracted from her avoidance of this comment with her tease though, smiling. "I see. Well fine, try what you've been wanting to try. See if you can give me the perfect ideal image of a partner you have in your mind." She huffed mockingly, looking up and away and standing still for Star to practice her auramancy shifting on her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star donned a warm grin as Ella teased her. "On the contrary, you're already my perfect woman, so if I don't so something to distract myself about that we're just gonna end up having so much sex that we'll never get anything done. It's a real problem," she said with a giggle. True as it was that sex being very tempting and distracting was very much a thing, she was just leaning into the playfulness. She did lean up to take Ella's earlobe between her teeth with them looking up and away, which exposed their weak spot. She didn't linger there, but simply could not resist the chance. Once she retreated, she took a moment to focus. Her aura reached out and resonated with Ella's, mingling together and flowing her mana through Ella in that way that had come to be able to bypass Ella's natural resistances so effectively. The result of what Star was doing? Ella would feel a bit...Strange inside. A feeling that didn't feel quite normal. A mild quiver and strangeness flowing through the muscles as it traveled from their core both up and down. If Ella kept her eyes open during this, they would find their vision slowly getting...Sharper? Things became clearer at a distance than they had been before, and more subtle movements in the treeline that had previously been invisible now registered in Ella's mind as movement. Things that were just woodland critters, they would see upon watching. Then, for a split second, the world went entirely silent, then the soft sounds of rolling waves on the shore and blowing trees became more crisp and defined as Ella felt tingling on the side of their head, then again on top of their head. Their ears had moved up on top of their head, and felt different than before, which at that point might reveal what Star had done. But with just enough time to realize what was happening, the feeling of a tail appearing on their backside then followed. Star had done to Ella what she had done to herself a few times and given them fox features reminiscent of the people of Neet, though these features were entirely Ella's own, with natural silver fur to match their hair. And looking back at Star, Ella would see that she had the same features. Done as a symbol of solidarity, rather than needing to to accomplish this. She looked at Ella with her now vertical-pupil vulpine eyes that were mirrored back in Ella. She smiled, and her fox ears flicked atop her head. "Ehe.~ Well. Looks like that works as I thought it would. And now that we're alone you can rub them all you want. And don't worry! I can turn us back any time."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella rolled her eyes at Star's answer to the tease, but sucked in a breath when Star leaned in to take her earlobe in her teeth. A sharp spike of arousal shot through her, the sensation causing a shiver to go down Ella, and then for the aura to begin working on her pushed that arousal down to be replaced with unease. The feeling building in her stomach as things began to change was not a pleasant one to Ella, but she didn't pull away from Star. She trusted her, and just braced herself for whatever was happening. The change in sight was impressive, actually. She immediately tensed as she began to see movement in the tree line, but relaxed when she realized it was just her increased eyesight allowing her to see woodland creatures. And then she felt the sound around her disappear, only to come back a bit louder for the same exact sounds. A glance around was given, before turning to look at Star who apparently had undertaken the same changes. The feeling of a tail was odd, though seeing Star's ears made her smile and that tail to swish happily, naturally. "It took a lot not to do this yesterday." And she reached up, being gentle when running fingers along Star's new ears from top to bottom, and then gently massage and scratch behind them. She was careful and gentle with her touch wanting to ensure if they were particularly sensitive she didn't hurt Star at all, but the desire to rub and scratch at them was no longer being held back. She even pulled Star's head down so that she could give a smooch right to the top of her head, between the ears, and then pulled away with a smile at Star. "Adorable." And she meant it. There was just something about people with ears like this that Ella found cute, though she would NEVER tell Amara or Amelia that.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's tail swished under the water just the same, not able to feature quite as prominently for either of them given it was submerged and would be all wet if they stepped out like they were, instead of adorably poofy. She leaned into the touches and scratches when they came, with the happiness and delight at the sensations rolling through her aura for Ella to feel. It would make it quite easy to know just what spots were best, thanks to the auramancy that connected them, so Star was putty under it in moments. Of course, she wasn't going to just let it all be one-sided, and so she reached up, going under Ella's arms, to scratch gently at the base of either of Ella's vulpine ears in turn to let them feel it firsthand as well. "Yes, you are," she said with a pleased smile. "As much as this is mostly for fun, I swear it was also for tactical value as well. I can take this enhanced sight and hearing and meld it into the magic that I use to support you, with or without the cute fluffy details. Being able to scratch your fox ears is just a little present for me, of course," she said, then leaned up to kiss Ella on the lips. Something that would draw a bit of attention to the mouth, where Ella would feel the different posture of their jaw which did feel natural when their jaw was still, but talking and kissing gave them a small reminder that their canines were elongated to carnivore fangs, with their jaw adjusting to ensure they weren't just stabbing their own gums with them. The kiss was short, but full of love. "I hope you also know that if you don't drag me out of this water, I'm going to stand here with you all day and night. Being able to be nude and flush against you feels way too nice to voluntarily give up."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra enjoyed the feeling of pleasure coming from Star at the scritches, smiling, and then when Star reached up to return the favor she froze. It felt good, and she closed her eyes for a moment, before allowing her head to tilt into Star's touch and nuzzle. She breathed in deep, before opening her eyes and looking around again, taking in how nice having these were, just before she was kissed. The kissing was...odd, with the different jaw shape. She blinked in surprise when she felt how different and weird the sensation was, and as the kiss ended she was running her tongue along one of the canines, then moved one hand up to gently run across them. "This is neat. I didn't realize it changed so much." Ella took a moment to enjoy the new sensations that came with these additional senses, thinking about the potential of using them for hunting or even just travelling at night. Then she thought of how much more sensitive her hearing was, and how much Amelia and Amara might have heard of them without saying anything. There were times in Myst where Ella had whispered to Star that surely the two had heard either way. The thought caused her to frown for a moment, but she shook her head and returned her attention to Star, smiling to her. Her hands slid around to Star's back and she brought her in close, pressing nude body to nude body, and leaned in to kiss where her shoulder met her neck. "I don't think we're in a hurry. We've got three days to kill after all." She slid her hands down Star's back, to her rear and gently let her fingers dig into Star's fleshy exterior. A soft squeeze, not sexual per say but more just enjoying the freedom to touch Star like this - and a lowkey experiment to see where Star enjoyed being touched. "This transformation doesn't drain you, does it? If it's taxing, best to stop for now though, especially if we're going to be training later."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was delighted to feel Ella's acceptance at their shared closeness. The chance to be just...Lovers, for a moment. There was a great deal of happiness that Ella was sure to feel from Star at that. The adjustment to all the new senses came with time, and the last of them was the heightened sense of smell. The water did a lot to dull the scents that Ella might smell, but the obvious one was Star. Her breezy, misty, floral scent that was oh so very delicately feminine was about the only major scent aside from the lingering scent of the ocean for Ella to smell. Star craned her neck when Ella kissed at her neck, loosing a breathy sigh of pleasure at that. The hands over her rear evoked a small delight as well. Not a particularly sensitive spot, but Ella touching her in that hungry, possessive way was nice. It was more the intent than the actual touch that did something for Star in that case, and of course with that came some swishing of her tail, which lightly bat against Ella's hands or forearms as they groped her. Star then shook her head to the question. "Mmn, no...Most auramancy is very natural for me. I'd have to evoke these sorts of changes in one or both of us for hours before I got tired. I don't know if it would ever have any purpose in battle, but if you think of any strategies that involve you turning into a sexy fox lady, lemme know, okay?~" she asked with a giggle, and while doing so let her hands trail down to the base of Ella's new tail so she could circle a finger around the base of it gently. The underwater aspect of it was sure to dull the sensation a bit but she was curious if Ella's tail was sensitive. A learning experience for both of them, surely.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella had almost forgotten about the tail. When she felt it moving around, her fingers moved up to trace a spat just at the base around the tail, then run her fingers along it before back. At the confirmation this type of change wouldn't really tax Star much, Ella had relaxed about them having it, closing her eyes and enjoying the sensation of Star touching her in return. For her, the circling of a finger around the base of her tail tickled and felt odd, obviously not being used to that sensation. Was it something some people found arousing? She was curious, but obviously wasn't going to ask Amelia or Amara. Instead, she straightened and kissed Star's cheek, before pulling back just enough to look her in the eyes. She kept their bodies pressed together with her hands resting on Star's hips, but didn't do anything to massage or touch anywhere. "I can think of a few reasons to give me these, actually. First, better eyesight. If we're fighting or travelling in the dark, that could help a lot. Along with better ears as well, and a better smell if we're tracking something. If our enemy is invisible, this could also be beneficial, though I'm not sure how well it would work. It would be a bit better than natural senses, but I'm not sure if it would be better enough to make a huge difference." She paused, then gave Star a salacious smile. "And also, if we were to be like this during sexy, just think of how good smelling and tasting you would be." There was a glint in her eyes, a desire to try this, even if she wasn't going for that right now. She was doing her best to respect Star for a partner, not just be sex machines, which is why her hands hadn't drifted anywhere near her inner thighs or anywhere that would cause her arousal to be hard to resist.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star responded a bit more intensely than Ella at the base of her tail being touched. The question of 'is it arousing for some people' would be certainly answered as Star shivered, her back straightened, and she gave a shuddering gasp as toes curled into the sand on the shore floor below. "E-Eeee~!" she squealed, her hips pushing against Ella to try and pull away from the sensation only because it was so sensitive. She then buried her face against Ella's neck in embarrassment. When she had a moment to calm down, she pulled back and, with a bright red face, addressed the other comments. "L-Like I said, uhm...I can provide those benefits without necessarily the fluffy parts, naturally having enhanced senses will be useful for a lot of things. I-I mean, specific things like having a tail, or some other trait like that." She then paused a moment upon receiving the salacious smile and alluring glint. The submissiveness in her bubbled up, bringing forth the desire to move over to shore and bend over for Ella. Sure, their relationship was about way more than sex, but the physical aspects of their love were important as well. That all said, they were just coming down from having sex, so the respect was appreciated. Much as Star really would just roll around with Ella on the beach all day and make a mess of them both, she didn't want to go at it so much that it felt rushed, or that the novelty and exploration of one another was rushed. There was time to savour one another, to tease one another, and she enjoyed that. So while Ella's words did definitely get a rise out of Star, making her flush more fully red and bite her lower lip, she resisted the urge to lay her cute vulpine body down on the beach for Ella and beg for more. It was definitely a real and present urge, all the same. "I-If we're talking about sexy times, there's lots of room for experimenting, if you ever did want to, I'm sure. Now that I know I can do this, and all, there's probably all kinds of things I haven't thought of that we could play around with to mix things up." Words said with another bite of her lower lip, though Star's innocent mind was a bit too innocent to come to certain natural conclusions that came along with this power.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Oh, she ENJOYED Star's response to the rubbing at the base of Star's tail. Her eyes glinted devlishly and she had to resist doing it again immediately afterwards. If she had her way, she'd just do it constantly until Star was all but begging for more than that touch. The desire rose in her chest and she had to breathe through the almost lust filled haze, the way her own body had reacted so strongly to Star's response. Finally, she swallowed, even as she watched Star's flush deepen at her words, and she couldn't help but lean in. Normally, she'd go to lightly kiss her earlobe before whispering, but since Star no longer had earlobes, she pulled Star's head down so she could pull the tip of Star's new ear into her mouth. She didn't use teeth, just closing her lips around it and letting her tongue flick the corner, before leaning in to whisper. "Think you could make my tongue longer? For..." She said, ensuring her voice was as husky as she could make it. "Deep licking?" Okay, she had to stop the flirting though or she wouldn't be able to, so after saying that she did release Star and take a step back. Her heart was pounding in her chest and her desire for Star was strong - Star wouldn't need her auramancy to see the way Ella eyed Star up and down like she were a treat to be savored - but she was still restraining it for now. For now being the clarifying and vital addendum.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't know Ella's intentions, but could feel the way they enjoyed her response enough to put together that she was inviting them to torture and tease her about this sensitivity. Of course, the sensation was arousing, but perhaps a bit overly so, requiring a very delicate touch to avoid being overstimulating. She had a few shaky breaths to calm down from that, though she couldn't deny how there was this magnetism between them that, even in the wake of calming down her lusts, they were just getting stoked again, for as much as Ella wanted Star, she reciprocated all of those desires, to the point that they could very much end up getting nothing done if they gave into it all. The question evoked another shudder. "U-Uhm," she began, her face heating up more. "M-Maybe..? I d-don't know, it's easiest to mimic things I've already felt before from someone else. I've not yet tried to...Make something up. Though I suppose I did feel the aura of that dragon once.." she said, trailing off in thought. A long dragon's tongue might fulfil the requirements. Being released and separated evoked a small protest from her aura. No, don't leave! More snuggles, it demanded. It was for the best, of course. The danger of giving into the horny was real. She did seem to be lost in thought on this subject for a moment, considering the possibilities more thoroughly. Until at some point her face just went...Entirely red. Arousal and embarrassment filled her aura as she seemingly stumbled on what might be a very lewd or enjoyable thought. Enough that she clammed up and just kind of stood there for a moment for Ella to observe. If they were in their trance, Star might very well melt have melted into a puddle of her own embarrassment.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella would keep the potential of how stimulating that touch was in her mind. She certainly didn't want to overstimulate Star, and yet doing it if she did it right would be a great boon. The idea of Star needing to have 'felt' something before made her frown, wondering how she would have felt a long tongue against her before, when she realized at Star's addendum about a dragon that she'd meant their aura, not actually feeling someone licking her with a long tongue. The small bit of jealousy that had risen at that dissipated, replaced by curiosity as she felt star get more and more aroused and embarrassed. She had just dipped her head under water, to both cool her own head down and also wash her hair while she was here - might as well - but as she came up and saw the redness coating all of Star's face she smiled. "Oh love, you HAVE to tell me whatever it is you just thought of." She tried to guess it in her own mind before hand. Had Star imagined what Ella would have done with that tongue? Or some other parts that might cause increased arousal? Perhaps adding a dick on her, or two? Ella was a little hesitant about those ideas, but down for it. Still, those were her guesses as to what might have caused Star to blush so hard, considering the baby fever she'd had so far today. Ella wanted to walk closer and kiss Star's blushing face, but she was truly worried that if she approached close to Star again right now, with how aroused they both were, they'd just end up doing some very lewd things here in the water or on the beach. And sand getting into places where the sun didn't shine did not sound like a very fun idea, all around.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wasn't sure where the jealousy was coming from in Ella, but with most emotions, particularly the smaller, less intense ones, she always tried to wait and see if they just went away on their own instead of jumping at them. Seeing it fizzle out had a bit of curiosity come with it, but she was too occupied on her own thoughts to think about that heavily, and it was dismissed. Being pressed on what she thought about, Star recoiled a little. "N-Na?!" came what was probably a word at some point between brain and mouth, but got lost along the way. Her embarrassment grew twice over at being acknowledged, and a shot of adrenaline and arousal went through her. "O-Oh, uhm..." She paused, considering if it was okay to talk about. But in typical Star fashion, honesty won out. She visibly shrunk a little and pushed her index fingers together in front of her. "N-Nothing crazy, really...J-Just, uhm...Suppose I put together one way that we might bring little Luna into this world, is all." And naturally that had led to her thinking about Ella ramming their dick into her and pouring their seed into her, which...Was very counterproductive to her need to stop being a horny gremlin for five minutes and be responsible about this whole thing. So, taking Ella's lead, she plugged her nose and sunk her head under the water a moment to try and shock herself back to being cooled off.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella smiled wide at one of her guesses coming true, though there was also confusion with it. Could she actually get Star pregnant that way? She'd assumed there was just some magic, or someone who looked similar to her had gotten Star pregnant on her behalf - some form of proxy type situation - but that Star could actually give her a functioning penis caused her to pause. She warred between teasing and pushing Star into more embarrassment, to seeing how red she could get Star's face, and the actual concern with the idea. As much as Ella wanted a child - and every part of her did, even if she would hate herself and claim she'd never be a good parent - the idea of having one right now was trouble. Obviously, starting their family now wouldn't be a good idea, and she was a little concerned Star might be tempted if Ella pushed too hard on flirting with that. So, instead, Ella gave Star her space to duck under the water and wet her hair, to cool off her arousal. by the time Star would come back up, Ella had flopped back into the water, letting herself float atop it, staring up at the sky with these newly sensitive eyes. Her tail wagged a little in the water beneath her, causing her to spin slowly while floating, and her newfound ears twitched whenever her head dipped back enough for water to get in them. "Are you a firm follower of the gods, Star?" That was one hell of a topic change, but the idea of the topic had been in the back of her mind for a while, and Star surely needed a distraction right now anyways. A distraction from the idea of rutting eachother until Star was full of seed and ready to start a family already.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

When Star rose back up and saw Ella just naked and floating on the water, she couldn't help but giggle a bit. Not only because she had to resist the urge to stand by Ella's feet and just unashamedly stare between their legs like a horny gremlin, but also because she could see their tail flicking around like a little rudder under them. Instead of being a horny gremlin, she moved up behind Ella and gently sunk down then pushed up again to secure Ella's head to rest on her shoulder while she gently laid her hands over top of them, folded over their abdomen, in a romantic little hug that could only ever function in the water. The question evoked some pause for thought, not only for its own merits but also for the jarring change in subject. "Hmm...Not really," she said after some consideration. "Obviously I acknowledge they exist, but I don't much care for what feels like the political tug of war that they play. I just care about people, you know? I want everyone I meet to be smiling and living a happy life. We all have our struggles, but...I'd hope to spare people tragedy wherever I go. I'm sure there are some gods out there who feel the same and approve of what I do, but it's not really important to me whether or not that's true. My mom always encouraged me to just be myself, as much as I possibly could. And that somewhere along the way in my life, that'd earn me the romantic gaze of a gorgeous knight lady who makes me weak in the knees." She kissed Ella's cheek, here. "Definitely had that exact prophecy and I'm not just making that up to flatter you. Totally.~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella hadn't expected Star to come up under them like that. She almost jerked away at the touch, as if expecting it was a fish or something that had come up to touch or grab at her. As soon as she realized it was Star, she relaxed back into it and let her head rest on Star's shoulder, lightly kicking her feet to ensure her lower half stayed up with Star's hands moving to wrap around her abdomen. She took a deep breath and just relaxed into the gentle hold, turning her head enough to lay a quick kiss to Star's neck or jawbone, whatever she could reach without disrupting the position much, before turning her eyes back up to the day sky. "The reason I ask is, if it weren't for how Valentina does what she's doing, the methods to her goal, I might have been willing to join her. And seeing how she's doing it, the fact that she's taken your mother, and all...I wonder if I'm not just as bad as her, sometimes." There was no self hate, no deprecations - this wasn't the normal type of bad self-talk that Star might be used to from Ella. No, there was...pity, for Valentina. "Considering how much she suffers, and that she blames the gods for that, their inability or unwillingness to remove the curse on her, that they are probably the ones who created it...I might have gotten to the point of taking up arms against their 'political tug of war', as you called it, too. I'd like to think I wouldn't do it the same way, but after suffering for a millennia, I don't know I could guarantee that." She nuzzled her new ears up against Star, just to see how it felt, while talking. "I trust if I ever started going that far though, you'd knock me over the head and tell me to stop though, wouldn't you?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The ears nuzzling up against Star certainly would feel nice, as all sweet attention to those fuzzy triangles would be. Star listened to the words, thoughtful. She didn't judge any of the words without due consideration, as it was clearly a difficult and important topic. She accepted the kiss on her jaw, then turned to nuzzle Ella's cheek in turn. Nuzzling, while in this fox-state, felt very natural to do for her. It evoked a stronger bonding feeling than usual for her. She was quiet for a time as she thought on all that was said, but smiled at least to the closing thought. "I'd never let you go that far, no. But it just makes me wonder if there's some part of it we're missing. Is it really just so simple that that suffering warped her like that? You'd know better I suppose, having actually spoken to her." She paused here, just enjoying the water and the closeness. She could feel the pity, and she sympathized. "I can't even begin to imagine what it's like. But since you said if I saw her, or even sensed her, that I would apparently go insane, well...I can get an idea of the depths of it. It's...I wouldn't say hard, but my auramancy making me so empathetic does mean of course that I share in the pain of those around me. If I was still a young girl when I met you, as you were when I met you, I probably would have broken into tears from feeling that guilt on your shoulders. Goodness knows I've cried a lot about it anyway in the times we've spoken about those harder topics." She squeezed her lover a little, here. "But to me, that's just a reminder that I'm still alive. That I'm human. That I still feel. And it's certainly possible that those parts of her, those parts that are supposed to guide us all away from the darkness, have gone numb from what she's been exposed to. Just like I'd feel for anyone else I'd...Be angry at the gods, too, for not helping, if they could. I try not to think too much about it because I'm just some mortal...If I'm to maintain any understanding of the gods being good, I have to believe there's an equal reason why they don't save every person in tragedy." She wasn't saying it out loud but, she certainly let her thoughts drift to Magnolia. How would that have ended, if an angel stepped in to stop Magnolia's death? Did their absence mean they assented to the death? Was it a lack of resources, of willingness, or something else? Again, she forced herself not to think about it too much, though the sadness in her heart had already appeared for Ella to feel. "It doesn't make a lot of sense to me that she'd tell you about what would happen to me if she came around. That she'd agree to call off what Amelia called her 'goon squad' against us. That she's clearly so powerful but...Doesn't exercise her capacity to just kill us with a flick of her wrist. There's a lot I don't understand about her but...It makes me wonder what kind of person she was like before the curse."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She took a deep breath, closing her eyes when she felt Star nuzzle right back. She lowered her body back into the water, pressing her feet to the sandy grown beneath, and then pushed her back up against Star. her hands came down to lightly hold onto Star's around her abdomen, that tail brushing and rubbing against Star's own stomach and, well, a little lower but it wasn't doing so intentionally or with lustful intentions. It was just a factor of them standing together like that. "Do you remember, when I reached into that magical armor and then just went fell to a knee, after? I don't know if you saw all the emotions I felt when that happened, Star, but I felt suffering. I saw people getting beaten, killed, as if I were them. I cried afterwards because just what was probably thirty seconds in our world, felt like days of torture in those memories." She shook her head, her heart tightening and the emotions from those 'memories', or visions, coming back to her. "That's when I pulled the curse into myself, unknowingly. And just a bit of it, not the full extent. If that's what she experiences every moment of every day, with the full power of the curse, feeling everyone's suffering in this world? I would go a little crazy too. Without the ability to end it." She squeezed Star's hands, because as much as they'd agreed no death, Ella wasn't sure she'd have been able to maintain that suffering and not attempt just like she'd seen Valentina do so. "When she removed the curse, I saw some of her past. When she got it. She might not have been the best person in the world, but she was certainly not like she is now. She loved. She helped others. She spent years trying to figure out how to break the curse she now has just to save the person she loved. If you were cursed as such, I would do the exact same thing, Star." She turned to look at Star, seriousness in her eyes. Turning in the embrace to be front to front again. "There are so many similarities between her and I. She was a curse breaker, I can draw a curse into myself and then dismiss it's magic. I'm not exactly a curse breaker by title, but the possibility is there. She fell in love, and then spent years trying to figure out a way to save that person. And when she tried, she became cursed herself. And then the person she loved married someone else, and she was there for that, supporting her through it." Ella leaned in, pressing her forehead to Star's. "It's easy to just say she's a horrible person because of things she lets happen, like what was happening in Cloverport or how she was prepared to have the entire village of Neet murdered in their sleep. But knowing what I know of her past, it...makes me wonder if I wouldn't have turned out the same, or even worse, in her situation. I already hate the gods for my own reasons. Would I not be willing to do terrible things, after all of that if it happened to me, to get back at them too?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star moved with her lover to keep the embrace on them, happy they were back to holding onto each other like this. The natural pull of her body to theirs so that comfort could be maintained was a strong one. It had a natural aspect of arousal to it, but she wasn't going to get turned on just from the contact, doubly when the mood was anything but arousing. The comfort, however. There was lots of that. She loved the comfort, and hoped to give mutual comfort to her lover. She kept her forehead on theirs, supporting them as she held them close. She frowned at the recollection of the memory of when Ella had fallen to the ground in tears over what had happened to them with the magic armor. She remembered. She remembered it well. "I saw it. I felt it. It was a lot. I...Was more focused on you in the moment. The prospect of you or Amara dying sort of put all that awfulness on the backburner but...I definitely saw it," she confirmed, not enjoying the memory but...Accepting it, letting it live in her heart, as she did all things. She thought carefully about the admittance that Ella would go crazy and possibly murderous when inundated with that suffering. She could cast no judgement. Trauma broke people. It was so exceedingly rare for a person to be evil just because some sort of evil desire filled them. It was far more likely that anyone doing awful things was doing so because of suffering in their heart. Being told that Ella would do the same thing for her evoked a small blush. She liked the idea that Ella would work so tirelessly for her. A small affirmation of love. But she also just hated the idea of putting Ella through that. More than the thought of suffering herself, there was a strange loop of logic where it was more motivating for her to not get hurt or cursed specifically because she didn't want the truth of her being hurt to hurt Ella, rather than just the natural self-preservation of not wanting to get hurt because getting hurt was...bad. She nodded to the notions that Valentina once loved and helped others, which curiously just brought more sorrow up in Star's heart. Star considered her next words for a few moments, basking in the sensation of their foreheads together and tips of their ears touching. "Do you think it is vengeance that drives her? It feels...A little too calculated for that, to me. If it was just a matter of doing horrible things for the sake of snubbing the gods...Why did she take my mother hostage? Why not just kill her, and me, and you? And when all of the people of Neet were set to die, why not just kill them herself? I suppose you mentioned Sapphire was there but...Even as far back as Cloverport, I couldn't help but notice how the pirates just sort of...Lived and let live. Sure, some people looked a bit afraid of them, I was certainly wary myself, and you saw how they threatened me. But with how many there were, it's a wonder that it didn't devolve into chaos. And more than that, aside from the few dead warriors of the elven settlement...I can't recall seeing any civilian bodies among the dead after the fight. It was...Too clean, if the goal was chaotic vengeance. Maybe I'm just reading too much into things, but...That has kinda bothered me for a while. I thought we just got lucky. And maybe that's true but...What do you think? I'm sure you've seen some chaotic battlefields before, right?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella considered this, thinking seriously about the potential of what Star was saying. That the pirates weren't actively killing people, and that vengeance might not be what drove her to do what she did. She shook her head. "No idea." Pulling her head up enough to lean in and press her lips against Star's gently, she smiled into the brief touch of lips before pulling away again, floating back away from Star's hold once more. Though this time, she had a playful look on her face. She had successfully distracted Star from the burgeoning arousal and desire, but she also didn't want the conversation to go down into mood killing, pointless speculation. So she kicked her feet lightly as she began to swim backwards away from Star, intentionally kicking in a way that caused some water to splash up onto Star. "You know what these new forms would be great for? Guard and Bandit." The game where one person, named the guard, had their eyes closed and had to walk around in water to try to find the bandit, who made noise while moving and occasionally said 'give me all your gold!' in response to the guard saying 'who is there?!' With their improved hearing, it would make it quite difficult for the bandit, and she was trying to drag Star into a game. They had time, and going into a game would be something other than fucking they could do together.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft sigh when the end result was a resounding 'no idea'. Yeah, her either. It didn't make sense, and that bothered her, but what could she do about it? Get splashed in the face by Ella kicking water at her, apparently, was the answer. She rose her hands up to cover herself and giggled. Hearing that Ella wanted to play a game, she had a small flicker of excitement, but upon hearing what game they wanted to play, she snickered. "Ella. Darling, could you tell me how we're supposed to play that game when we both can cheat? While I think you might still have to focus on that feeling a bit to get it to work, I know at least I always know where you are around me if we're close enough. Certainly outranges normal conversational volumes. I don't particularly have an off switch for mine, much as I wish I could just ask you to trust me," she said with a giggle. The door was open for Ella to maybe be the guard in this game, but one could only imagine the kind of playground shunning Star would have gotten for her cheating magical powers at the very serious game of Guard and Bandit.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella stopped swimming backwards and paused, straightening up at the realization of this being a very unfair game with an auramancer. Even if she were the guard, she knew that she could find Star if she wanted to, if Star were nearby. Perhaps it would be good practice? She considered this, but shook her head and instead moved back up to Star again, instead just lightly splashing at her shoulder. "Well I hadn't considered that, but you make a good point. Can't say I know very many other...wholesome...water games. Do you?" Her mind went to the competitions to see who could hold her breath the longest while performing certain oral activities under the water. She'd only played it with the one partner, but at the idea of water games it had jumped to mind either way. In reality, there was the option of just heading back to camp, but they didn't get a whole lot of time alone while travelling with Amelia and Amara. Oh sure those two seemed to understand wanting to give them time together, but Ella knew that was them going out of their way to do so. Might as well take advantage of this time while they had it, because who knew how much more of it they would have on the rest of their journey.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave her lover a slightly knowing look. "I feel like the pause around the word 'wholesome' means there's at least one or two that involve adult things," she said with a giggle and a mild bit of arousal. She didn't let that consume her of course. But there was truth that it was one thing to resist one's own arousal when one was able to say to themselves it was just one-sided, it was another matter entirely when each party could see and feel the arousal of the other as it happened, opening so many chances for two people who were in love to just get caught in a cycle of arousal with each other. Still. She tried. "Uhm. I can't say I know too many games in general, if I'm honest. I was never a very active little girl. A lot of time was spent in meditation and doing little crafts with the other kids in Snowhaven when I was young. But painting and music don't really happen in the water, nor are they really games." She paused, remembering something Ella said. "...And I mean REAL music, not...You know.." Another blush, and some arousal again. Damn it. "We already made enough music here to wake the region, I'm sure." A little smile and bite of her lower lip. She was trying to be fussy about it, but the honest truth was she had so much love and desire for Ella that she couldn't even be pretend fussy about it. "I have a ball we can throw around but..." she moved through the water to move closer to Ella. "We don't have to force it, you know? I'm just as delighted to lay on the beach naked with you and cuddle. I have a bikini if you wanted a mini fashion show, but I don't think that's really all that wholesome."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra smiled at the knowing look. Star had fully guessed it, and she just winked to her lover at that. And then the comment about making music together made her smile wider, remembering the 'music' they had made earlier. "I will never get tired of hearing that music from you, Star. But perhaps you're right." Her eyes turned to look at the sand, then back to Star who had moved closer to her. She stepped forward and brought heir nude forms together for a quick hug before shaking her head at Star. "Love, one thing you should know about me is I hate sand getting in places that it should not get in. Sand is great for building sand castles and burying one another and just being silly in, but naked activities on sand have never ended positively for me." There was a moment where the thought of 'deities, she must think I'm a whore' passed through Ella's mind. In reality, she was much more experienced than Star, but she didn't actually sleep with a lot of different people. Enough that she could count on one hand, she just happened to sleep with them multiple times. Still, and even if she had slept with a lot of people, she knew that wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but there was a moment of uncertainty and insecurity about whether or not that would bother Star. She thought back to the jealousy she'd felt from Star before, and then dropped her voice a bit. "I'm sorry, if me saying things like that or my past experience bothers you, Star. I won't bring it up if it does." It was said to try to be soothing, gentle, in case the consistent reminder of experience differential bothered her lover, or made her doubt Ella's faithfulness to her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star snickered. "I wasn't thinking of doing anything that would get sand in places they don't belong. I was thinking of laying out a towel and cuddling, darling," she said, accepting her lover's embrace. "But cuddling up here with you like this in the water is fine, too," she confirmed, not really fixated on the beach idea so much as she was just wanting to be close to her lover as much as possible. When the subject shifted to Ella's uncertainty about past experience, she looked a little curious for a moment, then just smiled as she put together what might be going through Ella's mind. How they might be insecure about how that might affect their relationship. To answer? She gently kissed them on the lips, still not perfectly used to the new teeth in her jaw, but not bothered by it. "Ella. There's nothing about it that could bother me. I trust you. And even if Sophia herself was to walk out of the forest and try to put the moves on you, well...Putting aside all the...Everything...About that and just focusing on the relationship part...I'd trust you to be honest about your feelings. And I believe you when you say those feelings are all for me. The way I see it is...Those people in your past, whether it was romantic attachment or not...They took care of my darling before I met you," she said, moving a hand to cup Ella's cheek. "They made you happy, didn't they? At least, at the time. I could never be upset about your past happiness, love. It hurts me how little happiness you have, now. Even if it's just watching you suppress your own excitement about something," she said, gentle and sweet and affectionate as ever as she stroked their cheek with her thumb. "It's true that I don't want you to want anyone else but me. I can admit that honestly. It would...Hurt beyond words if you told me you wanted someone more than me." Her lips wobbled at that thought, and some genuine fear rose in her heart, but it was smothered by her trust for her lover. "But I don't believe that you do. So...All your past experiences before you met me are just past happiness that I'm happy to relive with you any time you want, okay? Because, hey...Maybe I'll even get a few ideas from it?" She smiled. "And if you want some balance, I can tell you about Nina and how lewd she was. Let's just say I've been the one in the other room with walls that were definitely too thin before, eheh...I know it's not quite the same, as I never accepted any of her advances but..." She gently shrugged. "Whatever will help you feel comfortable being open and honest, my love."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella nodded. She felt...reassured. Even if she wasn't reassured that a towel would keep the sand from getting between her legs, because experience showed that it wouldn't entirely. Oh it'd help, but it wouldn't be perfect. Either way, she smiled at the gentle kiss, and nodded as Star explained that she would be fine because it was her past happiness. The mention of Sophia did cause an ache in her heart, but it wasn't because of any long lost feelings for Sophia. No, that ache came from the concern over whether or not Sophia was okay, and the memory of everything that happened at that last bit. There was a thought in the back of her mind, unproven one way or another, that not only had she gotten Marigold killed, she'd probably gotten Sophia in a lot of trouble for helping her escape. Of course, Ella had no way of knowing if Sophia had gotten in trouble or not, or what that had looked like at all, but it didn't stop the back of her head from wondering. In addition, as she listened to the rest and the desire and love Star felt for her, she just felt...that overwhelming return of love. The way her heart beat faster at Star's gentleness, softness with her. How she could just, love Ella with no holds barred. How completely open and kind and just, GOOD Star was. She closed her eyes and pulled Star tighter into an embrace, foreheads pressed together. "I don't deserve you, Star." Unlike previous times she'd said this, where it had been self deprecation, this time it wasn't. This time, instead of putting herself down, the statement was made to lift Star up. To appreciate her, to acknowledge what an amazing person she was. Oh, Ella still fully believed she didn't actually deserve Star - that self hate was still there - but in this moment? She was just admiring Star for being who she was. Leaning in, she brushed lips briefly, but didn't engage in more of a kiss. Though she wanted to, she knew that would lead to more, and as Star had said they'd already played enough music for the whole of the sun plane.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ella might have held back in the kiss, but Star did not. Star did not in the last five minutes change from being the fully open and honest woman she was, and her heart still had immense desires for Ella. Still had so much she wanted to express to them. So when their lips met, she leaned into the kiss a little more. Their vulpine maws were still new with this action, but that was part of the excitement. To be able to mix in a little tongue and lightly brush it along the length of one of Ella's fangs before mingling gently with their tongue in turn. The arousal, the desire, the burning WANT for Ella was still there, still strong, and still demanded satisfaction. But after a brief indulgence, Star relented, and let the kiss break, biting her lower lip as she pulled back. She wanted more, that was obvious. Just because she said she had already shouted to the whole of the sun plane did not mean she didn't want to spend all day making love to her lover. Yet still, for the sake of taking things slow, for allowing them time to build their relationship emotionally as well as physically, she held back for the moment. Of course, all Ella would need to do is take it that one step further and they'd be right back to having sex. But before that chance might come, she at least had a few things to say: "That isn't even slightly true. But even if it was, which it isn't...It wouldn't matter," she said, forehead gently pressed to Ella's. "Because I want you. The rest doesn't matter. I want you, only you, always you. I've waited so long for my heart to sing with this love, and now that it does, I won't ever let anything take it away from me. I love you, Ella."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

As Star pressed the kiss in more, Ella groaned. This woman was killing her. She was trying to behave - she really was. She wasn't used to not acting on shared desire and arousal like this. Not acting on it when it was one sided was easy, not acting on it when you knew both parties felt it was not. As the kiss ended and Star kept saying sweet things to her, kept reassuring her that she was loved and that she was wanted - and not just because she was good in bed, but for who she was - Ella felt tears well again. These weren't bad tears, and they didn't actually fall, but just the idea of accepting such a pure and honest love from Star still felt overwhelming for her. Every time Star reassured her that this was real, that this wasn't just her playing a game or a short term thing, Ella's heart swelled. Did she entirely accept that this wouldn't go awry, that Star wouldn't leave her in the future? No. But was she beginning to truly accept that right now, in this moment, Star loved her? Fully and completely, without reservation? Yes. And that was overwhelming, in a good way. Like when she'd looked out over the flowers and seen Luna, the tears that made her eyes misty were ones of positive emotion. She turned her head to place her forehead against Star's shoulder and took in a long, deep breath. "These emotions are going to be the death of me, Star. I don't know that I like how much I'm feeling every day with you." It was so much more than she'd been feeling. It was going from being close to a stoic, numb zombie prior to meeting Star to having a lot of bad emotions and now a lot of good. Her hands squeezed at Star, before pulling away again and turning, clearing her throat. "So, um." She tried to distract from how overwhelmed she was. How much her own love sang in return to the feeling of Star's, because if she focused on it she didn't know how she wouldn't just break down and cry in joy. And if she did that every time she felt love for Star, she'd just be a crying mess. She HATED crying, and she'd done more of it in the past couple of weeks with Star than she had essentially the rest of her life. There was a brief thought about how Sia would tell her to get back up and learn from it, to wipe the dirt and blood off and continue fighting, but how do you learn from positive emotions overwhelming you? She didn't know. She began walking towards the shore, slow enough that Star could easily come up to her and walk with her if she wanted. This wasn't her running from Star, but just needing a second. "Lets try this cuddling on the beach thing and share an apple before we get dressed and head back to camp, eh?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

When Ella had pressed their head against her shoulder and spoke of how the emotions would be the death of them, Star's hands were tenderly around her lover on their lower back. She smiled and shook her head. "No, Ella...I think they've finally let you feel alive. Feeling alive can be pretty overwhelming sometimes, take it from your big crybaby lover," she said with a giggle. She of course saw nothing wrong with crying, and she just let it happen whenever it felt like she needed to. She let Ella go after the squeeze and turn and walk away. They needed a minute, it seemed. Star let them have it, but kept pace behind them. She was feeling good. Her happiness was easily felt mixed in with her elated love for her darling. When propositioned to cuddle up on the beach, she smiled and nodded. When they got to the beach, she reached both arms out to produce a towel from her magical pocket. Larger than a towel, rather. Something specially made to lay out on a beach. Room enough for them both with plenty to spare on all sides. She fluffed it in the air a few times. Water was dripping from her braids and tail - because they still very much had vulpine features. She shook her tail a bit to get it to get most of the water out, but it was going to stay damp for a while as it dried in the sun, and wouldn't get poofy until it was dry. She laid the beach towel out for them, keeping it nice and flat, then reached out with her toe to tap the edge of it, which lit up the edges of the cloth with a soft blue light for a moment. A little magic, it seemed. The effect would be fairly noticeable, as when stepping onto the cloth, the sand clinging to the feet of the two women would be barred from entering, as if the sand was pushed up against a wall to then drop down onto the beach again. A sand barrier, it seemed. Star had about as much martial prowess as a particularly unskilled farmhand, but she sure did have all sorts of mystical magic to work with to compensate. Star laid herself down first, stretching out on the spacious cloth, and in doing so very much giving Ella a show of her nude figure in full, now glistening with the drying sheen of ocean water clinging to her perfect, pristine skin. She had no embarrassment or shame to speak of in baring herself to her lover like this, though there was still some degree of self-consciousness about herself. Minor, but it was inevitable that she'd feel at least a little given her inexperience. The basket of apples was right beside the towel, intentionally of course, and Star moved to dip her hand into the basket to grab one, but waited for her lover to join her before taking a bite.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella wasn't sure she agreed. The emotions meant she was feeling alive, but the emotions were so strong she kind of didn't want to feel them that much. It wasn't that she didn't WANT to love Star, but more that she needed it in smaller doses, and needed Star's love in smaller doses to not get overwhelmed. Large emotions weren't common for her, so it was a struggle and something she had to adapt to. As they made their way to the beach, her tail flicked this way and that to try to get the water off of it. All of this was an odd feeling, and she looked back at her tail before looking to see Star coming out of the water too. Star had nothing to be insecure about, considering as she walked out Ella's eyes were on her the whole way to her setting up the beach towel, and showing off the magic of it. Ella didn't move, eyes seemingly locked on Star's ass, then running up and down her body when she turned to lay down on the towel first. Desire was obvious, but it wasn't just lust that Ella was staring at Star with. It was also appreciation, and loving the fact that she could just take Star in like this - that Star trusted her, and wanted to be with her like this. A few moments of silence passed before she cleared her throat and blinked, looking up to Star's eyes and realizing she'd been staring. "Oh, uh. Nice trick with the sand." A sheepish smirk before she moved to follow Star onto the towel. Her own nude form was still dripping some water, and Ella may have intentionally flicked her wet tail in Star's direction so that it would flick water on her while Ella turned to lay down on the towel. And then immediately sidled closed to Star so their arms were touching, side by side, and staring up into the sky. "Nice day out for this."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was not here for this weak ass cuddle game of laying side by side touching shoulder. Once Ella was laying down, Star rolled to her side and slung one leg over one of Ella's, snaring it and pulling it between her legs. Not the sort of hold that had her sex pressing down onto Ella's thigh, because that would just lead [places] but still a tender hold. Her hand that was under her sought Ella's to hold, and the other hand holding the apple moved over Ella's abdomen after taking a bite from the apple. Hearing Ella remark on the weather was odd. She knew they didn't like small talk, unless something had changed. She didn't remark on it, but she also called what she was mildly suspicious was a bluff, a distraction, by talking about the nice day. "You're allowed to stare at me, you know. I like feeling your admiration," she said, obviously noticing the sheepishness from her lover. "Don't think for a second that I'd hold back from admiring how beautiful you are, either," she said with a giggle. "Buuut if you wanna talk about the nice weather, sure. It's definitely warmer here than it would be in my home. Probably should think about getting some warm clothes, honestly, with how soon winter will be upon us."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella was caught. She'd very much been trying to avoid the conversation about having been oogling her lover. Normally this wasn't ever considered a bad thing in her eyes, but she was in this weird place of trying not to dip into normal, playgirl habits with Star and ensuring Star knew that she wasn't just interested in her for sex, but for more. Her comment prior to getting to Myst, that she'd be more comfortable fucking Star than cuddling her, came back to mind. There was a wince as she considered how much that had probably upset Star at the time, even if their feelings for one another weren't exactly in the realm of love yet. Star moving up to actually cuddle her though was met with a smile. She hadn't been trying to avoid more direct cuddles, she'd just been letting Star lead on that - and lead on it she did. Ella had never been much of a cuddler, except a little bit after sex if it was particularly rough or taxing as part of aftercare. So with Star, she felt a bit awkward in trying to find the right ways to do it. If Star cuddled HER though, it was easier - and she could learn based on watching how Star did it. Nestling herself up into Star's hold, adjusting her leg just enough to be comfortable, she turned to press her lips lightly to Star's forehead. "Good. I like the winter. Better than summer, even when you have to deal with the cold during travels. Snow is easy to track in, you can put extra clothe son to keep yourself warmer versus summer there's only so much you can do to protect yourself from the heat, and snow is also easily made water." Not to mention, Ella had a soft spot for snow games, but that was something Star could learn later. She reached down, taking the apple from Star's hand on her abdomen and raised it to her own mouth to take a bite, before returning it to Star's hand. The other hand, holding Star's, squeezed lightly, and she gave Star a toothy - with apple still in her mouth - silly grin. She did chew and swallow before speaking again though. "I did say 'share' an apple, didn't I?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The comment about wanting to fuck Star rather than cuddle did hurt at the time, but it had, with time, transformed into something of a badge of honour for Star. Sure, that's how they felt at the time. But what about now? Obviously they still wanted to have sex. That was mutual. But it wasn't just fucking. Star wasn't the type to rub someone's face in things like that, but there was some small part of her that, as much as it acknowledged how Ella was a playgirl in the past, knew that Ella was capable of such greater emotion. Such pure adoration and love. And this was the Ella she was seeing now. Star smiled at the talk of weather. "I like winter better, too. Not that I need an excuse to cuddle up, but I remember a lot of cold nights that my heart ached for cuddles more than usual." And 'usual' for Star was already a lot. She was a cuddly woman. The notion of sharing the apple had initially confused Star. Was...That not what they were doing? What? But after thinking about it for a second, the candle lit up in her mind and recognition showed on her face. So, she took the apple and took a bite of it, then, holding the apple chunk halfway in her maw with the other half sticking out, she leaned her head towards Ella, and batted her eyelashes a few times for good measure.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella smiled at the idea of cuddling Star a lot in the winter. Yeah, she could imagine that being a thing. Another reason that she could love the winter more than the summer, she guessed. When Star took a bite of the apple and moved to offer it, by mouth, to Ella though, she blinked in surprise. Her comment about sharing had been done teasingly about stealing part of her apple. She hadn't meant sharing like this - but she sure as hell wasn't going to argue with it. After the initial moment of surprise, she leaned in and closed her teeth around the other half of the apple, her lips pressing lightly against Star's as she did. She was careful not to accidentally get Star's lip in her bite, and as she bit off her half of the apple, she pushed her tongue out to lick at the apple juices on Star's lip before returning to her laying down posture, smiling as she chewed. "That wasn't what I meant, but I'm happy to share an apple that way with you too. Maybe next time we stop to buy supplies we can get caramel or honey and cover one another in it to lick off." Well, maybe not actually cover. Both of those were extremely sticky, so to be used in specific parts and sparingly so as to not make an absolute mess, or cause any infections or anything. The last thing they needed was to get a food pushed into their body unintentionally and all the grossness that would come along with that.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star misinterpreting things would be something she classified as a happy accident. Reading too much into what Ella meant because in her mind her sharing the apple normally was already being done might have been an oops, but she was happy with the result. Her lips were left tingling, and a tiny blush crept to her cheeks. When Ella clarified it wasn't what they meant, she blushed a bit more, but giggled. "You sure did take that to the next level, huh?" she asked, more to quell her own arousal that was very much enjoying the idea of something sensual like that that involved her lover putting some honey on her chest to lick off. Sticky and would require a shower, but it could be fun. She didn't want to get too ahead of herself with the experimenting in the bedroom, and some part of her felt a little 'behind' in some way; between Nina and Ella being so experienced, and her just barely no longer being a virgin, she felt there was a lot she had left to experience. She didn't speak to it, as she didn't want her lover to feel bad for just being experienced - it truly was better than making a bunch of painful mistakes with someone where neither knew any better. Instead, she leaned into it a bit, hoping to encourage her lover while also hopefully not pushing their arousal tooooo far. "Have we stumbled on a little fantasy of yours? Does the mental image of my chest glistening with golden honey get your fires going, my darling?~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella smiled at the blush and the arousal she felt from Star at the action and words. Her free hand now moved to gently run up and down Star's shoulder, turning herself to look a bit at Star and let her gaze sweep down Star's body, then back up. Desire was still strong, and she was definitely checking Star out right now, but in her defense it was directly related to Star's question. "Love." She said, seriously. She looked up to meet Star's eyes and smirked. "You do not need to add anything to your body for you to taste sweet and perfect to me." And after that cheesy as fuck line, she leaned in and pressed her lips softly to Star's. Gentle, pressing in to tease an actual kiss, and then immediately pulling away once one started. Intentionally working to keep Star on the edge and wanting the kiss. "But to actually answer your question." She said, as if she hadn't done anything at all, looking back down to Star's chest and running a finger down the center. "Honey works well for what you're talking about, and I do enjoy it, but you know what is actually the best?" She dropped her voice low, husky, and looked up under lidded eyes back to Star. "Grinding on you, soaking you with the arousal you've caused, and then licking and kissing it off of you. Even better than honey."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't just let Ella look at her. She pulled slightly back, pulling her hand that was holding the apple away to leave the apple balanced on Ella's abdomen, and daintily placed her hand over the upper portion of her breast as she inched slightly back from Ella to give them a full show of her figure. She wore a set of bedroomy eyes and fluttered her lashes some more, this time in an alluring rather than cute way. Body language that said very clearly: 'stare at me all you like'. The cheesy line was received with a soft giggle, and a brief mental flash of desire that told her to say fuck it and sit on Ella's face. She did not, but she did want to. Their following description about grinding on her and then licking up the arousal didn't help. She bit her lower lip, showing off one of her vulpine fangs as it pinched a little into her lip. Not enough to hurt of course, but it did subtly accent her plush lips if Ella was looking. "You're dangerous, Ella...You stir things in me that I've never felt before. Mmnh..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella could feel the arousal and desire from Star. God, it was hard to resist doing things again. And when Star admitted she was making things stir in her? Ella decided fuck it. They'd spent this whole time resisting more, might as well take advantage of their limited privacy. Before Ella threw caution to the wind, she raised her head enough to scan their surroundings again. One more sweep to ensure they were safe and alone, and assuming they were, she moved to where she was laying on her side and moved her left hand to wrap around Star's waist. The apple was lightly tossed to the side, before she pulled Star directly against her. Skin to skin, fully, and she leaned in to brush her nose against Star's. "That's a good thing. Because..." She considered the submissive tendencies that she'd seen and felt from Star. How much Star enjoyed the idea of being all but rutted to make a baby this morning. She slid her hand down to Star's ass, lightly gripping it and using that as leverage to pull her even closer, to create pressure between them. "You're mine, and I'm going to continue to make you feel better things over, and over, and over, again." The possessive words were very hit or miss with some people, but she was willing to bet that they'd work well here, along with the possessive grip she had on Star right now. She of course actively monitored what she was feeling from Star right now, ensuring that she wasn't doing anything she was uncomfortable with while leaning in to press lips to Star's again. This time, she didn't pull away or tease the kiss. No, she deepened the kiss immediately, drawing Star into it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt the rising arousal and the lack of resistance to it. Well, at least the ocean was right there? Star blushed as her lover pulled her into them. A little squeak of surprise as heat rose up on her cheeks. The domineering talk, the possessiveness, the promise of making her feel so good...It definitely did things to her. The submissive feelings rose. Her legs quivered. A little shudder went up her spine, barely felt on the surface yet rocked her core. She gave a submissive nod, a nod of acceptance of their words, and through her aura Ella could see and feel how her arousal bloomed and shouted a very clear 'yes please'. There was no discomfort. Only acceptance and delight. She pushed into the kiss, gently moaning into it. Just a tiny one. Just a little warmth leaving her as her lover claimed her lips. Her ears flicked atop her head and her tail began to flick behind her. The hand on her ass was thusly battered with mostly-dry fluff as her tail excitedly wiggled and waved back and forth. A bit of an obvious tell that didn't require auramancy that she was excited. She was already naked, so...She just kissed Ella back and let them take the lead, as she was left feeling too submissive to take charge with her lover being so forward.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She smiled into the kiss, feeling the moan, the arousal and desire that Star had to being claimed. Ella kissed her softly, but with obvious intent. She didn't want to bruise or be rough with Star, and at the same time she made clear through the kiss that she was the one kissing Star - that she was in charge with it, pulling away if Star tried to return it herself any. A teasing game if Star tried, or otherwise letting her give in to those submissive desires if not. Her hand slid up and a single finger traced the base of Star's new tail, circling it slowly and gently. Considering her reaction previously, she was careful not to focus this, to just give a single circle before sliding her hand back down to Star's ass. She traced the curve, then down to her inner thigh from behind, just letting her fingers touch and explore without a goal of doing anything to directly pleasure during the kiss. When she pulled away, she did so slowly - moving her lips down to Star's chin, then to her neck. Kissing around her neck, up to her jawline, just taking a moment to explore Star's skin with kisses and licks. Despite the lust and arousal, she wanted this to be closer to Star's kind of love making. Not the fuck they'd had in the forest before, though probably not quite as intimate as their initial lovemaking. A middle ground between focusing on Star's pleasure, and ensuring that there was plenty of intimacy as they did it. So, as her lips crested up to where her human ear would normally be, she stopped and pulled back, looking at her with a serious gaze. "Tell me what you want, Star. Tell me how you want me to touch you." Going with the idea of keeping her in a submissive mood, her voice came out commanding, demanding. She wanted Star to learn to express her desires, and that doing so pleased Ella.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's body lit up with pleasure and shuddering delights as Ella began to touch her sensually. Her head reared back as they dipped into her neck, and her legs quaked and toes curled when the base of her tail was touched. Extra sensitive now that it had dried. Star did not try to push forcibly into the kiss or try to own it. She let Ella take her however they wanted and submitted to their desires. But then they pulled back and began speaking into where her ear would have been, which had been overtaken by her hair in its place, and put it to her to describe what she wanted. She swallowed a lump in her throat. "I-It's too reckless to ask for w-what I truly want," she admitted, honest as ever. She wasn't going to be able to get the image of little Luna out of her mind, and her entire body ached for it to be real. That life, that slow and calm existence with Ella, that's what she wanted more than anything. To be able to call them her wife and the other mother of her daughter. Or, daughters, as the dream suggested. To be pregnant with her lover's baby. She was lost in those fantasies, and her sex was clenching and leaking to an almost embarrassing degree just thinking about it, and how desperate it made her. But that was not something she could have now. It was the wrong decision, and even with her horny brain, she knew that. So she thought of anything else that she could say instead. "I-I...I don't know if it's...Is it something people do where they...U-Uhm...Rub against each other? Down there?" A nervous question, something she had certainly heard about, but not only did she really know how much it actually worked as a sex position, but also whether it was something Ella was comfortable with. It wasn't really them just touching her, it was more of a mutual sex act, but in the moment she was terribly fixated on the idea of hip-on-hip action.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella bit her lip, considering the first comment. Was there something she could do to cause that feeling without actually doing it? She thought back to a few toys she'd splurged on back home, but she hadn't exactly brought those with her when she left - and certainly hadn't bought any on her travels. There weren't exactly a lot of places that made them; her old ones had been specially commissioned from someone who was skilled enough at metalworking she could guarantee there wouldn't be anything causing pain or issues with it. So, lacking those, she had her fingers. But when Star changed her request to more direct rubbing, of both of themselves, she smiled and nodded. "Good girl." She approved, complimenting her for sharing her desires. The words weren't needed for Star to Feel that Ella enjoyed hearing what Star wanted. Even if Ellesandra was in charge right now, Star telling her how to pleasure her, how she wanted it, was something Ella enjoyed. With the goal of making Star feel as good as possible, knowing what she wanted or what she was in the mood for would help her a lot. And while that might not always be necessary verbally, with Star's shared auramancy, Ella was still in the habit and used to asking for that type of thing. And hearing Star verbalize it was just as sexy as it would have been otherwise. So she lightly pushed at Star, to push her to lay back down on the blanket. She moved to hover over Star, throwing one leg over her entirely to straddle. She would keep Star's request in mind, but she didn't go straight for grinding herself against Star. No, she pressed their bodies together, grinding herself down Star's abdomen to just below her naval, then back up. Letting her feel the arousal and desire coating Ella, that she'd been fighting off again and was back easily once it was given attention. Her lips continued down Star's neck, over her collarbone, and she began a very slow progress down, letting her own heat press against Star in a way intended to let Star feel her, more than it was to draw any direct pleasure for herself.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Being called a 'good girl' certainly hit Star in the submissiveness. A bright red blush rose up to her cheeks and her lips trembled. Being moved onto her back, as well, was enough that her thighs had to press together. Her lover wanting her, gently taking charge in their lovemaking, was certainly doing all the right things to her. She swallowed a lump in her throat and assumed her position below her lover, letting them dictate the way things would happen. The exchanged feelings did plenty to assure her that this was what her lover wanted, too. And in truth, this helped her come to understand a bit more about what Ella liked so much about their chosen way of lovemaking. The sight of seeing Ella on top of her, silver hair glittering in the sunlight, rubbing their sex on her abdomen...It didn't stimulate her at all, but by all that was good did it turn her on. She couldn't just lay and do nothing, but she didn't want to break the unspoken rules of being the submissive in the situation, so while the kisses trailed down her, and hot moans started to leave her, she moved her hands to Ella's hips, about the only place she had found that worked well so far, and squeezed them tenderly, letting her own arousal dictate how hard she squeezed into her lover's weak spot to act as a gauge for how turned on Star was getting. As if her auramancy wasn't already showing the blazing arousal plenty to her lover without it.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella could tell how much Star was liking this, and that did a lot to her. The moans as she just kissed her skin was additional bonus for Ella, her newfound ears twitching at the sound. And when Star gripped her hips, Ella groaned. Her body twisted, pressing herself more into those hands, and then grinding herself down Star to the point where she was hovering right over Star's own heat. Of course, with Star's thighs closed, she couldn't exactly press herself down on Star's heat directly, but there was no denying the tickle of her hair across the top of Star as she was brushing close to it. She straightened up to sitting directly upright, her hand moving to be placed between Star's breasts. She considered giving them more attention, but considering how aroused they both already were and Star's request for this specifically, she would leave them for another time. Her eyes scanned down Star's body either way, taking in her nude torso slick with Ella's own arousal, then back up to meet Star's eyes. Her own breasts, while smaller than Star's, were arched up lightly in her angle and as she pressed down. Just so Star felt her wetness directly on her, not to grind, and she smiled. Not yet doing what Star wanted, but close. "Be vocal, love. Tell me what you're liking. I don't want to depend on your aura telling me. I want you to tell me every thing you like, everything that feels good. I want to hear everything about your experience as you cum." Her words alone were turning herself on, the idea of hearing Star say any of this, of doing any of this. Ella knew what she herself liked, and she was very ready for Star to start giving this to her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star seeing Ella sitting straight up on top of her was an alluring sight. Something that Ella would feel. She enjoyed that feeling of being under them. Of being 'small'. Not literally so, but that she was at the mercy of her lover. She was just about to reach up and grab at Ella's chest and play with their nipples when she was given an order to be vocal about things. She blushed hard at that command, but nodded obediently. "M-Mmn...I-I like seeing you on top of me...I-I like feeling your heat on me. I like when you kiss me...I want you to touch my boobs, a-and I c-can't stop thinking about...a-about...N-Nnh.." She already had alluded to what she was fantasizing about. She wasn't saying it, because she needed to stop herself from getting any more fixated on it. "I want to cum together with you, E-Ella..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella bit her lip, feeling Star's arousal, and then hearing her express her desire. She knew what Star couldn't stop thinking about, and had an idea in mind to give something...kind of like it. Not exactly, but it might meet that desire if Star closed her eyes. "Good..." She purred out, wanting Star to know she did well with speaking up about it. She turned her eyes down to Star's breasts, smiling, and then moving her hand over to run across it. Her fingers pressed into flesh of her breast, gently massaging as she moved her hand up to her nipple, where she brushed her palm across - and then closed her fingers in around it. A very, very gentle pinch. Not enough to really cause pain, but enough to get an idea of if this was something that Star responded well to. While doing this, she had begun to press herself down more. Just enough so that her lips were brushing close to where Star's clit would be, but at this angle not actually touching. Smearing wetness just over it, and doing a kind of teasing like Ella had done with her mouth down there the first time. Ensuring that Star felt her heat so close to her own, yet not actually touching like she initially requested. Not yet, while Ella moved to the other breast, repeating the same motions, with her right hand resting just on Star's left side.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star squirmed under the pleasures of Ella touching her chest. Her nipples were very sensitive, and the attention with just Ella's palm was plenty. Light pinches felt good, too. "N-Nnaaahh...S-Sensitive.." she cooed. It wasn't too much for her. But the pinching had to be delicate, or else it would get to be too much for her easily. Her body seemed quite delicate in a lot of places, to the point that if Ella did try to be rough and give a proper bruising fuck, not only would it have not been what Star liked, but it would have actively been too much, and actually been uncomfortable for her just from the stimulation side of things. She was like a flower, or butterfly. A light touch was all that was needed. Too much and she squirmed with discomfort. A little pinching or nipping was good; she could handle it, and it was a pleasant spice to add to the bedroom, but it was easy to give too much of that. She bit her lower lip again as she squirmed, then moaned out. "I love when you touch me, Ella...I love being yours, I love letting you do whatever you want to me..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella noted the feeling of pinching, and how sensitive Star was. When she repeated the actions on her other nipple, she less pinched and more just took her nipple between fingers and rolled it lightly, to give sensation of being held without the small squeeze her pinch had given. She focused on one, then the other, smiling when Star moaned again. "Good." She said, satisfied and looking up to Star. Her hand moved up to take Star's chin and force her to look at Ella, thumb on the front of her chin and lightly tilting her head the right way. "Because you are mine." The possessive words came with a rumble in her chest, as if she were growling. That...was new, considering the animalistic form she was in now, and her tail swished one way then the other. Maybe that would work with possessive play too. She considered, but then shook her head and slid down Star again, moving to spread Star's legs and rest her knees between them. She reached down, hands squeezing at her outer thighs...and then slowly lifting them, lifting her legs up so that her calves were resting on Ellesandra's shoulders. She was slow with this, positioning herself so that Star could have her legs up like this without straining herself. Her hands ran up and down the tops of her legs, looking down between Star's thighs to the wet, swollen heat between them, then looking up Star's body back to her face. She slowly spread her own knees, then lowered the front of her own heat to press directly against star's. Not full grinding, not without putting her leg between Star's, but what this did do was press her clit directly against Star's. She couldn't grind her full slit down like this, and it forced Star's legs to stretch back up towards Star a little, but it did give them that connection Star was looking for. And, as she pulled back and pressed in again, the rubbing was a very similar motion to if she had certain other equipment and was thrusting, just a little bit lower than her current position.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's face flushed bright red and the embarrassment, arousal, and submission from being told she was theirs was very much flush within her aura for Ella to feel. Her chest fluttered with butterflies that were so potent and concentrated that it felt like her chest was going to burst. Her body trembled, shuddering from shoulders to hips in a wave of delights that left her breathless and releasing a healthy dose of her nectar from her sex. Their vulpine forms had some effect on this, encouraging the dominance and submission just a touch more. Star's tail lifted and bat down on the towel a few times before she realized she was very literally wagging her tail in excitement, and a little embarrassment had her reigning it in so the heavy, repeated thuds against the sand ceased. She of course moved her legs along with Ella's guidance, wanting to make it as easy as possible while also showing what a good girl she was. The position evoked some natural responses; she knew Ella didn't currently have the equipment needed to put a baby in her from this position, but it certainly evoked that same desire, which was both good and dangerous. Good, because it turned her on enough that her hips were shaking lightly under Ella's hips pushing against her while also eliciting some whimpering moans. Dangerous because it very seriously crossed her mind to just...Give Ella that tool and beg them to fuck her and give her that cream pie that Ella said they liked so much. She didn't, but goodness did it make that longing worse. "M-My chest feels like it's on fire, Ella," she said between soft, trembling moans. "You feel so good against me...I want you so badly, n-nngh..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt the combination of submissiveness and the desire. It stoked every ounce of dominance in her. Star's tail thumping on the ground beneath them made her smile, her own tail whooshing response. The desire felt from Star was enough to make her groan alone, without any stimulation. The knowledge that Star wanted her so badly, needed her, did a lot for Ellesandra. It stoked every desire and need to be wanted and needed by others, to be valued, to have a place to belong. It was why she generally found people to lay with, to get that feeling if even for a brief night. She looked down at Star as she spoke about how it felt. How her chest hurt with need. Ella moved her hands down to Star's hips, using them to keep Star's legs up and balanced while grinding herself down. It was awkward positioning for her own legs, pushing her muscles in her thighs. It was worth it though, as she lowered and began to slowly grind against Star. From the bottom of Star's slit up to her swollen nub in the light thrusting motion, her own clit was rubbed along and pressed against her. Then again. Over and over as the pleasure began to spread in her, the stimulation shooting through her at each touch, but even more the pleasure of just the intimacy and connection of pressing herself directly against Star like this. It was a perfect setup for the more intimate connection for them, notwithstanding how it made the more animalistic part of her right now purr at Star so happily submit beneath her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's moans and cries of pleasure came in force when Ella began to grind properly against her. Shivers and shudders ran through her hips and spine as the pleasures mounted. Her heat redoubled and a rush of her hot nectar flowed from her in a physical manifestation of her desires. Her aura burned with need and affections alike. The mixture of intimacy and pursuit of pleasures left her gripping at the towel with white knuckles, for the combination was the perfect mix to both sate and stoke the burning in her chest. "J-Just like that..." she whined, need suffusing her every syllable. "I-I love you, Ella...I-I love you so much, n-nnh...Nnh you feel so g-goooood..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt the pleasure, and heard it from Star. It caused her eyes to close and hands to tighten on the outside of Star's thigh's. The position was awkward for her and a workout for her legs, but it was entirely worth it. The way she moaned, and expressed her love for Ella, felt overwhelming to her - in a good way. Her heart beat heavily, joy mingled with a very small current of disbelief still, but that was completely overshadowed by happiness and returned loved. The thing was, from a physical standpoint, this felt good for Ellesandra as well. She felt the pressure and friction against her own clit and groaned out, but it really showed the type of lover that she was in that this physical pleasure was nothing compared to the satisfaction and pleasure she got from hearing and feeling Star beneath her like this. From feeling the heat and arousal, the desire and how Star was so wet for her, directly with her own heat. To feel their arousals mixing, her clit pressing and sliding down Star's heat. It was intimate, but the feel of her was enough to almost send Ella over the edge alone. She held back, just enough to ensure that when Star came, she could come too. Her new tail, which had previously been wagging in happiness and joy, began to straighten tightly as she worked to hold off the pleasure, to ensure that she didn't cum until Star was in the process. She wasn't as loud as Star was, just in general, but even she was breathing heavily and moaning when that time came. Pleasure was shown in every expression on her face, and she'd opened her eyes to be able to see Star beneath her like this - because that sight turned her on and filled her with love. When their orgasms hit? Ella gripped Star's thighs and hefted her off of the towel, slamming herself directly into Star in the process and holding both of them there, against one another, to go through the orgasm together, their juices mixing and soaking eachother. Her hands gripped hard enough that there was a brief jolt of pain in Ella's right hand from the old injury, but her head was so clouded with pleasure that she hardly noticed it.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could, despite the cloudy haze on her mind, discern the differences of what made Ella feel so incredible. Perhaps not enough to understand it all perfectly in the moment, as all she really could focus on was trying to not explode from all this pressure inside her. Or at least, that's what it felt like. She rose up to her orgasm swiftly enough that Ella wouldn't be fighting back against it for long, and when the two did reach that climax together, she arched her back hard as she could given the position as her head threw back and her clenching, pulsing sex squirted her love nectar out to splash against her lover and make quite the dark spot on the cloth below, as well as give a fair amount of leaking down across her pert rear. She called out her lover's name while cumming. Her love, her pleasures, carried on the winds with her lung-emptying cry of pure bliss. She held onto the feeling, and indeed brought her hand to hold onto Ella's left hand to squeeze it as their hand squeezed her hip; her trembling hand clenched lovingly and tightly against her lover's to convey, more than her aura and cries of pleasure already were, how she was brought to the heights of bliss. Her orgasm sustained and chained with a sudden, secondary, smaller one from the quivering of her hips that rubbed her clit against her lover's while she writhed in the bliss of her first. That second shock sent a jolt through her that sent her flying up to the heights of bliss and finally released all the tension in her body, leaving her to fall limp, panting, and blushing brightly as she came down from this high. In the wake of it? Her eyes looked to her lover, and wordlessly did she raise her arms up, inviting her lover down to hold her, cuddle with her. The need for that aftercare was obvious in her face, let alone her aura.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt her pleasure rise to heights she'd not felt with other lovers. Felt the joy at feeling Star respond like this, to feel her push into a second smaller orgasm just from their own touching, to feel her soaking Ella - and honestly Ella soaking her in return, even if she wasn't AS messy - she could honestly say she had never before felt so good. As Star's body seemed to melt and fall limp, Ella needed no encouragement to move down and lay atop Star, cuddling close. She was careful not to brush or grind for either of them, and placed her head lightly on Star's chest. Her breaths were coming fast, ragged, and she'd closed her eyes and run fingers up Star's side, then wrapped them beneath Star's arms and slightly around her shoulders, just what she could get to in this position. Her own body still had small aftershock tremors going through it, one that caused her left leg to jerk suddenly as a wave of pleasure continued to shoot through her. She groaned softly, just feeling her body coming down from the peak, and held Star. No words were needed, and hopefully Star wouldn't feel upset that Ella hadn't returned the loving words Star had given before. Ella felt love for Star - of that, there was no doubt. Star would be able to feel it. But Ella didn't say it, didn't feel like she needed to and right now, she needed all the air for recovering.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

A lovely consequence of auramancy was the ability to communicate without needing words. Exhaustion was as good a reason as any to not be able to return those affectionate words, so there was no sadness or pain to be felt from Star. Just happiness and love. So much love, all for Ella. She moved one hand to gently stroke Ella's lower back, mindful not to touch their scars as always, and the other just tangled her fingers in their silvery hair and cradled their head against her chest. Her heartbeat was rapid and strong, thudding for Ella to feel against their temple. No words were needed...But that small piece of Star that was within Ella blossomed with life, love, and strength at their close union. It soothed Ella. Despite working their legs so strongly during, there was no lingering soreness to be felt anywhere - legs, or in their injured hand. That single spark of life and love within them from Star caressed each muscle to keep it lovingly nursed, ensuring that Ella was free to just melt into these loving cuddles. A little kiss came from Star, landing on top of Ella's head, but otherwise the silence remained while the two caught their breath and came down from their orgasms.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella was a little surprised at the lack of soreness, and how Star's...spark in her just seemed to help soothe everything. That was quite convenient, and there was a brief consideration about what else that might be able to do. Could she try to control her own aura like Star did, through the little piece of love she felt from Star all the time? Ella didn't focus on it too much right now - not only was that going to potentially open up a can of worms in that Ella might begin seeing other people's auras, but she also wanted to focus on what was going on here and now, with Star against her. Star running a hand through her hair caused Ella to nuzzle into it, ears flicking as well. Her tail was wagging again, happiness steady through Ella in the recovery from their lovemaking. The kiss to her her head had her turning to look up at Star and smiling, sliding up her enough to return the kiss. Just a brief one, not wanting to start another fire of arousal. In reality, especially with how she wasn't even sore or anything from this, Ella was pretty sure they could spend all day in bed exploring different ways to pleasure one another. She would enjoy that immensely; but this wasn't one of those situations. They didn't have the courtesy of being able to do that, and so she just left the kiss to being chaste before returning her head to Star's chest, looking out over the ocean, content.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star relaxed in this position for some time. She loved this feeling. Just being against her lover, soaking up their love, being fully entangled with them, it filled her with happiness. Though, as she basked in that happiness, a clawing fit of sorrows welled in her heart. A wave of emotion no doubt brought upon by some train of thought. It was not an overpowering sadness, just a flicker of it that had her squeezing more tightly around Ella, clinging to them more possessively as she buried her nose into the top of their head and pressed a few kisses there while her lips still tingled pleasantly from the chaste kiss they had shared. Perhaps it was just a stray intrusive thought, as if anything, it was just tripling the amount of love Star was feeling in the moment, as if her love was trying to smother Ella completely while she clung to them.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella loved that she could feel Star's emotions and pleasure while they were making love. But in moments like these? Not so much. There was an obvious hesitation and reluctance in her to say anything about it, but she'd reacted with immediate concern when she'd felt something sad in Star. She wasn't sure if she should say anything, or just let Star share whatever it was when she was ready. Eventually, after the kisses to her head and Star clinging to him, she cautiously asked - "Is everything okay, Love?" Ella wouldn't push, one way or another. She opened the conversation up, made it clear to Star that she'd felt whatever it was that had been, but obviously she didn't know what had caused it. And while she knew Star was very open about those things, Ella generally wasn't. So while she'd ask, to open it up and invite Star to share, there was no pressure or intent behind her question to force Star to share. If Star just shrugged it off or didn't answer, Ellesandra would let it drop. But otherwise, the question had been asked out of concern - which spawned a little bit of that self doubt in herself. Had she done something wrong? Was cuddling like this bad? Was Star having regrets? She tried to reign those in, knowing they were unreasonable and not wanting Star to feel them just having random insecure thoughts, but it was probably too late for that.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded against her lover's head. She never took issue with her lover feeling her emotions. There were no regrets to be felt, but she didn't let the mystery linger and clarified swiftly when asked, as Ella might expect: "Of course, Ella...I love being here with you, like this. I love all that we just did. I simply had a rush of feelings, just a...Reminder of the ways I haven't been who I wanted to be, for you. The moments I've hurt you," she said, kissing her lover's head a few more times, showing how it wasn't her just wallowing in these negative emotions, but rather letting those past moments reinforce how much love she wanted to impart upon her lover. "I just want to make you happy. And hearing that I do, even feeling that I do, even knowing how things are in my mind, it just...Needs some time, and lots of me expressing my love for you and making you happy to put those bad feelings to rest. Just making me feel really clingy right now is all.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ellesandra frowned at Star's explanation. The insecurity was there, even if it wasn't enough to overpower the happiness and content feeling happening currently. She considered her words for a moment, just laying against Star, before getting up enough move and slide against Star so they were face to face. She slid to lay slightly off of Star, not because she was pulling away from the cuddle but just so that her whole weight wasn't resting on Star's stomach or anything like that. They were still pressed together, and Ella put her elbow on the ground and rested her head in her left palm, watching Star. Her right hand moved up and trailed a single fingertip up the center of Star's chest, across her sternum, then back down to her naval without looking, repeating that pattern over and over. "Star, you know I'm...broken, in many ways. If something you say upsets me it might not be your fault at all, or anything for you to feel bad about. I'm...going to panic, I think. As things happen. I can almost guarantee it." She looked down at her hand, not wanting to look at Star. There was shame there, and that sense of feeling like Star deserved better. "I need you to not blame yourself if you say something entirely normal and it effects me poorly, okay? I'll get over it, whatever it happens to be because I'm sure it will happen at some point. Just because I'm more sensitive than I should be to some things doesn't make it your job to walk on eggshells or be very careful about anything you say."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star felt she knew where Ella's words were going once they started speaking. She didn't want the fully body cuddles to stop however, so after a little quiet adoration of the touch on her sternum, Star turned to her side to hug into Ella again, legs tangling up as she wore a little pout. A wash of needy emotions was flowing over her and into Ella. Clingy, possessive emotions that made her want to be close to Ella. She tucked her head under theirs and gently shook her head against her lover. "It's not like that, my love..." she placed a soft kiss on the center of her lover's chest, here. "I'm not walking on eggshells or hiding my feelings or feeling scared to talk to you or anything. But there's a certain degree of sensitivity everyone should have for others, especially those they love. If I tell you I don't like being yelled at, I'd hope you'd make an effort to not yell at me, you know? There's no...'should be' when it comes to how you feel. How you feel is how you feel. And even if there are things I feel strongly about, things I might even disagree with you on, that doesn't change that I always want to be supportive and loving with you. But there's a lot of ways people can show support, and you won't like all of them, even if I have the best intentions." She wasn't going to point it out specifically, but her mind was filled with the memory of how she yelled at Ella and evoked fear in them and made them shrink in and apologize. Her heart cracked straight down the middle just remembering it. It hurt. And Ella would feel that rush of sadness and apologetic feelings well in her before Star let them flow back into love. To not dwell on them, but to reinforce her desire to love Ella that much more. A few more kisses on their chest followed as tears welled in her eyes. "You've become so, so important to me, Ella. I know we're going to have moments where things blow up between us but...I cannot accept losing you. And I know you wouldn't be able to just accept it either if I said I'll just 'get over it' if I'm hurt." Another kiss. "I want to be the perfect wife and mother of your children someday, after all." An admission made with some amount of nervousness, hoping it wouldn't go scaring Ella away with how deeply and how swiftly she had become attached to Ella. But truly, that was just who Star was. She was discerning and very particular about it. Love, in her heart, did not spawn easily. Affection and care for friends was common. She would do a lot for even strangers just because she wanted to spread that goodness in the world. But love? She'd met hundreds, perhaps thousands of people in her travels, and it wasn't until she met and spent time with Ella that love finally blossomed in her heart. She knew that if she let this go, her entire life might pass without her falling in love again. Ella was the one. Her one and only.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There was doubt, as Star spoke. Not that Ella doubted Star's words themselves, or the truth to her feelings. She didn't - it was quite hard to do that when you could actually feel them from your partner directly. She just took in a deep breath, then let it out as a sigh while wrapping her arm around Star to pull her up against Ella tighter, giving the closeness and clingyness more to Star. "I'm just waiting for the bad thing to happen. I don't know what that'll be. I just know it'll happen." Sure, she believed that Star was serious right now about wanting to be with Ella forever. About wanting to be her wife, to raise children together. But Ella just...didn't believe that she could get there, herself. She wanted all of that, but to believe she could actually have it? They were on a very dangerous adventure right now to save Star's mother - and perhaps even put a stop to whatever Valentina was planning. There was so much ripe with danger and possibility for things to go wrong, for Star or Ella to get hurt. For Valentina to decide not to play the god-like political game with Sapphire and instead just swoop in and slaughter her or their companions. She felt like things had almost been going TOO well. She and Star were like this, they'd stopped Valentina's plot to kill people in Neet, Valentina had called her 'generals' back in a supposed truce, and she was able to be with Star like this even more. It was too good, and she was just waiting for something she could never expect to deck her from behind with a haymaker or something. To knock her off balance and ruin all of this good - because she didn't deserve this good. She didn't deserve Star, even if Star was willing to drop to her level in a relationship. And the gods were cruel, Ella knew. They'd interfere somehow, make that dream of a relationship and house just not real. She had no doubt about that, even if she would keep working towards it. These were the doubts that filled her right now, even as she'd felt Star's sadness at the memory of unintentionally hurting Ella and all of the other love in her. Even if, and that was a large if, Ella didn't do something to fuck their relationship up, she had no confidence outside factors wouldn't eventually tear them apart.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ella's doubts weren't terribly surprising for Star, but she still brought her lover closer and squeezed upon feeling it. She didn't know what exactly was bringing such doubt, but in her mind she just wanted to show even more love in the face of it. "I'm sure a lot of bad things will happen...And that's why I need you with me, Ella. I want to believe I could face anything to get back to my mother but...There's a part of me that doubts how okay I would be, knowing what is out there waiting in opposition. So I'm going to need you, Ella. I'm gonna need you to be here with me. I won't make it without you," she said, planting one more kiss on her lover's chest, then trailed kisses up to her lover's jaw to then take their lips in a soft, loving kiss. Chaste and gentle, she didn't hold it too long, but needed that warmth to fight against the rising doubts and fears. She then brushed her nose against Ella's and gave a soft vulpine coo as her tail sprung to life to flick a little behind her. "I'm sorry about this...sad distraction from our happy post-sex cuddle time. I don't want to make you sad. Play with my ears so we can feel better?" At that invitation, her ears did flick a little, though she would be the last person to deny Ella if they needed more time to sort through these other emotions. In her mind, these were nothing particularly new, and she didn't want to attach any negative feelings to their love-making, because truly all of her sudden sadness had been entirely unrelated.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella held Star and returned the kiss when Star moved up to her lips again. The apology caused her to shake her head. "Nothing to apologize for, love." At the invitation to play with her ears, a smile tugged at Ella's lips and amusement stirred in her. Those doubts were there, and weren't going to go away quickly - or ever, entirely - but there was definite amusement at how Star had decided distraction was the right option here. "Taking a page from my book though, huh?" She asked, reaching up and running fingers through Star's hair, then lightly rubbing at the base of those ears before running a finger up the long back of one of them. There was something giddy in her about playing with these ears. She couldn't explain it, had no idea why she enjoyed playing with them more than she would Star's human ears, but her tail thwaked against the towel multiple times as she'd started to play with them. "I wonder what limits there are to your shapeshifting?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled giddily at her lover when they took up her offer. Her tail thumped against the sand pleasantly as she received the affections. She pushed her head into the affections and rubbed into her lover's hands with vulpine delight. She giggled. "I'm not gonna go distracting from any serious things, unlike someone I know. I just don't need to make you sad all day about what really was just an intrusive thought. You know I'm always going to be honest about that stuff but...It's really okay, you know? It's only just pushing me, reminding me that love is...Something you always have to care for and nurture." She kissed at her lover's jaw once more at this notion, then gave a bit more of a nervous giggle about the following question. "W-Well, it's magical, so...I imagine the answer to that is entirely dependent on my magical abilities and how much work I put into it. But from what I feel from it now, applying qualities of any person whose aura I've felt in the past is pretty straight forward. It was, uhm, hard...T-To uhm...You know...Resist changing a certain part of you, what with all this...baby fever I have, e-eheh..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella looked curious at the thought, and then pulled back to look into Star's eyes. She continued to pet and play with her vulpine ears, delighting in that, but there was also a look of curiosity. And a small amount of insecurity, but it wasn't too much right now. "Do you, um. Prefer people who would have that?" She shifted a little, wondering if perhaps Star didn't just have baby fever, but also would have preferred if Ella were a man. They had never really discussed sexual orientations with one another, and was Star mostly straight? I mean mostly was still bi and that was kind of biphobic, she reminded herself, and Star had obviously been aroused by Ella, which is the only reason her insecurity wasn't going out of control. But that didn't mean Star might not have had a preference, and if there was more behind that than just baby fever and wanting to be bred, it would be good for Ella to know. It would tell her what kinds of things she might need to do more of, to keep Star interested with her feminine form instead.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star blinked, tilting her head to the question. "Huh? No, not specifically," she said, open and honest as ever. She then blushed, and shrunk into herself a little. "Ijustwantyourbabyokay?" She pushed her head under Ella's again, hiding her blush as she pushed more into her lover. A deep breath in, then a huff. "Don't you go getting insecure thinking I don't love everything about you...But, well, I don't have any preference about uh...'Equipment' s-so...Do whatever you want with that information, okay?" Truly, she would delight just as much with grinding slits against each other as she would being pounded by a rigid shaft. Different, yet equal pleasures would be what Ella would feel should they ever experiment with that. Though this line of questioning had her thinking for a moment. "....D-Do, uh...Do you have any preferences..?" Star never imagined herself with a phallic tool in bed, but...If Ella wanted it, she would have no complaints. She did assume Ella was far more interested in the feminine figure with all that entailed, given her understanding of Ella's past interests, but she kept an open mind about it.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt herself smirk at how blushing Star got at admitting she wanted Ella's baby. And Ella wanted to raise a family together - even if now wasn't a good time for it. She squeezed Star softly, then considered Star returning the question. There was a wince at the idea of being penetrated that way. A vulnerability about it that Ella just wasn't truly okay with. There was more to her desire to just please her partner than that being what she enjoyed; she'd told Star that being the focus of those intentions instead made her uncomfortable. Guarded, was the best way to phrase it. But would she be open to trying that, with Star? "I..." She said, then considered the idea of doing it just for the pregnancy of it. Just to be able to carry her own child, an idea she hadn't ever even considered. "I've been with a transwoman before. I enjoy the equipment you have more than anything, but I'm not against pleasuring you while you have other equipment. It was an interesting and nice change of pace. But the idea of more conventional sex with a penis, I'm not a fan of. It's a possibility, for perhaps only the idea of sharing the risks of pregnancy with you." Pregnancy was a risky thing, but she was concerned about that idea too - watching Star curiously. "Do you know if I carry a child, if auramancy is an option for them too? I'm not sure how that really works, honestly." Ella hadn't also ever considered carrying a child a possibility before, so she wasn't sure if she wanted to. But she also knew she didn't want Star to have to be the one to do that, considering how many mothers died in childbirth if they didn't have competent healers or doctors around to help.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star listened carefully. Knowing what her lover wanted was an important subject for her, and the nervousness and insecurity about having other equipment vanished when Ella said they preferred what she already had. She gently nodded at that. She didn't say it outright, but it did seem she was most comfortable staying as she was. The question that followed about how things would work for their child if Star was the one to impregnate Ella was an interesting one. "I...Don't know for sure, if I'm honest, but I'd have to assume it would pass on. I don't know a lot of details about...THAT side of things given how young I was when I got separated from my mom but...I know at least that one time I asked her what my name would have been if I was a boy, and she told me that because both her and Robin are women that I was guaranteed to be a girl as well. I don't know what exactly that means but, uhm, I suppose it does at least affirm what we might expect in the future for that..." It had truly stuck in her mind, that shared dream, as reality. She wasn't truly intending on speaking about it as some foregone conclusion that Ella had somehow already agreed to one-hundred percent, but she was definitely latching onto the happiness that she felt in both of them at the prospect. "Obviously you don't have to have any specific reasons for your preferences but...Is there anything more to that? You mentioned before you don't like your own orgasm, and I don't wanna pry around or anything but...I can't help but be a little curious about what thoughts you have swirling up in that adorable head of yours sometimes...Or, well...All the time, honestly.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She raised an eyebrow at the idea that they would only be able to have girls. She wasn't against that, but there was a curiosity as to why that was the case. Ella had no specific preferences for a girl over a boy, though now that she'd seen that potential future given by the Spire, she wanted Luna. Wanted her in her lap, trying to make a little flower crown for Star just like had happened in the dream. Ella didn't think Star had seen what Luna was doing, but even though that was a dream and not something that actually happened, Ella would keep that Luna's secret. She wouldn't share what she'd been doing. As for her preferences, there was a kind of noncommittal shrug. "I don't really know, it's just uncomfortable and not my preference." With the benefit of Auramancy, she'd be able to see that Ella was telling the truth. She didn't know. But there was so much more that was actually causing it. Plenty for a therapist to work through with Ellesandra, the type of self-worth issues that made it hard for her to accept someone doing things for her, instead of her doing things for them. Ellesandra was a giver because every 'gift' she'd received had had strings attached. Her housing and her position had been thrown away when she didn't do exactly what they wanted, people who had given her safety had taken that safety away at the first 'wrong' thing Ella had done. So opening up, letting herself accept that kind of focused attention on herself, wasn't something that came easy to Ella - even if all of this eschewing of it was subconscious.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wouldn't need to look at Ella's aura to feel they were telling the truth. She trusted them. It wasn't to say she wouldn't be able to notice rather swiftly if Ella did choose to lie, but things were far different with how she would address that with Ella versus how she had called out Morrun in the past for lying. She believed Ella would not lie to her without a good reason, though knowing that reason was still going to be important at some point. It didn't take an auramancer to discern that honesty was very important to Star. So she just nodded at the words. "Well. Some stuff is like that I guess," she said, not dwelling on it and instead just giving a few peppered kisses to Ella's neck and up to their jaw, then moved to nose at their cheek a little. "And even if it was a little unexpected, your preference for pleasing me is something I am happy to indulge. It makes me feel so happy to say things like 'I belong to you'," she purred, kissing Ella's cheek after those words. "I feel so clingy with you so...If you hope to do anything else today you might have to pry me off you a little. Just a fair warning.~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella raised her head, giving Star access to kiss along her neck and jaw. She took that moment to scan the surroundings once again, another confirmation that things were safe for now before turning back and giving Star a bit of a nose nuzzle instead of letting her do it into her cheek. She smiled, sultry and with a husky voice said - "Well, you ARE mine." Her hand around Star squeezed, a possessive squeeze. Normally, she didn't let any possessiveness or anything like that come into a dynamic between her and a partner, but with Star seeming to enjoy that she didn't hold it back at all. Her hand slid down and squeezed Star's rear, before moving up her back again to the center and just rubbing gently. "Clingy is fine, since we don't have anything we have to be doing." She had changed back to her normal voice, as if what she'd done was absolutely nothing odd.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star's aura bloomed with love when the nose nuzzle was given. It was a small affection, but one she adored. Cute, innocent, and sweet. Entirely opposite of what Ella followed up with. But Star liked that, too. Her cheeks flushed hot, and Ella could feel how that declaration and possessive squeeze bubbled up those submissive feelings within her. Arousal would be there, too, but she was still coming down from the afterglow of her orgasm so the arousal was subdued. She bit her lower lip. "I am yours," she echoed, her voice quiet and obedient. "So you can do whatever you want to me, okay?" Words that were spoken to match Ella's sultry purr with her own obedient invitation. She wasn't trying to instigate more, but she had been honest with that invitation, and if Ella was going to push Star onto her back and dive down to eat her out for another orgasm, Star would happily oblige. But, like Ella, it was right back to normal after that. "If you're going to validate my clinginess then I'm definitely not gonna stop," she said with a giggle. "Hum.~ Do you like sunbathing, Ella?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella raised an eyebrow at Star saying she could do whatever she wanted with Star. On the surface, that was a good response to the claim, but underneath Ella wasn't sure she liked the idea of her being able to do anything she wanted to Star. Star had preferences, and what Ella wanted to do was to make Star feel good. But also, if something ever happened where she got mind controlled or something, she never wanted to hurt Star because Star was just subservient to her. She considered commenting on all of this, but just let it rest instead and felt Star giggle into the clingyness. Her eyes turned up to the sky for a moment at the sunbathing comment, and shrugged. "I...haven't really done much of it. Just laying around in the sun. I've always had work, or training or something to do instead. I might be out under the sun a lot, but to just lay out beneath it and soak it in isn't something I've done before." She paused, then added. "I don't like how the sun makes my skin turn red when out under it too long though. While all my friends got darker from the sun, I just got red and never darker. Not sure why."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star giggled. "That's called a sunburn, my darling. Fairly common for us pale-skinned beauties," she said with a flutter of her lashes and no shortage of a little playfulness in those words. "Getting darker would be called 'tanning'. You get a tan from being out in the sun just the right amount I suppose. Too much sun is bad, but just basking in it and soaking it up a little is fine. Some people find it relaxing. I'm hoping you do, too, though at some point we'll have to wash off again and, once we dry off, get back to annoying and difficult life matters," she said with a little mock pout. "But that's an interesting point. How does it feel, honestly? Just being able to relax, when you're used to always having work or training?" Of course, Star could see and feel Ella's immediate emotions in the moment, but it would be helpful to ask the question to evoke the more broad feelings on the matter. While they spoke, she of course made sure to give her lover tender rubs along the small of their back, occasionally dipping down to run her fingers through the fur of Ella's tail.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella shrugged at the idea of enjoying this. "I do enjoy spending time with you." She commented with a smile, leaning in and pressing her lips to Star's forehead. "But as for feeling entirely relaxed, that's not going to happen until after all of this is over." As if to indicate what she meant, she took another second to scan their surroundings before snuggling close into Star's clingyness again. "And I don't just mean me looking around and being on guard. I won't feel relaxed while I know there's threats out there actively disliking you, or meaning you or your mother harm." Ellesandra was a protector. It was what she'd been raised and trained to be, but it also was who she was. When she found people she cared about, she went out of her way to make sure they stayed safe. Even if it wasn't someone she actively cared about, but it was an innocent, she would do what she could to protect them. So in a situation like this, where she was still technically Star's bodyguard, just because she was having fun and 'relaxing' with Star didn't mean her guard was down. "And it's not like I took a lot of time for myself to relax before I met you." She added, considering how she'd thrown herself into work and travels and not let herself slow down or focus on anything internally.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled at her lover after being kissed on the forehead. "It's not like I'm without my guard as well, but you can still relax even while feeling a little on guard, can't you?" she asked, wearing a tiny pout. "Not to say we wouldn't be ready to fight at a moment's notice if we had to, even while naked," she continued, not knowing that is rather precisely what Ella had done on that fated night in Neet. "But just...Focusing on each other, you know? I know true relaxation and a happily ever after sort of thing is...Awfully far away still. But there's something to be said about how a tireless slog of danger and battling can wear on someone, and it's important to me to tend to those emotional parts of you that are so terribly neglected," she said while moving a hand up to cup Ella's cheek, stroking their cheekbone with her thumb. "I don't doubt you for a moment, of course. I know you'd rise to any challenge to protect me. And I'll be right there with you. But it makes me happy...When you're happy. And as much as you have mastered the art of just trying to ignore and repress and do anything you could to not face your own emotions...Rest, like this, and being happy are just as important for your emotional health as resting your body after pushing yourself too hard. And that's at least something I know you understand, with how adamant you are about ME taking my rests, right?~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella snorted at the naked comment. "Been there, done that. Sylvia surely got an eyeful." She HAD been wearing that coat, but while moving for a fight and doing the flips and stuff she had, there was no denying that both Sylvia and Willow had probably gotten eyefuls of her naked. Not that Ella truly cared one way or another. The father might have as well, but again - she hadn't really had much of a choice at the time. If she'd waited to get dressed and put armor on, how much more might have happened or harmed others before she'd destroyed the crystal? At the softness and gentle reassurance though, Ella felt her heart stir for Star again. "I'm not good at this...relaxing and everything, Star. I'll try, but please don't be disappointed if I don't relax and process emotions like you're used to doing." She ran her left hand back up and down Star's back, then brought her right around to lightly rub again at the base of Star's ears. "You make me happy though, Star." And she was. Happiness surged in her at being able to cuddle and hold Star like this. "So take what you can get, it's happier than I've been in years."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ella's answer evoked a warmth in Star's heart. Love, happiness, acceptance, and a myriad of other positive emotions. She still had her hand cupping their cheek. "I can only ever ask you to try your best, Ella. I could never be disappointed in you for trying your best, even if the end results aren't pretty. I know it's already taken a lot of courage and strength to come as far as you have, my love. It's one of the many reasons I love you so much," she said, smiling sweetly as her ears were rubbed. One of them lightly flicked at the attention, then they both flattened out in contentment. "And both of those sentiments are mutual. That you make me happy and...That this is the happiest I've ever been in my life. And even though I know hard times are ahead, I also know waiting on the other side is an even greater happiness for us. So all I ask right now is that you soak up the sun and soak up the happy cuddle time while you can. I'll make sure we don't catch a sunburn while we're out here, 'kay?" Words that had a small tickle of magic flowing through Ella's aura and across their skin. A pleasant cool suffused them while the sun's tender rays caressed the same plush skin. Power no greater than a cantrip, just a little magic to ensure they weren't red and sore and peeling for days after. "For the record, I don't know how I'd react if in the middle of a fight someone just ran out totally naked. I wanna say it wouldn't take me off guard but...That's definitely not something I've encountered before..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella didn't really know how to respond to Star's affirmations and compliments. She shifted a little uncomfortably, not good at taking compliments like that and fighting the urge to brush them off or contradict what Star was saying. She didn't, but it also meant that she sat in discomfort for a moment. The feeling of magic running across her skin caused her to look down at it, then look up at the sun and go - "Hah, you monster. I'm guarded against you now." It was a distraction from the compliments, trying to add humor into it again and turn attention away from how uncomfortable she'd been with it. At the comment of having someone fight them naked, Ella smirked at Star. "Well, I wasn't ENTIRELY naked that night. I did steal a jacket from the inn on my way out, so Sylvia and Willow didn't just see me full nude. I probably looked more like someone who was about to streak across the training grounds though, naked under a jacket that could be easily discarded. It didn't seem to stop them though, so I don't think nudeness will be a surprise or distraction tactic for them at least." She considered if it might have worked for Willow and she just couldn't see that, but assumed not since the magic had been working the entire time anyways.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had long since known that Ella was bad at taking compliments and positive affirmations. So rather than push them on her lover, she let them sit with them for a moment while she gently rubbed the small of their back some more. As if rubbing the compliment in, or something. She knew if she just pushed and pushed and pushed that Ella would eventually be so uncomfortable they would find a reason to rush to get dressed under the guise of needing to hunt or something, even though their allies were already doing that. Or maybe they'd try and make Star do pushups again...Regardless, Star would ensure Ella, someday, would accept her kindness. "I was a bit confused until I remembered uhm...What happened the night just before that. Somehow you being totally naked doesn't make me see you as any less of a force to be reckoned with," she said with a giggle. "I think you'll just have to settle for stabbing the bad guys the usual way instead of relying on the power of your boobs, my love. Though there's something to be said about maybe using these cute ears to disarm your opponents.." she said, then moved a hand up to scratch behind one of Ella's ears. Ella hadn't mentioned anything about changing back, so...At least for now, Star felt it was fine to just stay this way.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella rolled her eyes at the 'power of booba' beating her opponents. She looked down at her breasts, knowing she was on the smaller side. Not to mention, most of their opponents so far had been women, and she wasn't sure how many - or if any - were sapphic. Sapphire and Valentina were, obviously, but beyond that? Her boobs were not her best feature of herself, and Ella knew that. She also wasn't insecure about her physical looks, at least as long as the person looking at her was sapphic. She was short, but she generally moved with confidence. "I don't know, the cute ears weren't going to disarm them from killing the town." She said, a little more seriously than Star probably meant the comment. She frowned at that thought, then shook her head. "You sprouting cute ears would certainly distract me though." She said this as she nuzzled her head up into the attention Star was giving her ears. There was obviously pleasure and joy when Star rubbed them, a general pleasant feeling that she enjoyed.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could feel a bit of the insecurity in her lover when they looked at their own breasts. Star knew she was on the larger side, but...Did size matter to Ella? Or was it more that they thought others thought size mattered? Either way, she didn't enjoy feeling that, so she moved her hand from Ella's ear to their breast. She didn't touch their nipple, but did gently cup Ella's right breast, then smoothed her fingers along the soft skin, planting a few kisses against the top of it along with her loving rubbing. "Your boobs are certainly always a distraction for me. I love them, just as I love all of you," she affirmed, knowing this toed into the waters that had historically made Ella a bit uncomfortable, but this wasn't about pleasure as much as it was affection and tenderness. So she had to wonder if perhaps Ella might be able to accept a little attention if it was rooted in love. Rejecting good things about themselves seemed easy as could be, but...What about rejecting Star's affections? She braced emotionally, in the event Ella didn't react well to this, but she hoped she could evoke a little smile and, even if Ella themselves didn't like their own chest, she hoped they could at least accept that Star herself loved those two perky mounds.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella blinked when Star grabbed her boobs and claimed they were a distraction. "You might be a little biased, love." She said in amusement, raising an eyebrow to her. The attention in this situation wasn't unwelcome, though the compliment and focus on loving her had the same response all compliments did. She turned to lay on her back, pulling Star atop of her entirely so their bodies could lay entirely flush with one another, and smiled up at her. "Gotta get your back all nice and warm from the sun, don't want it to go without this whole sunbathing experiment, hmm?" It was an excuse to have Star atop her, not for any arousal reasons but because the weight of Star was comforting. Like a weighted blanket, and feeling her entirely against Ella was nice, skin to skin. She considered sliding her hand down and playing with her tail, but remembering how sensitive it had been she decided not to for now. As much as she probably could just have sex with Star constantly for the next few days, she did actually want quality time other than sex too. "Do you prefer sunbathing, or moon bathing?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star yipped lightly, involuntarily, when she was brought to lay on Ella. She blushed a little at having done so, but moved along like that didn't happen. She smiled at her lover. "So what if I am?" she countered, tail wagging happily. Though, despite the shift, she still gave her love onto Ella's chest, working down a little if she had to. Now, just kisses. A few on one, then onto the other, and back again. Just an idle motion to give affections. Though when the question of sun versus moon came up, her response was immediate. "Moon bathing, for sure. I've always loved the night time. It's always felt more calm. More peaceful. Some people associate the night and darkness with bad things but...I never have. The moon is beautiful, and it's no mystery that I've always found the stars above to have a certain degree of sentimentality for me." Was that because she herself liked her name, because it reminded her that her mother named her as such, or something else? Whatever the case, she didn't reject the comparison between her name and the celestial starfields above, clearly. "I'm guessing you're the same, since hot cocoa just fits so much more nicely with the cool air of night, hm?~"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella shifted a little when Star continued to kiss along her breasts now. She wasn't against it, but it felt....odd. Not like the pleasure of normally getting attention from Star, like when she pet Ella's hair or new ears, but more just that Star was doing something there. And it was a feeling. Neither positive or negative, just a thing. And she wondered for a moment why Star was doing that, considering asking her not to, but it was no harm to her - and if Star enjoyed doing it, who was she to stop that? So instead, she continued with the conversation, gracefully not commenting on the cuteness of the yip Star had made. The one that had made her tail beneath her wag a little despite laying on it. "I do prefer moon bathing as well, though not necessarily because pairing it up with hot chocolate. You're right, it's just more peaceful overall usually. Oh, there is a bit to be cautious about in not being able to see as far, which is why a lot of us humans hate the dark and are scared of it, but it's just so quiet. The bustle of the world calms down, it's cool rather than with the oppressive heat of the sun, and generally more comfortable." Ella leaned down to press a kiss to the top of Star's head. "And there's a bunch of little you's in the sky I can admire."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Feeling that her attentions weren't evoking the feeling she was looking for, Star eventually settled to just resting her head on Ella's chest. A difficult emotion sat in her stomach at the conclusion, one that was a bundled mix of negative emotions, but it was small. Hardly noticeable amidst the overwhelming love and happiness she felt just being here, skin-to-skin with Ella. Truly, that aspect of their cuddling, that they were nude, was making this so much more wonderful for Star. She adored regular cuddles plenty, but this was special for her. Their connection, their auras, were closer in this posture than they were in any other. Whether they were just cuddling or having sex or whatever it was, being nude and touching so much ensured their connection was at its strongest. Star smiled and a small burst of happiness bloomed within her at the kiss to the top of her head. She then giggled. "Little me's, huh? The only little you I've ever been able to see was little Luna," she said, with a bloom of love swelling in her heart just from saying the name. "We'll be sure to gaze up at the stars each night that we can, then, my love, and enjoy the nights we have together."

Ella didn't notice the emotion for Star. There was so much happiness and love, and Ella wasn't looking closely or searching for emotions, so the blip of other emotions had gone unnoticed. As such, she had continued to just lightly run fingers up and down Star's back while Star just rested against her, eyes closing eventually and taking a moment to enjoy their connection like this. She might not enjoy it like Star enjoyed it, but it was still really nice and something she'd never turn down if they were in a safe position to do so. "That's a...theoretical actual possible future, by the way. Not just a dream we shared. The card Freya gave me...it was showing me a possible future to fight for, I think. I don't know how true or divining it was, versus just pulling on what I wanted deep inside and making something from that, but...I'm choosing to believe that if we do things well, if we do things right, we'll get to that reality. With Luna, you pregnant, and your mother safe."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't need to be told it was possible to believe it was. Though, affirming that it was possibly the work of actual divination? Well. The thump in her chest, the way her baby fever bloomed and the blossoming love and desire for both Ella and that future were impossible to ignore in her aura. Curiously, this also ignited the small piece of Star inside of Ella, and a tingle of faint healing magic spread through Ella's body. Strange effects of auramancy, operating on unknown and unclear rules. Star curled her fingers gently inward, currently looped around Ella's shoulders, mindful of course of the scar on Ella's right shoulder. She loosed a shaking breath. "Divination or not...The moment I laid eyes on Luna, even if it was just in a dream...When I woke up, I knew we'd make it real. Through hell and high waters, we'll have that life, Ella. With plenty of time between now and then to figure out a name for that second child I was so close to bringing into our lives." Her words were filled with conviction. Whole-hearted love and determination for this future. Whatever bad thing Ella might expect to happen to ruin it all would have to contend with a very angry, very determined Star, to try and take it away from her. "And hearing you speak with that confidence..." She paused. Her love again overflowed from her heart into Ella. It was a rare moment of...Perhaps not optimism, but a lack of pessimism at least. If they did things right, they would get there. She could agree with that. Not hopelessly, blindly optimistic. But determined. "Knowing how much you want it, too...Nothing could be more emboldening. I know we'll make it happen, my love." She raised up, here, and moved to kiss her lover on the lips, sealing those words.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Somehow, Star's words triggered that insecurity, the pessimism she'd been expecting. Ella had been set on trying to get it to happen, with no actual confidence it would and was pretending that just trying was enough. She'd be damned if she wouldn't try for it. But with Star reassuring that it would happen, the only thing that could come to her mind was the thought of 'yeah, if I don't fuck it all up like I normally do'. Star was so hopeful, so determined and optimistic that they'd make it happen, and it caused her heart to constrict with pain that she was all but certain she'd fuck it up somehow. Because that's who she was - a fuck up. She'd let Marigold go off and get killed, failed in her job. She was just a lowly peasant girl, taken in by Marigold out of the kindness of her heart, trash that could be thrown away when she didn't do her job well. These thoughts flooded in and Ella swallowed heavily, turning her head up and away from Star because she knew Star would be able to feel how Ella responded to them. The happy mood turning into more of a dejected one, of the negative feelings bubbling back up. The self-hate, the doubt, the rejection. Those shadows surrounded her heart and constricted it. Those feelings would never go away, either. They might get smaller, but she knew that trauma was going to stay with her forever. And she didn't want to let the conversation change, let Star think she'd said something wrong when she hadn't. Let it focus on those. So Ella cleared her throat, trying to push those feelings away again, and keeping her gaze on the surrounding forest rather than on Star in the guise of keeping an eye out suddenly. "Don't want to talk about it." She said in a whisper. She knew Star would ask, want to know what was causing this, but she truly didn't want to talk about it or feel it right now. She tried to change the subject, if Star would let her. "Do you think Amara and Amelia are lovers? I feel like they at least relieve tension with one another while out on the road, if not having the emotional connection to it."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't say anything, but she felt it. When Ella moved to look away, Star moved up to gently cup at Ella's cheeks to hold their face, then brought her forehead down to rest on theirs a moment. Then, a small kiss before returning to keeping her forehead on theirs. "Shhh..." she cooed gently. "We don't have to talk about it. But let me comfort you, my love. Let those painful feelings work through you naturally, but focus on me. I'm here. I love you." Her words were whispers, and though she still didn't quite know the perfect way to help Ella deal with their own emotions, she tried. She tried to let her lover know it was okay to feel, while also bringing their focus back to good things. Happy things. She then smiled, considering the question. She shook her head. "I already know the answer to that and...I can't tell you without revealing their emotions. So I guess you'll just have to wonder about that, unless you ask directly." She wasn't upset. She kept a soft smile while trying to keep herself and her lover in a position that would show comfort and support for her lover to help them through the darkness.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella closed her eyes when Star pulled her back to hold her face, to look at her and coo and tell her it was okay. She took a deep breath, the focus on her and her feelings making her uncomfortable and feeling bad as well, but that was minor compared to the previous feelings. She did, however, slid her hands down to the small of Star's back and squeeze her closer, snuggling into Star with her eyes closed. Ella wasn't good at just...feeling bad emotions. She had to fight every urge she had to just push them down, and eventually that's what she began to do. She'd sat in the discomfort, in the hate for a few moments, listening as Star revealed there was something in their emotions that she knew that Ella didn't. There was a small amount of appreciation and gratefulness that came in that Star respected the boundary Ella had set previously, about not sharing things like that. It wasn't nearly as strong as the more negative emotions right now, which she was trying to push down again. "I have, though indirectly and through teasing." She added, trying to force her thoughts on when she'd teased Amelia about this very topic, and not on how she'd fuck up their potential future and that her focus on it now was going to fuck up this moment, too. "Oh well. I guess if we walk back and find them fucking, they can't really hold us doing so against us huh?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star didn't expect the negative emotions to pass swiftly. They would surely have passed through Ella in time if they were so trivial. They had been given so much power by rooting themselves inside Ella after years of pushing them down and letting them fester. So Star just exercised patience in just letting Ella feel, while she kept herself a bastion of positivity and comforts to fight against those bad emotions. Ella would talk about them if they were ready, she was sure. Though them being ready was...surely its own journey. So she was fine to talk about other things. She smiled and giggled. "I've noticed. Though I think we officially have no room to tease them about kissing when, well...If we do wind up walking in on them I will probably yelp. I walked in on Nina more than a few times. I have never slammed doors so hard in my life. Sure did teach me a lesson about being lost in my thoughts and not paying attention to the auras around me," she said with a nervous giggle. "So uh, I hope it'll be okay if I at least give you advance warning if we are ever about to walk in on that sort of thing if we ever come across it, whoever it is that might be involved." She was again purposefully vague about who this was about. She could be speaking about Amara and Amelia, purposefully allowing that to remain a vague possibility so as to not by logical deduction reveal the truth either way. "It's hard to talk in a way that doesn't just reveal what I'm trying to avoid revealing in a roundabout way," she added with a smile. "Please forgive me for when I inevitably screw that up sometime and reveal things by accident."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella considered what Star was saying. She hadn't ever considered that Star could probably tell when someone was having sex from their aura, even through walls and such. The idea felt even more invasive, though she nodded when Star requested to be able to give her advance warning in those cases. And then she smiled softly, leaning in to press a gentle kiss against Star's nose. "Thank you for being so mindful of that boundary. I know you being able to see stuff like that isn't something you can control, and I need you to know that I don't think you're a bad person for being able to see it. Or even for accidentally sharing it, as long as you aren't seeing something and then going to gossip about it." She took a deep breath and then nestled her head into the towel beneath them, eyes closed. She continued to work on pushing those shadows back down, of getting back into that happy and content place she'd been before. "Distract me with something. Tell me about yourself, something I don't know."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star wasn't sure distractions were the most appropriate measure at the moment, but she could tell that Ella needed something. So she kissed them. A loving, tender kiss. Nothing with spice or fire. Just tenderness. When that kiss broke, she lowered her head to present her ears. "Play with my ears some more. You'll have to get used to seeing me without them again once we change back, so gotta get it all out of your system now, right?~ Unless you feel like asking me to change into this form again sometime," she said, tempted to turn that into a sexual thing and talk about orders and submission and such, but did not. Not because she couldn't go for round three, but because she wanted to focus on Ella's emotions. "But you're right that I'd never want to gossip or anything of the sort. It's important to me to be respectful of boundaries. But I also know I sometimes have felt like something was important enough to breach that privacy." She paused for a moment. "...Do you feel there is ever a thing that could be so monumentally important as to supersede that privacy? If lives depended on it, sort of thing? Is there a line..? Sorry, I know this probably isn't a sunshine and rainbows sort of question just...I want to be the best partner I can be to you, so I don't wanna make any mistakes if I can help it."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella pressed into the kiss, responding gently even if her heart was distracted from the love. When she lowered her head back down and the request was made to play with Star's ears, she obliged with a soft smile on her face. That was one thing she probably would never turn down, fingers taking the thin ears between them and rubbing back and forth, then scratching at their bases. "You should change back if it's becoming taxing for you, but if it's not, then I see no reason why we can't do it more often later too. I liked seeing your tail wag when you came." The sultry smirk came to her face, though her expression turned serious as Star continued to talk about her ability to see emotions. She considered for a moment, making sure she was certain of how she felt about Star sharing someone's emotions in times of importance, before nodding and responding. "If lives are on the line, lives are obviously the more important thing there, love. I trust you to know if something is vital or important to share. Another example might be if someone is lying to us, or hiding something and acting shifty that might cause a threat, but I haven't picked up on it." She lowered Star's head, to place a kiss right between her ears and gently scratch at them at the same time before leaning back again. "Does that line sound right to you?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star smiled into the sensation of the ear affections, though being told how much they liked seeing her tail wag when she came was enough to get her heart thudding and cheeks flushed. Embarrassment surged, though it was mixed with acceptance and arousal. She liked pleasing Ella, after all. So her tail, despite herself, wagged at that news. The mix of levity in their conversation was helpful for her to not feel too weighted by what she was about to ask next. She raised up to look Ella in the eye. "What if...It's someone acting against themselves? People often have to go into situations that belie their own true emotions, fair to say perhaps that such is often misguided to do so but...It's not a lie, but certainly can result in harm. I'm...Sorry to bother you with these hypotheticals. I'm not asking these because I have something I am going to tell you depending on your answer, specifically, just...Well. There's been times I've kept quiet about things my heart tells me is right to share." She had a very specific thing in mind of course, but...Even if Ella answered to the affirmative, she wasn't sure she could actually reveal what specifically she was thinking in that moment. She'd have to think about it all, regardless. "I don't mean to bog you down with questions, just...What feels right to me, and what you feel is okay, might not always line up. Things get awfully grey in the middle, and I...Don't want to hurt you, ever."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella considered the question, pausing in her rubbing as she thought. "I'm...not sure I understand." She admitted, not entirely following exactly what Star was asking. "Are you saying they're lying to themselves and doing something against what they feel? Because if so, that's their problem to figure out. You can help guide them or try to encourage them to stop lying to themselves, but take it from someone who very much lied to herself for years; it's a defense mechanism. Pushing someone to address them might end very poorly, depending on who it is and what they're lying to themselves about." Star had said it wasn't a lie, but Ella didn't quite know what she had meant so went with the closest thing that made sense to her. There was obvious confusion though, the type of which that did, actually, distract her from the shadow feelings clamping onto her heart as she tried to puzzle it out. "Again though love, I trust you. And maybe you don't need to necessarily share the specific emotion you're seeing all the time, but if it's vital or important, maybe just point me in the right direction if it's something I need to address. You don't have to tell me someone is lying or shady specifically, just give me an indication to keep an eye on them. Or if someone needs comfort and I don't realize it, just encourage me to go over to them. You don't have to tell me what feeling needs comfort."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently shook her head to the answer. "That's all...Good to know, but it's not quite what I was thinking about. Just...Imagine a scenario for a moment. You know how much I love blueberries. So let's say I have a blueberry pie. But then I see someone really hungry. And they won't accept a blueberry pie from me no matter how much I insist. So I tell them I don't like blueberry pie at all, or that I'm full. Or something. That I...Misrepresent, maybe even lie about my emotions to get what I want from someone. Obviously in this imaginary scenario, I have the best intentions, and it's of such little consequence that it hardly matters." She paused a moment, looking down as she collected herself. "...So, as best you can, try to transpose that to another situation where, despite the best intentions, someone gets very hurt over it. Where people might feel forced to misrepresent their own feelings to achieve an objective or hurt someone due to exigent circumstances. I'd like to give you a better example, but the more specific I get the more it might unintentionally gravitate towards things that would inadvertently reveal things I know that I'm not sure I should share." She sighed, letting her head fall with a gentle thump against Ella's chest. "This is all so confusing.."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella considered, wondering what exactly Star was meaning in actuality. Who and what she was talking about. But overall....she shrugged. "It depends on what harm there is with it. If someone chooses to lie about something for what they perceive as the benefit of another, like in that scenario, then that is their choice. They're willingly falsifying or hiding something for what they perceive as the benefit of the other, or the group. As long as it isn't extremely detrimental to them, I wouldn't personally step in at all. The example you gave is a minimal impact, but if we do something like say - I offer to stay behind and tell you I have a plan to get out alive, but in reality I'm just planning to sacrifice myself to buy you and the rest time to get away, THAT might be worth stepping in and dissuading. Those are two pretty extreme scenarios, and I think there is a grey area where maybe you don't actively share the specific feeling someone is lying about or misleading, but perhaps encourage them to address it in a more roundabout way. Offering to talk about it, or encouraging them that it's okay to do something." Without specific details, it was getting really hard to actually answer Star's question, but she was trying her best.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The example Ella gave struck a chord with Star. Ella could feel it. The recognition and spike in adrenaline as they hit the nail on the head, more or less. She looked up at her lover, sorrow in her eyes. "So...You're saying if...Let's just say we're back in Cloverport, and there's two of me. The now-me and the then-me. And in this alternate universe, I know that the me who is sitting at the table talking about saving Lissana is just putting on a brave face, and she just tells you what you want to hear to assure you that everything is going to be okay despite the obvious risk, and it's far, far more likely that that past me is going to get herself killed." She paused, looking at Ellesandra with a deep depth of sincerity in her eyes, underscoring the seriousness of the question: "What's more important to you? Knowing the truth, so you might prevent tragedy? Or allowing someone to speak foolishness and follow through with that desire, no matter how misguided or self-sacrificing?"
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella frowned. She shifted uncomfortably, considering. "Depends on how this hypothetical is working out. If we're in the moment, where you are actively next to me watching this other you lie like that and knowing this other you is very much in danger, then yes. I would want to know, so I could help prevent said tragedy. If you're telling me this is something that happened in the past, that you did in fact lie to me and expect to die that day, well I'll knock you over the head and call you a dumbass, but I don't need to know that. There's no action connected to that knowledge. If there's no action to be taken upon learning whatever you'd share, then why share it?" She shrugged. "What's done is done, then. You came out of that and survived. Next time, share that so I can stop you from being suicidal because we both agreed, No Death. Or share it if Amelia or Amara are being reckless like that too, so we can work to ensure no death for everyone. But if it's something that already happened and we all already came out of it alive, then there's no reason to go back to it I don't think?" Ellesandra was obviously not picking up the specific scenario Star had in mind for this one, and how that knowledge might change the way she felt about the events. Ella was a woman of action. Knowing something and not being able to do anything about it would just frustrate her, so her answer felt obvious to her.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded to Ella's words, accepting their feelings even if the disappointment was clear. "That isn't how it was, just to be clear. I knew I would make it out alive, one way or another. Knowing now that Valentina was involved would have...Changed my calculus in the moment, but hindsight is twenty-twenty as they say," she said, her voice dispirited and dragged through the proverbial mud. "There are still some ways this gift feels like a curse, my love," she said, then moved to lay her head down on Ella's heart. "I'm okay, just to be clear, just..." She sighed through her nose. "My heart needs some time with that answer. Some pain lingers on long after the moment of action and...Accepting that it isn't my place to fix that is hard. I hate to see people suffer, you know? Not just you - especially you, of course, but...Others. Everyone. Anyone. Even just accepting that it was the right call not to divert and help the people of Neet with that beast...Knowing that even if we had done so and spent a day of rest after, we'd still be on time for this airship." She sighed again. "I need you to squeeze me a bunch right now."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She felt the disappointment. That meant that whatever she'd been considering - because there was no doubt Star had something specific in mind when asking this - wasn't something that would require action anymore. And therefore, Star wasn't going to share with her. Curiosity bubbled up, but it was just morbid curiosity and not something Ella would act upon. She'd be curious about plenty of things Star saw, but she'd rather ask the person themselves what was going on rather than have Star share it without that person's permission. And in this situation, she didn't even know who it was Star was talking about. Her hand had begun lightly running along the back of Star's head, where she would be running fingers through hair if it hadn't been braided. "You can't fix everything, love." Her words were gentle, and she leaned in to press a soft kiss against the top of Star's head again, then squeezed her tight when Star requested it. She didn't let go, just squeezing her and keeping her close. Ella wanted Star to feel protected, loved, and cared for in this embrace, so she kept her held close and tight. "And I regret not helping with that beast as well. It was most of a day walk and back to just Neet, let alone to the south of it and back, or I would have recommended we go take care of it in the downtime. But we'd be cutting it too close, even if we stretched ourselves thin with travel."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded. "I know. I'd have immediately suggested we turn and go there if that wasn't the case. But it's just too close. And I know where the goal is. But damned if this isn't why I have always fought so hard for other people in the moment," she said, a very significant anger welling in her chest. Self-directed anger. Not hate, she was trying very hard not to blame herself. But the idea that people in Neet would continue to suffer, that they likely had the power to help but were overly focused on their objective, perhaps even rightly so, clashed deeply with her own ideals. She wasn't disagreeing with Ella. It just hurt. A lot. Just as it would have hurt her deeply if she had refused to help Morrun with Lissana. A few wet drops landed on Ella's chest, but Star kept herself steady. Just a few tears. The people of Neet, perhaps those who might die who didn't have to, who might be slain by this crimson beast when they could have helped...They deserved at least a few tears. It brought her into a small spiral, thinking back to the memory of Marigold. She believed the princess so misguided in that moment, even if she knew precisely what Marigold wanted to do. Where altruism crossed the border into recklessness and ended badly. Understanding it, however, and facing the truth was another matter. "I hate how much suffering there is in the world, Ella...I hate it..." She was still okay. Her emotions might spike, but they were being reigned back in slowly, and Ella's hold was comforting her. She was having a moment...But Ella's presence did wonders to keep her feeling okay through it.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella continued to just hold Star. Gentle brushing of her hand up and down Star's back while squeezing with her other one. A few kisses to the top of her head as she felt the tears on her skin. She didn't say anything about them, just supporting and protecting and loving Star while she worked through the grief of suffering and seeing others suffer like that. There was silence following Star's comment about suffering itself, and how much there was in the world. Ella lay there, considering this for a while. She raised her feet to lightly hook over Star's legs, another form of holding onto her tightly, before finally speaking. "I agree, though I remember something Sia once told me. She said that it sucks being weak, being bad at something, making mistakes. But unless you experience that, you won't truly appreciate it when you're good at it, or you see someone really good at it. The dichotomy of the two is necessary for the being good at it to be fulfilling, to matter. If there weren't people who were bad at fighting, then people like myself wouldn't need to exist." She paused for a moment, kissing Star's head before continuing to complete the analogy. "I think that applies to happiness, too, right? you're the one who said you have to feel all emotions. Suffering sucks, especially when there's too much of it at once for someone. But it's also necessary to make the happy, good times truly feel special." Or something like that. Ella was talking out of her ass to try to cheer Star up a little, and entirely unsure if she would be making it worse.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star could feel the effort Ella was putting behind her words to try and cheer her up. She appreciated the sentiment more than the words in this case, as she logically had already been the one to explain that the balance of emotions. How pain gave way to happiness, and such. The reassurance was nice, of course. But this was not a problem of logical understanding, so it came down to Ella's sentimental efforts, which were very much appreciated and received, including their legs tangling up with hers. She lifted her head, still a bit misty, and smiled at her lover. She still had bad emotions to work through, of course. They weren't just going away. But she had comfort with her lover, and that was very much impactful. "I know, love. The pain will give way to happiness in time. But swear with me now that we return to Neet after saving my mother, and if that beast still hounds them that we slay it for them. We can only hope that they stay safe, until then." Logically, it had been said that the beast was plaguing them for a long time, so it stood to reason that if they got this whole adventure resolved within the next few weeks, they could circle back and it would hopefully be before anyone else got hurt. "But hey," she said, smiling wider. "Listen to you, talking about balance of emotions, and how you need happiness, how the struggle makes the good times all the better. It makes me happy to think that you can hold happy, special times in your heart, my love." There was a 'after everything you've been through' that almost followed that, but Star felt it went without saying. Ella thought themselves broken. But if that was true, Ella was fighting harder than any broken person she'd ever known, and sometimes all it seemed to take was focus on someone else for Ella to see the truth.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She nodded. That was an easy thing to swear. "I swear. And also, I'll see if I can chat with anyone from this fort when we're getting on the airship. Maybe they could send a person or two to, at the very least, dissuade the beast from coming near if they can't spare the men to take it out right now." She had meant to do that when talking to the captain the night before, but it had honestly slipped her (cough, the player's) mind. When Star tried to compliment her on talking about the balance of emotion, she rolled her eyes. "That's...different." She said that so poutily and grumpily, it might have been cute. Like Amelia might deny doing something good. Her lips turned into a frown and she turned to look away. But then after a moment, she DID add - "Being with you makes me happy, you know." The words were whispered, as if she were afraid to admit it. Afraid to say those words out loud, lest something hear her and jinx her to ruin it. To make things worse simply because she'd verbally expressed happiness, something she didn't actually think she deserved.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The tsundere was with its natural weakness among an auramancer, whose power allowed them to see straight through dishonesty to one's self. So when Ella went on to say it was different, Star just put on a wide grin. And when being told that being with her made Ella happy? She smiled even wider and leaned in to pepper a few kisses up Ella's neck to push a biiiiiiiiiig, over-the-top smooch onto their cheek, then giggled. "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmwah~ ehe. Being with you makes me happy, too, Ella. And there's nothing wrong with saying that. And for the record? It's not different at all. I...Know it's a bit of a touchy subject for you but...It's okay to be happy. It makes me happy, when you're happy. Just like I'm sure the reverse is true. And you DO make me happy. You do comfort me. You do make life that much more worth living, just for being part of mine. I love you, Ella."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella winced at the kisses and the over the top smooch, including the long mwah. It wasn't that she was actually flinching away from Star's affection, or disliking her love and attention, but more feeling incredibly awkward and uncomfortable by the type of attention and topic. She shook her head at the idea of it not being different at all. "It is, and there is something wrong with saying it. The damn deities will hear it and go 'Oh she's had too good of a time lately, let's throw a wrench in her life' like they always do." Okay, pessimistic Ella was back out, but she wasn't upset or anything. She just leaned in to smooch Star's cheek at her love declaration. "And I love you too." That was about enough cuddles and love for her right now though. She felt too...SEEN. Too much of a focus, and it was making her awkward and shy. Not that she'd ever admit to being such, and she'd deny it if Star ever called her out on it, but still. She lightly moved to roll Star off of her, gentle, gave her another kiss and then moved to stand so that she could stretch her legs and arms. There was a brief wince when stretching her right arm, but she did so anyways - the muscles there needed to be stretched even if they were sore when she did so. "Lets say we hop into the water to rinse off again and then head back towards camp?"
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was sure to roll off when she was guided off, knowing she tripped a tripwire there a little, but she wasn't dissuaded. She rose to her feet and took Ella's left hand, looking forward over the ocean, so that she could say her piece without forcing Ella to acknowledge it or respond. "Even if the gods themselves stand in our way, I won't let them stop us from having our happy life with our family together. With Luna. With my mom. All that we saw. I'll defy them, and I'll live. Somehow...Someway. I will come out the other side of all this by your side, alive and well." Very much emphasis on her surviving. "And we'll take every step together." Another emphatic point, that they'd do it together instead of Star being reckless and doing something dumb alone. "I'm not a violent person. But even I'm not above slugging someone in the jaw if they try to tell you that you don't deserve happiness, Ella." And with that, she stepped forward into the water, gingerly pulling Ella along with her so they could wash off and head back to the camp, as they said.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella glanced over to Star, smiled, then frowned. "Star, you're not allowed to punch a god in the face." She said, in a very mock serious tone. "And if you plan on slugging anyone, I should probably teach you how to throw a punch so you don't break your hand." Okay, so she was responding to that very serious emphasis reassurance from Star, and confession of being willing to defend their love, with humor. She wasn't sure how else to respond to it, so humor it was. She did take Star's hand and walk into the water with her, tail swishing one way then another momentarily with a smirk that might have given off her mischievous plan. As soon as they'd gotten in to their waist she took a handful of water and splashed Star in the face. She was immediately swimming away - awkwardly so since swimming hurt her right arm, but swimming nonetheless. And as she swam away, she was sure to kick the water enough that if Star tried to follow her, she'd get splashed again.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Watch me," was all she had to say to Ella saying she wasn't allowed to punch a god in the face. Sure, she acknowledged the humour. But there was a very, very powerful conviction in her heart with those words. The future she saw with Ella was important to her. Inspiring to her. She was going to grasp it at any cost, and was not going to let anything, not even the gods themselves, stand in her way. Of course...A god actually standing in her way would prove her mortality rather swiftly. But provided she didn't actually evoke any gods to smite her in that moment, she was going to hold onto her bravado. She was going to stand up for Ella. For their future. For it all. She wasn't going to give in. Ever. And if it would be her end, she could die knowing she did everything she could, though she would never dare let her end be anything short of her doing it hand in hand with Ella, fully believing they were just as ready to fight to their last breath for it, too. The seriousness faded when Ella went on to go swimming and splashing Star. She giggled at that, chasing after Ella while giggling and shielding her face from the splashing before diving to swim alongside Ella. Though Star was not the most physically strong, she still had a nimbleness to her that served her well in combat, which also extended to the water, as she showed in her effortless form that had her gliding through the waters with a perhaps alluring wave of her body, like a mermaid, that broke into a backstroke that saw her gracefully gliding through the water and at least keeping pace with Ella, as the wound in their right arm hampered them from truly capitalizing on their strength advantage over Star to push through the water.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She had rolled her eyes at Star's bravado, smirking to it, and then as they had begun swimming and Star swam up to her - easily, since Ella wasn't pushing herself to swim at full speed considering her arm - she rolled her eyes again. "Show off!" She shouted while swimming, eyeing Star doing an effortless backstroke. Waiting until Star wouldn't be able to easily dodge, she reached out and grabbed her hip, shoving her down into the water with the intention of dunking her. She didn't shove hard, only enough to cause her to break the surface of the water, and was swimming away again to escape any retaliation, this time a little bit further down the beach. She did have the presence of mind to glance around, ensuring there were no critters in the water and nothing on land threatening, but otherwise she was fully intending to just play keep away with Star as a flirtatious way to have fun and keep their minds and topics on something light.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star certainly wasn't expecting subterfuge in this time swimming together, so her guard was down. A single thrust, and Star was sunk with a shrill 'Kya--rbgrblblbbrlblrbllbl'. Then, a brief scramble to plant her feet on the shore floor to bring herself back up, she coughed up a bit of water and wrinkled her nose as the seawater drained out of it. "Rude!" she called with a giggle, then dove back into a swim after Ella. Though, Star wasn't the sort of person to look for payback, so her goal if she caught up to Ella was to give them a rather firm spank, since they were doing a forward crawl.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella was smirking at how successful the dunk had been. The shout about being rude was met with her slowing to turn her head back towards Star and stick her tongue out. Obviously, Ella was enjoying herself. As Star swam up to her - again, easily since Ella wasn't pushing herself to swim quickly - and spanked her, Ella came to a sudden stop. She was about to fake irritation, disappointment or anger, until she realized that Star would be able to SEE that she wasn't actually upset about it. Auramancy made that type of thing hard, unfortunately. So instead, she turned and reached for Star, pulling her in close for a hug instead and placed a solid smooch right in the center of her forehead, smiling at how wet her face was from the splashing and dunking. "We should actually wash and head back, but I want you to know that I'm doing so under protest and that my preference would be just to lay naked with you for the rest of the week."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star blinked at the sudden stop, not sure what to expect. Indeed, she would have been fooled for exactly zero seconds if Ella tried to feign anger. But she would have found it cute and kissed her lover for the little show regardless. Instead, Ella kissed her on the forehead and hugged her. A small bloom of love and happiness flowed from her aura. A flush of pink in the otherwise soft blue aura that was Star's. She hugged back, of course, and gave a little squeeze. Given she had fully submerged and had been in the water a bit, she was more or less already cleaned up, but a little underwater rubbing to make sure it was all clean couldn't hurt. She nodded. "I share your preference but...We unfortunately have important things to tend to. But for what it's worth, this will always be a nice memory for me," she said, beaming a bright, honest smile at her lover, then leaned in to give them a soft kiss on the lips. Then, it was time to clean up. A bit more time was afforded for cuddling so they could dry off once more, lest they make their clothes wet and chafe, and once that was all done and they were dry they were able to get back into their clothes, pick up the apple basket, and head out again.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Oh yeah a good amount of herself had already been rinsed off, but considering how messy they'd been together, directly on eachother, best to at least give themselves a more direct rinse. And if she was the one who rinsed Star, they'd just be getting messy again. "Good. You deserve the best of memories." It wasn't intentional, but there was an emphasis on the 'you' in that sentence. She cleaned herself up, and then moved to cuddle and dry afterwards. She was mostly quiet, just enjoying the time with Star and trying to avoid getting sand all over her feet after having rinsed off. As Star had gotten dressed, Ella didn't hide that she had been watching. Her eyes scanned up and down her legs, an appreciation that she wasn't shy about making obvious. And as they finished up and began walking away, she reached over to take that apple they'd not finished earlier and bit into it, her left hand reaching out to take hold of Star's free hand while they walked. A walk in the woods, eating an apple, like any ordinary couple. If only that were true.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

There was some small part of Star who felt a little hopeful that Ella would agree to it being a good memory for them, too, but it was too small to really notice the disappointment when the focus again came to her. It was not that she cared to refuse Ella's desires upon her, but, once again, there was an imbalance that formed when the focus was so one-sided. Ella's happiness mattered. But rather than argue about it or pout or something, she just made sure to loop her arms around Ella's left arm to hang off them while her head rest on their shoulder. An affectionate posture taken once she was dressed, and having had certainly put on a bit of a show for her lover by getting dressed much more slowly once she realized they were watching, with slow and full bends to ensure Ella got a full view of her bent-over sex while she moved to put her panties back on. But assuming that didn't lead to yet another cycle of sex and washing off, they were headed back to camp together, comfortably quiet together. Of course, to Star? They were a couple, and they were as firmly an item as they could be short of their future marriage.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

This would be an important memory for Ella, but was she willing or able to admit that? Not at all. Admitting it would, again, bring about the possibility of jinxing it. She wanted to just enjoy it, not to make it so obvious that this was one of the best days she'd had in...memory, honestly. The temptation to get them both messy again was strong when she saw Star slowly bending over, giving her a show, and the sight of her caused her to lick her lips. Like an animal who was eyeing up her dinner, though it wasn't caused simply by arousal. Arousal was certainly there, but just knowing what Star tasted like and the sounds she made when Ella's lips were on her, and the desire to make her feel good and loved and appreciated, these were all what Ella craved. Still, she withheld from that temptation, considering they'd already given into it twice today. As they walked together, Star's head on her shoulder, she kissed the top of her head and walked particularly slow back so as to elongate the amount of time they could be all lovey-dovey like this without comment. "Any concern about eating anything the A team brings back? I know meat isn't your favorite, and I'm sure having them skin or prepare it in camp won't be ideal for you."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

A rather obvious lurch of disgust came from Star's aura at the mention of the animal being skinned at the camp. Star didn't show it on the surface, but Ella had hit the nail on the head. She didn't like to see those things. "It, uhm...Wouldn't be ideal. Though I won't complain, if it'd be an imposition for them to move. I-I'd just, you know, take a little walk with you, or something." She made sure to include Ella in that, as she knew Ella wouldn't abide her walking around alone, and honestly, it would be reckless to wander around alone anyway. Not that this place felt particularly dangerous, but, still. No sense taking risks. Star was committed to the whole not dying part, and that included not putting herself in risky situations unless she absolutely had to. "I'm fine with eating whatever they've caught of course. I'll just have a smaller cut, and fill up on apples otherwise. What about you? I assume you're accustomed to eating a fresh catch and so on, I assume they'll be back with more than just a squirrel or two."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella felt the lurch of disgust. It wasn't easy to immediately identify as disgust for Ella, with how new she was to sensing this type of thing from Star, but considering the context and the words after, it wasn't too hard to separate from her other feelings. She nodded at the idea of going for a walk if they were preparing it in camp, though tilted her head to the side at the returned question. "Oh, I'm okay with it, I just thought that you might...well." She didn't feel like she needed to finish that sentence. Obviously, based on what she'd felt from Star, she'd been right in assuming Star wouldn't be super comfortable with it. "Since we're not setting up tents and stuff in the campsite and all, i see no reason they wouldn't be able to prepare it a bit further off from camp. If not though, you and I can walk away to find a clearing and practice some very basic hand to hand in case your magic is blocked, or you do find yourself needing to sucker punch a god, and some of your offensive magic."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gently nodded at the 'well'. Well indeed. Well, as in, 'well I'm about to throw up now'. Star certainly did not handle death well, much as she had to steel herself against it. She could keep a solid front. But inside, she was never okay with the sights. Seeing animals suffering was hard enough - seeing the dead was harder. Ella didn't have sight on Star's emotions at the time, but the time she spent tending to the wounded and being around the few that died in the battle in Cloverport had truly shaken her, and if she hadn't been so exhausted, she might have wept over it once they were in private. All in the past now, all she could hope for was to keep away from it as much as she could. "I-I'm not sure that is the best thing for me. N-Not that I don't see the value in hand to hand combat and such, I'm just uh, well...I have magic for such situations that I think would be more fruitful to practice?" Nervousness was obvious, though it was ultimately true. She'd get much better results blinding her opponent than trying to risk a hip-toss or intercepting a blade.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She shook her head. "Nope. You at least need to know how to throw a punch and to break out of a basic hold. Just because you have magic doesn't mean it can always be used effectively in that moment. Not to mention, a lot of magic requires hand movements and words, which they can restrain." She wasn't actually sure if auramancy required that, but didn't want to ask right now because she didn't want to give Star support as to why she didn't need to learn this. "Just one or two very basic things, I'm not going to have you getting into gladiator rings and taking opponents down with your bare hands. It's my job to defend you, but there will be situations where something happens unexpectedly and I might not be able to do so. So, I'm doing so by making sure you can defend yourself if that happens."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star pouted a little. She wasn't going to argue, but she was definitely apprehensive about the training. Getting hurt was, well, unpleasant. And while she assumed Ella would be gentle, she did still feel it had a recipe for some emotional flare-ups between them. "Arcane magic does, but auramancy doesn't have the same somatic or verbal components. It can be helpful in evoking them, but it isn't the same. It's not evoking the power of the arcane through gestures, it's channeling the power of self and one's aura, which comes from within. B-But, uh, I just...sound like I'm trying to weasel out of things now, d-don't I?" she asked with a nervous giggle. "I-I'll stop...Uhm. Y-You're not gonna make me hit you, right?" Nervousness and a little fear welled up in her at the thought, and her hands fidgeted together while still keeping her arms looped around Ella's left arm.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella considered the new information about auramancy and tucked that away for 'good to know' knowledge. At the nervousness and the question though, Ella just smirked and turned to smooch her cheek softly before continuing walking. "I'll make you punch my hand. And then slow walk you through a punch to my face, where you aren't putting force behind it but to show you where you should aim to prevent hurting your hand. The head is a very hard thing to hit and doing it poorly will break your hand. I'll walk you through some similar spots on the rest of my body, but the only thing you'll strike with force is my left hand, so don't worry." She paused, then added. "I'll also grab onto you and have you break out of my hold, so you might push against me or stomp on my foot or something as part of that. Very basic stuff, and it's less about getting you to actually hurt me and more making sure your muscles are used to the actions needed so you can do it when necessary. Don't worry about that."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star had very real panic rise in her at the notion that she would be stomping on Ella's feet. She separated from her lover from the shock. "W-Wawawawa--wha? N-No! I could never do that to you, Ella!" she exclaimed, as if she was in the midst of apologizing to Ella in the moment for having stabbed them already. She hadn't hurt them, but was freaking out as if she had. "I-I don't know how you can say not to worry! I'm fine with practicing the motions without any force, I-I can't actually hit you or hurt you! I-I can't!" she said, the panic leading to actual, very real tears in her eyes as this whole situation induced the beginnings of an actual anxiety attack. Her pulse was racing, now filled with the mental image of her stomping on Ella's foot and them crying out in pain. As if she could even manage more than a tiny grunt from them at best.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Oh, no. Ella had not expected this type of reaction. She immediately stopped when Star pulled away from her and turned to watch her with concern. When she saw, and felt, the panic and tears in Star's eyes, she adopted a very soothing voice and stepped forward, hands out to very lightly cup Star's face. "Heyyyyy hey shhhh...okay, I won't ask you to actually stomp on my foot okay? I promise, absolutely nothing that would hurt me. We will only do what you're comfortable with. I promise, okay?" Ella was concerned about Star, and immediately trying to soothe her. There was also a bit of guilt at the idea of having caused this panic, though there was also confusion because she honestly didn't know what caused it. There was nothing wrong with training with a loved one, in her mind. It was actually better to do it with someone you cared for, because you'd be more careful and pay more attention than if it was someone you didn't like. Then again, with Star, it might cause arousal in some situations, but Ella wasn't exactly planning on showing her grappling techniques where they'd be rolling around on the ground. Just a couple basic defensive techniques. Still, she didn't want to make Star panic like this, and would go out of her way to ensure that Star felt comfortable with it if she agreed to do it. That guilt for making Star feel pressured to do so rose, but she also felt like it was necessary. She didn't trust magic to always be accessible, even if it was auramancy.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was immediately comforted by Ella's calming words and tone. She was okay. But whether Ella put together the pieces or not, Star still had a deep cut in her heart from how she had yelled, trying to be supportive, at Ella in the past. The things she'd done to unintentionally hurt them. Ella's insistence that she not blame herself wasn't enough to keep her from doing exactly that, at least subconsciously. So the notion of physically hurting Ella? It was enough to make her hands visibly shake with panic. But then Ella's comforts came, and the panic subdued slightly. Then a bit more. Then slowly began to fade away until she approached calm again. She gently nodded. "O-Okay, n-no hurting you.." she said, echoing it for her own comforts. She nodded again, a self-soothing gesture to affirm that she wouldn't hurt them. After that though, she just needed a minute to process things. She was on the way back to feeling okay. It was just a momentary panic, after all. She wasn't out of control. But her heart was definitely racing now. Enough that she hadn't been able to focus on the guilt she'd caused in Ella just yet. But she definitely needed a hug, once Ella was done holding her face.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella gently stroked her thumbs over Star's cheeks, then leaned in to press her lips to Star's forehead. As soon as she was nodding, having calmed a bit more, she slid her fingers down her neck, to her shoulders, and then fully around her to pull her in closely. Ella held her gently, being careful to let Star pull away if she was feeling overwhelmed or needed distance - like Ella might after a panic attack - but she also knew Star preferred the physical touch, so was offering it freely and happily. Her head turned and she rested her chin on Star's shoulder, pressing her cheek against the side of Star's own head. "I'm sorry I made you panic like that. Will you share what it is that caused that, so I can avoid it in the future?" Ella was an action oriented person. She had no idea what it was that caused Star to panic. In her mind, training obviously came with hitting one another. As long as both people consented to that, then there wasn't anything wrong with it. It wasn't like when the King stomped on her hand, and she hadn't even thought of that in this situation. There was no connection between the two in her mind. Star had seen the memory of her training with Sia, how she'd thrived and loved being taught that she left something open by Sia hitting her there. It was how Ella had learned - so she'd been about to teach Star in a similar way. Oh, she'd have been a bit more gentle than Sia probably was with her, but to Ella this was all normal and she couldn't, for the life of her, figure out why Star had panicked. But obviously she had, and Ella wanted to make sure she didn't cause that again.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star was the opposite of Ella in that respect. If she was overwhelmed, she wanted, NEEDED to be in Ella's arms. This was her comfy place. Its effects were immediately felt. She was soothed by the kiss and the hold. Breaths eased, and she found some more calm in the arms of her lover. When asked about what caused it, of course Star was open and honest with her answer. "I-I just...Had a mental image of hurting you, of me actually stomping on your foot, hard. It's just the mental image I got. It's not your fault. J-Just, just an intrusive thought but, gods...Ella...I...I can't stand you being hurt. It's so hard to watch you fight sometimes and get hurt. I know, I know in my head...I know logically it's unavoidable. And I have to accept it, and be ready to help. But the idea that I would ever hurt you? Even a little? It...It hurts me, you know? I can't handle that idea. I can't hurt you. I love you. And the times I've already hurt you are s-still, uhm...Still raw for me, I guess..."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella held Star gently. Her hands began gently massaging and rubbing Star's back up and down. She wasn't used to this type of comforting so didn't really know what to do, other than just hold Star. So like the previous times this happened, she just did that. "Star, love." She said, gently. "The only time you ever have to feel bad about hurting me is if you do it intentionally." Said the pot to the kettle. "I promise you, I am a big girl, and it's okay. I know you aren't hurting me intentionally, and even if you do hurt me during training, I expect that in some ways. Not that I expect you to, and I'll go slow so you don't, but if something did happen to where you did - well. You remember that memory with Sia, right? Where we were training? I'm used to things like that in training. I doubt anything you could do to me would push me as far as that did." Ella wasn't exactly a good pep talker, but hey, she was trying. She did have the soft, gentle voice down at least. Not yelling at Star for having panicked, but instead trying to soothe and protect. She squeezed again, giving a glance around over Star's shoulder just to keep guard, but otherwise held Star gently, even beyond just her panic calming. She wanted Star to know she was okay, and that there was nothing wrong with this.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

The sweeping eyes of the knight continue to find this area to be free of any other people. The occasional animal far in the distance was about all those still-vulpine eyes might see. Star was comforted well by Ella's words and her approach. Gentleness and soothing words and tone were what Star needed. "I'd never.." she said softly to the notion of hurting Ella intentionally. That was kinda the whole point here. She was being asked to hurt Ella, at least that was what she took away from it initially, and it evoked a visceral rejection in her. She could not, would not, do that. Even to the point of making her training ineffective. When Ella was done speaking, she separated just slightly, so she could look at her lover. She was okay. A little shaken, but the quick walk back from the panic got her back and level. She looked into her lover's eyes with upturned brows, a look of sympathy. "Just because you're used to something doesn't mean it's something you should have to endure.." she said, knowing that Ella just meant training, and it was truly quite reasonable to have injuries come about as a result of training. Just part of the learning process, and some pain helped make a better fighter. But Star was...Not really thinking about any of that as she spoke those words. She was instead looking at Ella, the mistreated and tortured woman she had come to know, and the root of this panic gnawed at her. She wasn't scared of Ella bumping their head on a rock lightly and having a little goose egg over it. She wasn't scared of giving Ella a little bruise. She didn't WANT to do those things - in fact the thought made her a little ill - but she could reasonably understand them as a necessary price for training. But this wasn't about such minor things. No, she could not bear the thought of being another person in Ella's life who hurt them. She was among the only people Ella had who cared about them, now. And even though she was very much overreacting to it all, she couldn't bear to be lumped even slightly together with those other people in the past who cared for Ella...Only to betray them, and make them feel so undeserving of love. Love that Star had overflowing for her lover, always.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

If only Ella was insightful enough to realize that's what Star was thinking, to see that it was more about Ella's past than about the idea of hurting her at all. She might respond in a way to better reassure that. Instead, though, as Star pulled away to look at her, she ran her hands back up her cheeks and through the front of her hair. Well, against it since her hair was still pulled back into the twin braids. Rough fingers brushed against the base of those vulpine ears, before moving back down to her face, holding it. "Star, we'll start out just showing you how to move. At most, you'll step on my foot, or give me a fist bump. We'll increase based on your comfort level from there, okay? And at any point if you aren't okay with it, we'll stop. I need to know you at least know the moves to protect yourself if I'm not around, but I need even more for you to be fully comfortable while doing so. I would never push you to do something you are not okay with." That was for more than just this training, but the double meaning of it wasn't the focus right now. She moved to lightly cup Star's lips with her pointer finger and thumb on the front of it, tilting her head down just a little to meet Ella's lips. Soft, brushing them across. "I love you, okay? I want you to be safe. And I appreciate you wanting to avoid causing me any pain, too. But I'm a big girl and anything you do to me won't be anything compared to what I'd be used to in normal training. I promise."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Ella's connection and sight of Star's aura would be able to reveal the fruits of their comforts. The touch, the small kiss. The attention to her ears. The calm tone and sweet reassurances. These all brought forth comfort and love into her aura. But the anxieties and apprehension remained. It went far deeper, as Ella might piece together from seeing how them saying it was no big deal and they were used to it did...Next to nothing. Hearing Ella say they loved her evoked the warmth and love response that was expected, so it wasn't like Star wasn't listening or stuck in her own head. It was just not touching on the root of the problem. "I know you'd never do that, Ella. I know. We'll...Give it a try, sure."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

She frowned when she could tell that her words weren't helping, not directly anyways. Still, just because words and reassurance usually worked for Star didn't mean they always would. Words and reassurance certainly didn't work for Ella most of the time, so she didn't consider it odd at all really. Instead, she leaned up and pressed another kiss to Star's forehead, before pulling away and sliding her left arm around Star's hip. She pulled Star in close, so they could walk side by side, rather than just arm in arm, and held her hip with a light squeeze. Star would need the physical contact and comfort, she was sure. If possible with Star's outfit, she'd slip her hand into Star's top so that her hand was against bare hip while being held. "Alright. Lets get back before Amelia starts on a search party for us. Or starts talking in my head complaining that I'm an old granny who must have fallen and can't get up." Topic change, something to ease Star out of whatever it was that was truly bothering her right now, and allowing them to come back to this later when Star might not be feeling so panicky in the moment.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Little things that Ella had picked up along the way were certainly helpful. That Star was comforted by physical touch. That touching skin-to-skin was more effective. It made a stronger connection between their auras, made their feelings flow more freely with one another, letting Star feel the consistent reassurance that Ella was okay. Assuming they were, of course, feeling emotionally okay in the moment. That reassurance was always helpful in grounding her, guiding her back to normalcy. But it also would ensure that Ella would feel that deep, gnawing anxiousness in Star, and how it wasn't going away, even with the love and tenderness they were sharing with each other. She was smiling on the surface; an uneasy and anxious smile, certainly, because Star still did wear her heart on her sleeve even without auramancy. But inside, even with the panic gone, Star's heart was still clinging to that anxiety. She agreed to the training, but...It was clear she was only doing so because she believed it was important to Ella. She was quiet, so if Ella was fine with the silence, then there'd be little to talk about on the way back to camp, which, whenever they did arrive would see Amara and Amelia having long since settled in, with a campfire going and a fat slab of meat cooking on it. But that anxiety wasn't going anywhere in Star.
<p>

Ella didn't push it, or ask further questions. She continued to walk and held Star while they did, letting the quiet build. She felt the anxiousness, but didn't know how to address it. her reassurances hadn't worked, and her holding didn't seem to be helping. But unlike Star, Ella wasn't going to push on that feeling. Star could express it and what caused it if she felt comfortable doing so, but Ella wouldn't push more than she already had. She'd let Star process in whatever way she felt necessary. So as they reached the camp and saw Amara and Amelia at a campfire and meat cooking, Ella made a big show of sniffing in the smell. "Goodness, I knew I smelled something good and it couldn't be Amelia." She went straight into humor, trying to bring levity to Star's mood - as well as ensure any attention would be on her, not Star. If Amara and Amelia had indeed heard them earlier, and if they decided to comment on anything, she wanted them focusing those comments on herself. Star was already anxious, she didn't want Star being embarrassed or feeling exposed to add to any anxiety.
<p>

By the time they reached back to camp, it was sunset. The two had spent a good time traveling and cuddling together. Amelia looked up at Ella with a flat expression. She then noticed Star's wicker basket, and spied the red of the apples within. "Oh good, you managed to pick some apples while you were out. How many of them pickled?" she asked, wearing the usual huffy expression. Amara was standing on idle watch, back to the camp, but could be seen shaking her head at the banter. "We should head into town after taking a moment to eat," said Amara. "We caught a big fat, ugly cow looking thing and cut a slice out of it, but that thing has way too much meat for the four of us. Figure we ought to sell the carcass to the local butcher. Should be someone in town who'd want it, could get some coin out of it."
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella looked obviously confused, glancing at the apples, then back to Amelia. "Why would they be pickled?" Amelia seemed to be making some sort of reference or comment that just didn't make sense to Ella. It legitimately went straight over her head. She squeezed Star again before letting her go to walk up towards the fireplace and eye the meat that was over it briefly, before glancing over to Amara. "Good idea. We can get a handful of supplies while there as well, if anyone was needing anything." Ella didn't know how to handle Star's anxiety, so she was handling Star the way she herself would want to be handled in this situation. To be given time to figure it out, process and repress it. Star could join the conversation if she wanted, and Ella would be happy to include her in it, but she also wasn't actively inviting her in so that she wouldn't feel pressures to say anything. Instead, she continued. "As a note, since we're all together right now, I thought I should share with you all I've begun undertaking the card's trials in my sleep. I started last night. My understanding is they're not as bad as the normal trials of the spire, though based on what Freya said also give less power in equal to the reduced challenge."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

"Does that have anything to do with the fact that you both look like foxes right now?" asked Amelia, having just rolled her eyes when Ella was confused about the pickling joke. It wouldn't be funny if she explained it. Amara looked over her shoulder, taking note of the foxy-eared and tailed state of their companions. Amara had found it easier to just not ask questions sometimes. Star had come to find a little more calm among the group, but she was still sorting through herself, trying to figure out the root of her anxieties. For the time being, she was quiet. "Either way, it figures that you wouldn't get the full power of the spire for that. But it's interesting...Most of the documented records on the spire are very vague about what sort of reward there is involved for conquering it. Curious to hear them flat out tell you what you'll get at the end. It doesn't confirm for certain that there is in fact a reward atop the spire but...Definitely suggests it." Amelia was clearly making mental notes. Some things to bring back to discuss in Myst some time in the future when doing so wouldn't compromise their mission.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella's tail flicked at the question and she gave Amelia an appropriately cunning fox smirk. "No, that's Star being her brilliant self and experimenting with auramancy. The perception increase is quite useful, I must admit." And then she shook her head. "Oh, Freya was incredibly vague. All I know is that no matter which side wins, the defeated side or the victorious side of the card, I will get some sort of power or boon that will support our cause in freeing Aurora. My interpretation of the defeated side is one in which that power will probably kill me, based on the trial I had last night and what my defeated self told me, so I'm obviously working to ensure that's not the part of the trial that wins." As if knowing this would potentially worry Star, she reached over to squeeze Star's hand. No death. She looked Star in the eyes so she knew that Ella was serious about that, even if she didn't say the words, before looking back to Amelia. "I did specifically ask if the power would allow me to break Valentina's curse, and got an indication the power alone wouldn't be enough to do that. But as to what the power is, specifically? Freya was vague about. She did note that dying in the trials may result in my real death though, which is why I felt it was necessary to share that I'd started them with you all."
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

These revelations were very much new to Star. She was glad she was holding Ella's left hand when their hands joined, because when Ella started casually throwing around 'by the way I might die' and 'if one side of the card wins the power will kill me', Star squeezed their hand and had another jolt of panic rise in her. Her squeeze was hard, though not painful. Just worried. Very worried. Her head whipped to the side, focused on Ella. Her eyes, her aura, filled with worry and panic. She was reassured by their look. But having this dropped on her suddenly did not help the earlier panic. Bad timing. Star was holding back tears, now, though her aura would pulse repeatedly with those emotions that made clear she was about to cry. On the surface she looked mostly okay, which showed how Star was certainly capable of hiding her emotions if she had to, in this case to not make a scene, but now that the two were connected, there was no hiding it from Ella. The danger of being so deeply in love with someone was, of course...The worry that that person might be lost, someday.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella immediately cursed herself mentally when she felt how strongly Star responded to this news. In hindsight, she should have expected it. But to her, the anxiety Star had about training and this particular news weren't connected at all. And it wasn't like Ella was going to hide that she'd started this and the danger from them. So when she felt the overwhelming panic and worry, she turned her attention over to Star. She kept hold of Star's hand, but her right hand came up and brushed her fingertips against her cheek softly, then she brought Star's hand holding hers up to kiss her knuckles, ignoring any comments from Amelia at the sweetness of that act. "I'll be fine, Star. No deaths. I'm not being reckless. I'm taking things slowly and not putting myself in a position to easily die. I don't think it will happen, it doesn't seem like the type of thing Freya wants either, but with the risk and me taking it while we're on this journey, I didn't think it was fair to not share." She was looking at Star only now, as if ignoring that Amelia and Amara were there.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Amara and Amelia certainly had the tact to let lovers sort out the things lovers needed to sort out without interrupting. Amelia was just busying herself with poking at the cut of steak on the pan with a knife, occasionally flipping it, as if it required such maintenance. Amara kept her guard duty. They didn't need to be told to keep out of it unless asked. Star, meanwhile, appreciated the reassurance. She gently nodded, and some part of her did know this was an overreaction. Her love for Ella was strong enough to make her overreact a little. She wasn't crying out for them to stop so she could put Ella in a safe warm bubble room to never be in danger again. She knew there were risks. But Ella's pledge to 'no death' had, in the past, been fairly unconvincing. It was more so convincing, lately. She believed it, now. But it still took time for that to sink in. The careless disregard Ella had had for their own life, even if it was just on an emotional level, didn't just vanish from Star's worries, even if things seemed to be different now. After the nod, she drew in a deep breath. "No death," she echoed, voice soft and worried, but trying to feel reassured. She was still okay. Much as these things bothered Star, she still was quite adept at handling her own emotions, so it'd take more than that to truly set her off. She was okay, and love continued to pour out of her aura for Ella. Love that clung to Ella, unwilling to let them forget even for a second that Star looked at Ella as her one and only.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

There was silence from Ella after Star repeated no death. She could tell Star wasn't actually reassured, and she was at a loss as to how to make her feel better. After a few moments, she moved to sit on a log and pulled Star down to sit between her legs, directly in front of her, on the log as well. She had Star's back to her, and pulled her in close, arms wrapped around Star's midsection, and placed her chin on Star's shoulder. A way to sit and for Ella to hug and hold Star, which was intimate but not exactly inappropriate. Plenty of couples had done this when Ella was younger, sharing a seat at a bench or in a tavern as a way to be close in public. It was typically considered too lovey dovey for her, at least in the past, but now she understood why it was something people enjoyed. Now, she actually wanted to do this with someone. "Did you have any issues or run into anything odd while out hunting?" Ella asked, looking at Amelia again. Really Amara might be the better one to ask the question to, but with Amara keeping guard and Amelia nearby them to cook, it felt more appropriate to ask her instead. She wanted to invite them both back into the conversation so they wouldn't feel awkward or pushed out by Ella's holding of Star, and a topic change would probably help reduce Star's anxiety. She'd considered asking Amara about training together as well, but with Star's anxiety already she decided that was a better topic for another time.
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star appreciated the cuddling. She laid her hands over top of Ella's where they came to rest on her abdomen and leaned a bit into her lover. A small blush came over her cheeks. Not embarrassed. Just a little flutter of butterflies. This gesture made her feel Ella's desire to be together with Star. She already knew they wanted it, knew they loved her, but it was a little affirmation of that, and it made her feel nice. Ella would find, generally, any action that expressed their love and desire for her would be received well by Star. Amelia just gave a short guff of amusement. "You mean besides the ugly fucking thing we hunted? Gods above, you won't believe it until you see it. It's like a pig that's five times the size, and someone took a flat pan and just repeatedly smashed it in the face until it was flattened and wrinkled and ugly as hell," she said with a small shudder. Star let out a small giggle. "Sounds like a koltava all right.." she added, hoping that her small contribution to the conversation would help Ella know she was doing okay despite her worries. "Hrm. So that's what it's called. Well, the mean looks nice, at least," she said, poking at the now more or less cooked steak on the pan. "Right, we've already had ours, which one of you wants the first one?" she asked towards the two lovers. Star wasn't piping up, though it was natural that she might prefer to only have a small portion of Ella's, and fill up on apples and rations otherwise.
<p>

<h1 class="ellehead">Ellesandra</h1><p class="ellepost">

Ella had to think for a moment to remember what a Koltava was, based on the description. There was a moment where she wondered if it was the type of steak that Star had been interested in trying out, but since it was something she remembered the town had, it couldn't be that. They hadn't had the steak Star had been interested in. After a few moments of thought spent remembering what that creature was - a dura gohra - Ella shook her head at Amelia. "Star and I can share. She's not the biggest fan of meats, and we ate some of the apples on the way here. To confirm they weren't pickled, I guess." The call back to the joke she still didn't get was made with a curious look at Amelia. "The rest can be shared between you and Amelia, and sold to get more supplies and such while we're in town." She also knew that Star would probably try to give her the majority of the steak, but Ella would make sure that she got enough at least. Apples were great, and Ella certainly wasn't a doctor who would know what types of food people needed to eat all the time, but she was always raised with the idea that balanced meals were good. Too much meat wasn't good, and too little meat wasn't good. "
<p>

<h1 class="starhead">Star Lumina</h1><p class="starpost">

Star gave a soft smile, though Ella wouldn't really see it. Instead, they would feel a warm happiness from Star at them talking about sharing. Amelia just rolled her eyes again as Ella reinforced how they didn't get the joke. Amelia still wasn't explaining it. At this point it was a combination of it not being funny anymore and general insecurity, but Ella wouldn't be privy to that. Just the eyeroll and attitude as she prepared the steak to be served to her companions. She even took the liberty of cutting it nicely into easily eaten strips. Because as grumpy as she seemed, Amelia's actions continually showed a thoughtfulness and care to them, that she'd certainly throw attitude about if called on. "Between me and myself huh? How generous. Captain, I guess you get nothing," she said, making sure to call Ella out on her mixing up their names with a smirk. Amara just shook her head again. It was easy to tell Amara was amused, but she didn't partake in the silliness quite as much. Such was the burden of the position of captain, perhaps. To always take things seriously. Star certainly wouldn't refuse what Ella had her eat, but it was true that she wanted less of the meat. The food was enjoyed, and Star was able to clean all the items involved with a little magic that made it easy to get ready to head out without any pending work to do later. It also gave time for Star to calm herself, and she did so. Back to a baseline level, though it remained true that she wasn't looking forward to this training with Ella, whenever it was to happen. In any case, the trip into town was set to begin whenever Ella was ready, and that in part included taking a look at what was more or less what Amelia had described. A dead animal, exceptionally fat, with stubby hoofed legs, a fat but short tail, grey, tough looking skin, and two large wing-like protrusions that ran along the length of the creature's back. The protrusions were hard, possibly made of bone or akin to the ivory of tusks, but was flat and grey. Something that protected the animal's spine and general attacks from above. Its head was a mess of wrinkles and a smushed-in face that was very much what Amelia described. Wrinkles nearly entirely folded over the small eyes, a depressed nose, and generally a flat face and snout. Its maw had omnivorous teeth, a mix of fangs and flat molars for eating meat and vegetation in equal measure. It had a very obvious spear wound in its neck, making it quite obvious what killed it. There was blood soaked into the forest floor where the two had left it, just a short way away from camp. Star wasn't too bothered by the carcass, though she didn't really look at it long and intentionally looked away from it. The thing looked...Heavy. Really heavy. On its legs, it looked like it might be about four, four and a half, maybe five feet tall, but its length the amount of fat it had on it would make it easily weigh in the realm of a full on thousand, maybe even up to two thousand pounds. Carrying it was just not an option, but they obviously brought it this far. The answer came swiftly; Amelia cast a spell, lifting the beast up on an unseen disc that floated a few feet off the ground, and followed behind her a few feet. The blood had mostly emptied from the creature at this point, but there was still a small puddle of it at the base of the neck wound. If there were no problems, the group was off to the nearby town of Lidiera.
